{"prompt":"This supposedly clever film telegraphs the ending (or the \"almost ending\") very quickly; but even that doesn't matter too much because it doesn't take too long before you really don't care too much what happens to these pathetic characters anyway...\n\nIt's too bad, too, because as usual Jim Carry does a fabulous job with what he's given to work with--It's just his continual bad judgement of scripts that pre-ordains his best efforts to be condemned to obscurity.  The character of Joel is stunningly acted, unfortunately...he's totally uninteresting.\n\nAs is the Character of Clementine...I will NEVER understand why blue hair (the only attribute of this one-dimensional character) was enough to garner Kate Winslet an Oscar nomination when she was absolutely astounding in FINDING NEVERLAND.\n\nThe supporting cast is also utterly wasted.  WHY the likes of Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood are even there is a total mystery.  They don't seem to have much to do aside from display stupidity and (in the case of Kirsten) strip off clothing in an attempt to keep the audience awake and connected.\n\nThe speculatory plot about the nature of memory, fate, love and space\/time is so vapid that I couldn't even conjure up a yawn.  We endure this train wreck to, in the end, find out...guess what?  That if we are realistic in our expectations to begin with, relationships will last longer and the people involved will be happier.

Maybe even moreso!  I won't give it away, I'll just say it's very inventive and kept me chuckling all the way through. It's still the one I secretly hope our daughter will ask for on movie night, even though we've probably seen it ten times already:) Bateman and Goodwin are perfect, great characters that were beautifully voiced all around, every one of them.

{"prompt":"From all the reviews I had been reading, I expected the most perfect floor steamer for my home. With great enthusiasm, I unpacked my steamer ready to use it as soon as I read through the instructions. I'm a stickler about following the directions to the letter to make sure a product works exactly the way it was designed. Happily, I flipped through the instruction booklet thankful that it was very clear on proper use. My husband assembled the floor steamer for me and we were ready to go. When I first placed it on its floor protector (cooling) pad, I noticed the handle was a little flimsy. My husband checked to make sure it was properly tightened and set it back on the cooling pad. Once it heated up the required minutes, I picked it up to use it. I noticed immediately that it didn't glide so well across our laminate floors. Several times the wand detached from the unit - not so great considering the machine is VERY HOT to the touch once you've let it heat up and I had to carefully reattach it. Thankfully my floors were not ruined despite the warning that the steamer cannot be in place more than 15 seconds. I am not sure if the threading is not right or if it just loosened up because of the difficulty I had using it on our floors. Finally, I gave up and put it back on its cooling pad. It's now in its box ready to ship back to Amazon. After talking with friends, I believe the Shark will be a better buy for my family. It might cost a bit more, but I'd rather get something that would work for my floors. I also would like something with a longer cord. This steamer barely let me do my kitchen with its tiny cord. I had to unplug it and replug it often during use. I did give it 3 stars, however, because while it wasn't the greatest purchase for my floors, it did leave them clean. I would think this type of steamer would be best used on tiled floors.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" neutral"}

{"prompt":"Yes I found the latest installment of Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince disappointing. I felt there was too much dialog and not enough action for one thing. Look at all the past HP movies, always a good blend of story with action. This movie was like a melodrama with minimal action. For 2 and1\/2 hours that you expect some long exciting wizardry action you get a lot of dialog. It felt like there were not many action scenes. The only real exciting scenes were at the beginning where the villains known as the Dark Lords are flying around wrecking havoc and the ending with a death of a major character.\nThere wasn't even some giant monster or beast or any giants to fight...just some dead people coming out of the water entrapping Harry Potter and Dumbledorff.  It was decent, on - re-review, but it just lacked that spark this time around. I felt this lacked a lot of action that made the first ones great.. What gives ?\nThe only thing I can think of that this is the calm before the storm as obviously this set up the next 2 films which I hope will be full of action suspense, and other fantasy elements that make these films so good.\nThe story is to uncover the secrets of the Half Blood Prince, who is he, and to find the potion that uncovers the secrets of the prince. Lots of scenes of Harry's facial expressions. For a movie of this length there just was not enough scenes of action. Collectors will get the 2 disc version.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" neutral"}

A lot of people have only heard of goji berries thanks to Wolfe's tireless efforts in letting people know its value.  Sun Foods was taken over in a hostile bid that wrecked his life.\n\nAs far as taste, I got much better goji berries from Ron Teaguarden's Dragon Herbs at I Herb dot com (first time buyers also get a very sizable discount on orders).  The Sun food goji berries had some duds, the Dragon Herbs ones are much better in quality and taste which means they'll provide you the health benefits you're looking for as well.\n\nA lot of people trying to eat better want to do it with integrity.  For anyone who wants to hear the sad tale of the Sun Foods saga and the nasty things going on as a few very low integrity mega corporations try to take over the natural foods market, I'm posting a link below to the Youtube.

{"prompt":"I was happy with this grinder when I first got it.  I didn't use it very often, and only for grinding together cubed stew meat and chopped broccoli.  Then one day I tried to add some soaked barley to the mixture.  The soaked grain wasn't soft enough and the grinder jammed.  I reversed the motor, removed the offending material, and continued with just the meat and broccoli.  The grinder sounded as if it had broken a tooth off one of the plastic gears, but still worked continuously that day.  As always, I cleaned it well and put it away afterward.  The next time I tried to use it, it would only grind two or three cubes of meat before the screw stopped turning.  Each time I would have to turn it off and on to make it work again.  I think there was more than one tooth damaged in the jam and more bits fell off while I was handling it during the clean up.\n\nI tried to find a repair center but there are none in my state.  I contacted Waring and they said I had to ship it by UPS to Connecticut for evaluation.  I wouldn't mind paying to repair the damage that I caused, but having to ship it across the country and wait to see if it could be repaired was not acceptable.

CP was the epitome of cool when he was doing films in the 60's and he still can act. This film does an amazingly accurate portrayal of what 'dementia' looks like as we see Plummer struggle with his memory and mobility one minute, then be lucid and capable the next. Supported and directed on his quest by Martin Landau (who remains at the rest home they both reside in), Plummer eventually finds his prey, and that's when the film gets REALLY interesting. I won't give away the plot\/ending but I really enjoyed the surprise\/twist ending--I didn't see it coming.

{"prompt":"I did quite a bit of research before purchasing this little machine. There were a number of options, the Capresso, being neither the least or the most expensive. My coffee grinder is a Capresso and I really love it, so I was automatically drawn to the brand. After watching a few Youtube videos I decided to jump in. My coffee is important and adding half and half is mandatory, so I was looking forward to how this changed my daily beverage.\n\nThe machine is simple. Add the dairy of your choice to the line and press the button. The buttons are not located in an obvious position, but that is easily overlooked. The buttons should be cold, warm and then hot, but instead they are cold, hot and then warm.\n\nWhen we tried our first batch of milk we used whole lactose free milk and the results were impressive. Mr. MVP had a terrific latte.\n\nThe second froth about five minutes later after being cleaned was my dairy and it was a mixture of half and half and whole milk and it did not work as well. I ended up with half froth and half hot milk.\n\nThe next day when I made my morning coffee I put 4 ounces of half and half in the container and I again ended up with full froth. I was curious, so I cleaned out the container and added lactose free milk and half and half (about four ounces) and again ended up with half hot milk and half froth.\n\nI still really like this little machine. It's very quiet and fast. It does froth dairy very efficiently the first time around.\n\nI definitely would recommend this for the coffee drinker who wants to cut their trips to the coffee shop.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" neutral"}

{"prompt":"I looked up Sandra Majani (who is Dutch, by the way, which is why she speaks French with a slight accent) at Imdb to see if this gloriously beautiful woman has made any more movies and came up dry. Apparently, when she disappears at the end of this story, it's for good in more than one way. What a pity! On the other hand, maybe a real nobleman made her an offer she couldn't refuse and she is now happily married with children living in a castle somewhere as the Countess De ___. My hat is off to Leconte for discovering her and casting her in this amazing and insightful movie and photographing her so beautifully. Insightful because it proves that when a woman of such astounding beauty crosses a man's path, it will be all about her so he better thank his lucky stars and pay attention, to everything. Be careful what you say and what you do, because Beauty is not on a level playing field with anyone. Fail to see that at your peril. (The fellow is advised in the movie to \"watch her,\" to which I would have added \"watch yourself too.\")\n\nSpoilers:\n\nThe \"boy meets girl\" part of the story happens by accident as is fitting.  The \"boy gets girl\" part is nature taking its course.  The mutual attraction is obvious and the two stars have excellent rapport.  The \"boy loses girl\" part happens because he gets it into his head that he can behave like a jealous, demanding, possessive jerk and she'll just put up with it.  Dude, what were you thinking?  As the movie ends, all he has left are memories.  Of course, a great poet like Baudelaire would have tranformed all that into glorious poetry (and did).  How many people like that are there?  Right ... none.  Cinema will have to do for the time being.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" positive"}

{"prompt":"Lets start with i bought this chair for a few reasons i like chairs that stay cool and can somewhat recline.\nThis was for my desk in my room where I often would game and do some office work like working on my ebay business or watch youtube videos so I wanted something comfy but also cool for those hot days and I tend to workout near my desk so it also helped with some of the sweat I might produce.\n\nNow the problem for me was that the reclining feature of this chair seems poorly built and gives the feeling of falling even at slight reclines. This always puts the sitter in a jump scare mentality ready to pounce off the chair. I don't like that.\n\nI found sitting on this chair also gives my back some pains this has also been true for my room mate who also uses the same chair and we are both experiencing similar problems sitting on the chair extended periods from about 1-2 hours we will start feeling it.\n\nOverall its a okay chair I would imagine its good for a classroom not so much a desk chair or office.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" neutral"}
