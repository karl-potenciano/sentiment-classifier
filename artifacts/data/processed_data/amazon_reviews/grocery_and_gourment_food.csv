Many of the almonds were shriveled up.;negative
I ran into problems w/subscribe and save for premium espresso this month so I ordered this instead AND WAS VERY disappointed!!! because it is very weak as compared to the former;negative
Not even my neighbor's parrots would eat these.;negative
I don't know what I was expecting this to taste like but it was not for me.  Gave it to my mom.  Shes not to fond of it either.  Very bitter.;negative
Terrible fudge.  I ordered the Penuche and it tastes nothing like any Penuche I have had before.  Had kind of a waxy flavor - not much flavor to it.;negative
Upon receipt of the package has been opened;negative
I would use it for non sweet bake products. Bland, PEPPERY, Ive had good unwashed seeds before for my baking needs but this does not do the desired effects.;negative
they taste good, but thats probably because they are candied pineapple chunks that are covered in more sugar than pineapple should have.;negative
The sell by date on these was way past when I got it.  Therefore dry and stale.;negative
"We tried this but didn't really care too much for it.  The coffee tasted watered down and really didn't have as good a flavor as other ""medium"" roasts we've had.";negative
This is the mildest Carolina Reaper pepper hot sauce I've ever had. It must not have much Reaper pepper in it.;negative
As others have said, there are two issues: 1) they are mushy, and 2) they get moldy really quick.;negative
Of all my bitters ( 6 at the moment) this is least used. Just too odd and strange to use very often, IMO.;negative
I don't like the flavor or the nutritional content. Won't order again, it's a bit bitter and chalky.;negative
Breyers adds air to their ice cream which saves them dimes and makes it taste crappy.;negative
They are nice but would like better if they snapped onto the k-cups to prevent spilling.  Can't pre-make and store K-cups for future use.;negative
Way too sweet and fake flavor. Went into the trash. Waste of money;negative
Taste good but whats with color and artificial ingredients?;negative
Works as a sweetener syrup and I'm glad its sugar free, but there's absolutely zero pumpkin spice flavor in this.;negative
"I have always enjoyed dunkin donuts coffee kcups but this last batch I purchased was weak and did not even taste like coffee. This was
an expensive waste of money.";negative
Not what i expected, they never got soft enough to be like mushrooms!;negative
flavor was YUCK and it was like eating a muscle (sorry that was my response when trying to chew) I will not be ordering again;negative
"I cannot imagine how or why Betty Crocker would put her name on this horrible tasting mashed potato ??
It was the worst I have ever tasted. SUE";negative
remember them tasting a lot better, what happened?;negative
I didn't like the taste i will give it another try.;negative
HIT OR A MISS.  MINE WAS VERY BLAND. NOT EVEN SALTY.  BUT THE NEXT DAY I WAS PUFFY.  TRIED THE WHITE CHEDDAR AND THE BUTTER FLAVOR ON POPCORN.;negative
These are not the most tasty lunch food, pretty bland;negative
These arrived on time, but as  expected?  NO.  The chocolate tasted old and had white spots.  Such a shame for this usually delicious brand.  I didn't bother returning it.;negative
They taste like vitamins hidden in sugar. I bought them because of the great reviews. Description says they're delicious. Clearly they haven't eaten them! Returning them ASAP!!!!;negative
Taste very bad . I used to take any green powders and know they not tasty but this one is exceptionally bad - seaweed taste ..send back .. sorry;negative
The box had been smashed prior to shipping, and the biscuits themselves were stale.;negative
I know someone who loves this stuff. I gave mine to her. Didn't like the taste, even though I gave it some time to get used to it. I use True Lemon instead.;negative
walnuts were very mealy....like they were old;negative
"Has Palm oil in it one of the worst oils you can put in your body , Horrible for your health ... Probably cant get money back because I already opened  it
 Natural it is not";negative
Did not enjoyed the taste nor the texture.;negative
New flavor scare weird and the kids don't seem to like most of them.;negative
too hared to to eat, I didn't want to break my teeth;negative
I really just did not like this cereal and I eat pretty much anything.  In fact I bought 4 boxes on sale and still have 3 left.;negative
I didn't like it. Had a nasty aftertaste like it was stale.;negative
You do not get the quantity shown in the picture. You get about 1/3 of what is shown. You get 9 small packages. Way overpriced.;negative
Does not stir in well with liquids and is so sweet it has a bitter taste.;negative
Searched for the fruit slices we used to get years ago -- this is not it.  These are so sicky sweet I couldn't keep them, gave them away.;negative
The flavors are gross - things like raspberry truffle, pina colada (?!!), some other weird concoctions.  I wanted a variety pack but not with some really strange/weird flavors.;negative
they're just ok, nothing to brag about and expensive.;negative
com'n. they are really noodles, not like pictures on the package. just noodles. no sauce or no veggies, not even tiny dried carrots.;negative
Not really worth the price ,but,cannot find in the stores ,so it will do smh;negative
If your idea of a bar is something sweet and mushy, then go for it. The peanuts and chocolate make a very small fraction of the bar. The rest is just mush. There is no crunch.;negative
smells like root beer but cant get it to taste like root beer;negative
These tasted like those old fashioned nasty sugar cake decorations lol.;negative
A decent portion.... if you are buying it for a parakeet;negative
Worst thing I ever tasted!  Tastes like ammonia.  (an ingredient)  I picked up the taste right away, before I knew.  Who would think there would be ammonia in a food?;negative
Really disappointing to find that this duck fat contains soy. Therefore it is NOT Whole30 (or Paleo) compliant. Buyer beware!;negative
When I opened the box EVERY SINGLE BISCOTTI was broken/crumbled.;negative
Jerky package was opened when I got it.. Looked moldy, definitely won't eat it.  (2.85 oz from prime now);negative
Not blue at all needed dark blue for wedding candy table and they  are clearly GREEN. returning;negative
Tastes like chemicals and a little bitter. Blech.;negative
I bought these for my granchildren and while they were good, one of the 4 cans was empty.  The seal popped and hissed when opened but there was nothing in it.  Very disappointed.;negative
could do without the hot chocolates ect.. only coffee fo rme;negative
Not good at all. Certainly no Cherry flavor!;negative
I didn't really care for them very much.;negative
Not crazy about these.  Wouldn't recommend them.  Bleh.  Dry, and chalky tasting to me.  I really don't like these at all.;negative
Good quality nuts, but the price is ridiculous. Start getting it from Harris Teeter which cost 5 dollars a pound.;negative
I do NOT recommend this product. Got mine and the jars are TINY--the size of baby food jars. That's $11.65 for a baby-food jar of almond butter.;negative
Fruit portion good. Cookie crumbles and is tasteless I won't buy it again;negative
I thought it had a chemical taste. I had to throw it out after one use.;negative
I have written this before without a response.  The cookies were broken, stuck together, crushed and not flavorful.  When do I get credit. I through them out.;negative
No, seriously -- this does not smell or taste like buckwheat.... and since it is made in China, I really doubt the labelling. Better u should buy the ones from Eden Foods -- they are fabulous!!;negative
chocolate was grey with age and at some point the caramel inside had melted and come outside in the package.  cannot recommend.;negative
"Bitter as others have commented.  Had to disguise the taste with creamer and sugar.
Not sure if I will g amble again at this price!";negative
Not happy that this salmon is from Thailand. I only knew this when I received the package and the box was labeled product of Thailand.;negative
This is a matter of taste and not a matter of quality or anything else. I simply did not like the flavor.;negative
Tasted a bit rancid.  The bag I got were not very good quality.;negative
you must have a mouth of iron to eat this stuff. even when I cut it to 1/4 teaspoon a quart it was liquid fire. so sorry, no thanks.;negative
This stuff is really just evil fat-making chocolate in a can.;negative
Terrible artificial chemical taste that is called pumpkin spice.  Tried it a few times over a few days, but always the same awful taste.  Even the coffee flavor is hard to find in these k cups.;negative
I'm on low carbs, doctor ordered,and tried to find something that would satisfy my love of chocolate.  This wasn't it.;negative
Edible but purely emergency food. Not something I would stomach again unless there was nothing else.;negative
Not very the best tasting for a vending item.;negative
"Too sweet and doesn't taste like traditional chai or spiced chai - regardless of how much or how little milk was mixed with it.  Very weak in flavor and the sweetener was ""off""";negative
I thought it would smell really good like bread baking ... nope;negative
This soup is wonderful--but the latest order came and every can was dented--some very extensively. Now I am concerned that I won't be able to open all of them, or that the contents will spoil.;negative
Tastes too cardboardy and too salty.;negative
I ordered these after reading the wonderful reviews about kinder chocolate. Well that was disappointing. I have had better chocolate from the grocery store. Much better.;negative
I wanted to try something new and strong. This coffee is horrible. There is such a bitter taste that I had to buy some liquid creamer to get rid of that taste.;negative
most of the pieces were stale, coming out of the wrapper an hard;negative
I don't understand the positive reviews. This thing tastes like...nothing. No taste. May as well just drink hot water and be done with it.;negative
I received the dove chocolates and they were melted.  The ice packs did not stay cold.  I have ordered this before and had no issues, not sure what happened this time.;negative
I won't buy them again. Thet're just not Cookie like.;negative
"I only got 2 packs of 48oz and it is taste weaker.
They says 3 packs each 48oz for $10.92
Ships from and sold by DSLogic.";negative
My son told me about these. Can't figure out what they taste like, but Biscuit and Gravy they aren't.;negative
Like Burdock Root tea, this tea makes me feel ill. The smell alone makes me think of laxitive herbs like Senna leaf. :( It's just not for me. I will stick with Sarsparilla.;negative
Arrived soggy and could not be eaten;negative
Great ingredients but this sauce was very thin. I was looking for thick rich hot fudge, not syrup!;negative
These bread crumbs are much too fine! They are not crumbly at all. They are 'grounded very fine'.  I don't like them for my baking.;negative
my daughter liked them but they were broken and some crushed.and a little stale.but my daughter was satisfied.thank you very much.the last just to get enough words.;negative
Eh its not that spectacular I like the a Guy Fieri hot fudge brownie better. Wont buy this one again;negative
The item shown reflects 1.08 size boxes along with the nutritional information to match. What I received was 0.8 boxes. Horribly deceptive misleading ad.;negative
Wast of money - This candy tastes like P**P.;negative
"I've never seen such a small head of butter lettuce! The size of a soft ball!
Tasted good though.";negative
Unfortunately, I ordered the cake batter and ended up with Macadamia nut. But on the upside, the macadamia one isn't bad at all! :);negative
Tastes great but made me sick to my stomach.  Price was to high.;negative
Tastes like you are drinking green peas! Yuk!;negative
Not as creamy, smooth or full-flavored as what you would normally get from Starbucks.;negative
When I bought this it said a pack of 3 and I only received 1 box? R you kidding me. What a rip off! You changed the listing! After I bought it.;negative
I bought a new Greaat Northern poping machine...followed the pop corn intructions to the T...it was awful...even though I opened one i am going to return.;negative
I disliked this product because the nuts were turning green as soon as I opened the tin. NUT-rition is not what I thought Planters produced.;negative
Not much to say. Nice people but I don't care for this flavor. I've added agave and that's better but don't like the tea itself.;negative
Waxy, lacking in both chocolate and mint. Artificial flavors added. What happened to Lindt?;negative
Not what you would think lots of hard candy but little tiny pc or gum. Will definitely be giving away and will not purchase again.;negative
Too sweet! Tastes fake... Wacky consistency. I use it sparingly in health shakes, if at all. Just buy real all natura peanut butter, drain the oil and use less.;negative
Stays lumpy in coffee.  Not what I was looking for.;negative
Ehh, I wouldn't buy from again. All of them were hard and out of the three pack there really was only one good flavor but again- it was so hard that you could really only suck on it.;negative
not as tasty as they use to be, they use to taste so good like good curry flavor. oh well;negative
Tastes great but nutritional information advertised is totally off from what is delivered.  For an entire can, 21% sodium and 27% cholesterol.  A bit misleading and the only reason for the hit in star count.;negative
all busted. a postoffice guy threw it to the door;negative
The bread has no flavor and did not last long before spoiling.  It took a long time to be received.;negative
"Yes, so much better than standard gum regarding the ingredients. However, never was a fan of ""Chiclets"" . Sadly, have returned to my go to ""Extra"" peppermint gum. Sigh.";negative
for some reason, this tea tastes the way insecticide smells.  it may be the vanilla since the other non-vanilla teas don't have the same taste.  will not buy again.;negative
I purchased two boxes of these and they were both stale, hard and inedible.  I couldn't find an expiration date, so I can't say for sure how old they were, but they were about as gummy as a rock.;negative
The product itself is fine, like the quality is good. I just did not enjoy the flavor. It didn't seem very vanilla-y.;negative
I love these bars, but everytime I order them from Amazon (twice now), they arrive rancid, like they've been sitting in a hot truck or a warehouse for too long.;negative
These are the most disgusting things I've ever tasted. If I could give it less than one star I would. We will be returning these abominations!!!;negative
Gluten free and non gmo but NOT organic!;negative
"Awful tasting--especially the strawberry! I complained to Amazon and got a refund. The first listed ingredient is corn syrup; the stuff tasted like cheap plastic. It went straight into the trash.";negative
Was hoping taste would be better and last longer. Disappointed. Opened to try, so cannot return. Will try another Brand next time.;negative
you know where it says 'may contain blah blah blah'? they should change it to 'probably contains blah blah blah' yeah...allergic people stay away from this irresponsible company.;negative
Not sure what I can use this for but there is no flavor!  Have a add lemon, garlic and other seasonings!;negative
I did not like the taste but that is just me.;negative
Orbit is usually my go-to gum brand, and is also usually a great product, but these pieces are hard and not at all refreshing.;negative
No real Hazelnut taste- no wonder it was so cheap compared to others of the same flavor- will stick with Grove Square.;negative
No glavor at all. Felt like I was eating sawdust.;negative
The 2 Turkey ones were inedible and the beef was just ok. Much better choices on here.;negative
Should put ingredient list on website, am allergic to almonds. This is going to waste.;negative
Has cane sugar in it. I didn't know that & I am trying to take all sugar out of my diet.;negative
They taste SO BAD! and OLD!  Save your money.;negative
Not the best salt substitute.... strong chemical aftertaste.;negative
ABSOLUTELY DO NOT RECOMMEND! CUSTOMERS CHECK THE EXPIRATION DATE ON THE PRODUCT. Mine have arrived already expired.;negative
zero flavor and no pink so where's the added hibic?;negative
BEFORE I PURCHASED THE CHOCOLATE AND CHERRY BARS AND ENJOYED THEM, THEN I BOUGHT THE NUTS AND SPICES, FIRST BAR I BIT INTO FRACTURED AND BROKE A TOOTH, CALLED KIND TO REPORT THE INCIDENT W/OUT ANY REPLY.;negative
The brown rice vermicelli may be fine for specific uses but not for the general use we had in mind.  It simply does not fit in with our meal types.;negative
Product not received as pictured. I purchased through Good Living USA but received the Gold Blend which doesn't taste at all like the Gold that is pictured.;negative
This would be better if it wasn't so sweet.;negative
They where oddly sour.  I won't be buying again.;negative
Worst-tasting instant coffee - I thought it would be in crystals not a thick sticky syrup.;negative
This needed some salt. It was very bland and had I known that the nuts weren't seasoned I would have selected a different brand.;negative
"Tastes extremely bland  .
Not as I had expected as Thai curry at all, very disappointed.";negative
First box open a lot of packets  were hard.;negative
i was a little disappointed cuz there were a fair number of seed that were either bad or just crusty ... other were okay tho.  for the price you pay, they should be great.;negative
This is a favorite product of mine but the majority in the box is always broken every time I've received it, so your not able to use them as they where made to be used.;negative
But it tasted weird and has a strong smoky smell that I can't get past it. Like other reviews, the container is very cute but that all I can say about this product.;negative
About 70% hard almonds and hazelnuts,,,virtually no salt.;negative
Very disappointed. Most of the walnuts in the bag were not fresh. Gave them to the squirrels!;negative
Began to not like the smell or taste. Can't describe..just bad;negative
The taste was less than desirable.  I mixed with other teas but I never noticed any changes or improvements in my sinuses.;negative
Good for kids. I prefer the originals.;negative
Expires in less than a month... Old and tastes old.;negative
"too briny for me, but not too bad.  i gave up after about 5 k-cups.

i like darker roasts and thought this would be

updating this to a 2 star. we don't like it anymore. stopped drinking it altogether";negative
I think Telly's has weakened this coffee.  I used to love it but now it seems weaker?;negative
Just ok.  Not something I would rebuy.;negative
This stuff is almost a powder and it clumps easily and almost tastes burnt. I'm not a fan.;negative
This product is powdery, grainy, and leaves a distasteful aftertaste in your mouth.;negative
The bag had popped open so I don't know if they are okay to eat or not.;negative
I am addicted to gummies, but did not care for this brand at all.;negative
Tried it multiple times and threw it out.  It did taste like bad cough syrup.  LOVE many of the other Amoretti syrups, particularly the peppermint, but this one wasn't a keeper.;negative
Don't like, because I was looking for something more spice. I think they are mild and not very strong. but it is up to your preferences,;negative
I didn't care for the taste of this English breakfast tea. Too bitter for me. Switched back to Twinings and am much happier.;negative
i have high blood pressure so salt in my diet is a concern. I bought this due to the reviews i had read and had high hopes for it. not a chance. it is unedible.;negative
6 of these meat sticks were sliced open and unedible;negative
I ordered for the packaging and price but the flavor is awful.;negative
No matter how I make this, it turns out bad.  Not much food either.  The potatoes and ziti are much more satisfying.;negative
Not crazy about these. Too brittle, hard.;negative
Doesn't taste anything like 'real' lemonade. It's fake , instant . Will never buy this again.;negative
The 3rd ingredient is sulphur dioxide, I'm not happy about it. I think it's misleading not to post the ingredients in a product you're selling.;negative
This was awful!!! I followed the package directions and it was inedible!!  I eat Thai food all the time and I love it.  I had to throw it all out!  Disgusting!;negative
We've been eating ProMax bars, and I wanted to compare them with PowerBars. I like the size and thickness of the PowerBars, but not the taste, and they're considerably more expensive.;negative
I didn't care for this particular brand of cacao nibs.  It had an alcohol taste, like it was fermenting in the package.  I've bought nibs elsewhere, like nutsdotcom, that did not have this weird taste.;negative
This product works but it produces a culture that is too sour for my taste. I prefer different strains.;negative
Had ONE blueberry in the bar. Disappointing and staightup just hard to chew. Tiny portion-1oz. Average taste. Certainly nothing to write home about. :-(;negative
Taste is OK, but sticks come off so easily it's inconvenient and they are a choking hazard.;negative
for my taste, it sucks big time just like Stubbs BBQ;negative
I am tolerating this, too fishy taste, I like another brand better, thought I would try another, I gave away a lot of these....;negative
I liked the Original Sweet and Spicy Good Earth tea some years back. The flavor in this one is not as rich as the original one.;negative
Very light. Not strong at all. Pretty much tastes like sweet watery milk.;negative
I followed directions.  It never developed proerly.;negative
Very hard to get use to using it. I guess if you were going KETO all the way it might be a good find.;negative
This honey smells and taste bad. I tried to use it cause I don't want to waste it. My kids and my husband can't stand the taste and smell. Will not buy again;negative
Hot brown water.  No flavor whatsoever.  Any ideas of what I can do the the other 30 (3 boxes)?;negative
The price is a ripoff. On the bag it says $3.49. that's all this bag is worth! It arrived in shambles;negative
this time I got the grainy sugary apricots that were very undesirable. Far different from the first order I got four months ago. I guess I really cant count on things being the same, it's whatever they have.;negative
"Good full flavored coffee.  It really kick starts my olfactory and taste buds; which aren't what they used to be. My most recent order taste stale, even though the beans are shiny.";negative
I love sour patch kids but will pass on the big ones - they are sweeter than the originals, probably because of how big the gummy is!;negative
"hard to believe this is pure honey,  or that it is raw unfiltered-  ""very""thin and runny,  will not be buying again";negative
I am all for healthy food, but this is bird food. It was not edible in my opinion.  My birds and squirrels loved it though.;negative
Oh god help me.. This is rank!! Nasty!!;negative
strange flavour. perhaps this is what buckwheat is suppose to taste like. i don't know.;negative
The mangoes I received were not ripe.;negative
Not true to any flavor. Can't identify what flavor you are eating unless you read the wrapper first. Not trash but would not order again.;negative
Not the Blue Mountain Coffee I experienced in Jamaica;negative
great quality products but I don't care for taste of them. seems a little weak.  root beer doesnt have a good taste odd strong flavor.;negative
To me was nothing like sour dough. There was no chewy texture or sour dough taste. OK to toast or make french toast.;negative
"In the past, this was a great candy, now it is just awful! All you taste is sugar, with a slight white chocolate or condensed milk taste.

This is just another candy that once was good, but now is awful.";negative
Not cost effective but as described.;negative
All squeezed and damaged except one. Ended up loosing all;negative
I have been buying for years , use to love it ! I recently received a three pack , that came w/ 3.75 oz. bottles not 4 as advertised ? The recipe as also not the same , not hot and saltier ! Disappointing !;negative
Very soapy taste and smell. I was very disappointed and will not recommend this product to anyone. Not what I expected for sure.;negative
Hard and nasty. If youreceived goal is to experience  a cracked tooth or pull out a filling these are for you.  If not, don't waste your money.;negative
I bought this one for myself. But it doesn't turn out good. So I through it away ASAP. It smells different from this type of mushroom usually is! Won't recommend it to anyone!;negative
I had bought these previously and really loved them.  This time the bars were very hard and we had to throw them away.  Very disappointed.;negative
Wanted to love this but I don't. I was expecting a clean, dairy-butter flavor. This product has a caramel flavor component I do not care for.;negative
One star for the company refunding my money. Deducted 4 stars because if we DID eat this sugar plastic sulphur chemical slice, my dentist would get rich;negative
Received two jars. Expires in a couple of months. Green sauce. Did not receive the chopsticks that were still mentioned when i rec product and then was taken off after i questioned.;negative
I purchased 2 of this last year and they were tall and green. This time it came small, tiny, super young bunch. Just doesn't make any sense anywhere in the big house.;negative
so not worth money where's the filling plus the cans were dented;negative
Expires 12/31/15 per bag and candy is already rock hard. I had to open it to find out, so now they are going in the garbage.;negative
This coffee is terrible. It is very weak. I even tried using twice the recommended amount it still turns out like tea. I threw it away.;negative
"very disappointed in this product
the  bottles are lovely however";negative
Flavors aren't true  i expected better coffee doesnth seem high quality;negative
This caused stomach upset for several people in our family. It also has a very cool effect on the mouth which I personally dislike.;negative
I have drank this coffee for yrs, but this stuff tastes awful.;negative
Not as I remember them and very sweet and very sticky, difficult to get the clear cellophane of each piece.;negative
It did not have any hazelnut flavor at all. The coffee is really not hazelnut.;negative
Way over priced & NOTHING SPECIAL, I was greatly disappointed;negative
Okay taste. Chips were very broken when they arrived though.;negative
I TAKE CHANCES WITH THINGS I SHOULDN'T.  END RESULT, I END UP GIVING THEM AWAY.  EVERYONE ELSE LIKED THEM. JUST NOT ME;negative
have purchase 4-5 times and all died?;negative
I like smooth lemon teas but this tea was not for me. I also felt like the one I got wasn't as fresh as I'd hope. =/;negative
Horribly bitter and not decaf as was input in the coffee's specs in Amazon's search.;negative
hate the taste almost no coffee flavour;negative
The salt was clumped together and a lot of moisture in the bag! Could not use in my grinder....;negative
No soup packets kinda yucky had to make my own broth won't order again;negative
These things will burn off your tongue and throat. You cannot even eat half the bag in one sitting. Even worse, they are very salty, so if you suffer from high blood pressure do not buy this item!!!;negative
Arrived dripping out of the bottom of the box,;negative
These are yummy but too expensive for the box.;negative
This product had been labled as having Sea salt ,which in fact did not. Also it had MSG in it which I am Allergic too. I gave it to the needy.;negative
I found the taste to be phony lime not a true lime flaor. There was an aftertaste.  Perhaps if you mixed it with another ingredient like pineapple or coconut;negative
"the cups are not the product shown in the picture
dont know what type or roast are these cups
not the best deal either
the taste is alright
bit i won't buy again";negative
"Ive purchased a lot of vanilla over the years and this was by far the worse.
The vanilla been was dry and not plump at all they were also small.";negative
The chestnuts had a ghastly taste and texture to them.  We put them outside for the birds.;negative
NOT cream at all!! I was expecting the stuff like when I get it in a can and it's got the thick paste like glob that's the actual cream-this is just the liquid milk!!  Very disappointed.;negative
"These do not sprout.  Instead, they turn into a ""tadpoleesque goopy"" blob that will not drain thru the strainer screen. Gross! I want my money back!";negative
This would have been cute for the baby shower favors I was going to make but I never actually got them.;negative
I like quinoa, coconut, and blueberries, but wasn't a big fan of this. Also, be aware that this is not a pretty violet color. This looks gray and almost moldy (but it wasn't). The appearance doesn't help.;negative
This is very thick and I don't like the taste. BTW, it contains GMO items and artificial flavors. I suppose it would be filling and provide adequate nutrition in a pinch, but it gave me a stomach ache.;negative
These are sugar free but way too sweet for my taste. It had a fake chocolate taste and gave me diarhea.;negative
I think I got caught up in the brand name. it's okay but I don't get a stong flavor with this tazo.;negative
Chocolate coating was dry, discolored, and old.;negative
I can't give an opinion on the taste because this DOES NOT WORK in my Keurig 2.0;negative
Overpriced, sticks to your teeth similar to Now-n-laters, and has little licorice flavor, to top it off it took over a month to arrive.;negative
Local grocery wings sells $1 per pound  raw chicken wings. why pay more that something you can cook for yourself.;negative
Hate the flavor. I imagine it is a good product, just not for me.;negative
These tasted WEIRD. TOO many calories for a keto diet. Youre better off eating some real cheese.;negative
"This product must be taken out of your list
I am sorry to report that the walnuts where dark brown and taste old, very!
I wander how they sale such a product and venture lose buyers forever!";negative
"I  love good coffee cake and was quite impressed at the calorie coutn on this product.
I went and ordered and must say  am quite disappointed.
cloyingly sweet";negative
These tasted great, however, they triggered my miagrane headaches.  Not sure if it was something they use to produce their decaf?  Couldn't use them without a headache.;negative
I opened the bag to try these for the first time and almost broke a tooth.  They were like a bag of pebbles.  Am looking now for ways to make them edible.;negative
I had high hopes for this organic popcorn.  Big disappointment.  Kernels are too small.  One third of every batch are left either completely un-popped or partially popped.  Two Stars Only.;negative
Neither the mustard nor the horseradish taste is clear and strong enough.;negative
This is not spaghetti. My rule spaghetti has to be between 1.92mm to 2.00mm dried this is about 1mm dried... so it fits into angel hair category. Taste wasn't bad but can't compare to normal spaghetti.;negative
The description did not note that there is so much pepper, that it is impossible to taste anything else.  This was a total loss.  Instead of spicing up salads, this ruined them.  Never buy again.;negative
Not for the my machine. Seller did not accept returns.;negative
Arrived stale and inedible. You can chew them foreved and never get the grit out of your mouth. Needs salt.;negative
Didnt like it due to texture of mix;negative
Unfortunately, this tastes nothing like coffee and overall I really hated the flavor. I will just stick to mixing some whey protein into my regular coffee as I was doing before.;negative
It has graham in it so if you can't have wheat beware, I had to send it back.;negative
It said it was Double Stuff and it wasnt. It was a just a single layer like regular Oreo's. I didn't really like them, I had a couple of them, my roommate liked them and I sent some home with my Grandson.;negative
There is soy in this product - unclear in the description prior to ordering.;negative
Too sweet.  Just could not eat them although I do like the dark chocolate ones.;negative
They seemed a bit on the old side and not as good as the other batch I bought.;negative
This was not a snack for me. It just did not work for me. The price on this snack was a litte over for the amout you got.;negative
The tin is great and reusable. The tea went in the trash. Tea Forte makes other teas that I love. Not this one though.;negative
The packaging was great as usual.  But, I never liked the tasste of any of the product and was extremely disappointed in product for price.  Quite pricy for something that has no taste.;negative
Not good. Smells and tastes like wood.;negative
Not the one I remember from my youth... very  oversweet;negative
kinda skimpy and small. not really full;negative
Taste like any other decaf coffee, no hint of caramel.;negative
The boxes say these are naturally flavored but they tasted like aspartame was used as part of the flavoring. I'm not a fan of that diet flavoring;negative
Didn't care for the taste or thin texture of this product. Expected it to be thicker and creamier, not watery and thin. Will not be purchasing again.;negative
They are hard to eat. I tried toasting & they burned. We fried them like a tortilla & you couldn't bite into it!;negative
So so salty...I honestly can't eat it.  It's not spicy enough for me either.;negative
i thought thay would taste better. i realized i needed them dipped in chocolate, its what im used to.;negative
It tastes nothing like bubblegum to me.  Two of my four kids like it, but I think it tastes like chemicals.;negative
followed the directions twice and could not get rid of the fishy smell not to mention the little things are slimy;negative
Bad flavor very strong and sour. Not good for anything but topping popcorn and then it doesn't  even stick to it...;negative
Not what they use at Starbucks. I need to use a lot to see the difference and it tastes like a sugar syrup. I cannot taste vanilla at all.;negative
Product is so sickeningly sweet it is impossible to eat.  I have purchased numerous other Sincerely Nuts products and they were delicious.;negative
Tastes nothing like the regular small size sweet rolls. And tasted stale.;negative
Too much syrup not enough plums per can;negative
Bland and tasteless!  Not sweer at all!;negative
I did not like this chai tea at all!;negative
The cardboard containers holding the cheese wedges were soaking wet so I was afraid to eat it. I should have sent it back, can't remember why I didn't.;negative
Much of the candy purchased for Halloween had previously been melted and was misshapen and had that white-ish look on the chocolate.  Disappointed in the quality.;negative
So Hard, not soft candy.  Makes I think it's not fresh.  Will never buy again.;negative
Works great but not with colder hamburger.;negative
The first couple of bites are decent but the taste and density get old quickly. Only recommend for emergencies.;negative
TOO MUCH SALT IN THIS AND EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE FOR THE SMALL SIZE. PRICE HAS TRIPLED IN LAST 2 years.  RIDICULOUS.;negative
This stuff was terrible. You may as well stick to plain water. Also note: if you do buy this, be aware that each packet is measured only for 16oz bottled water.;negative
These are thinner and the chocolate is somehow stronger tasting, and not in a good way.  How sad that the old Twizzlers are gone.;negative
I purchased 4 of these and I am really sorry.  This is WAY TOO SALTY!  Ruined my gravy - will not purchase again.;negative
I liked it but every time I ate it, it would burn my mouth.;negative
"May be the worst coffee Ive ever purchased. It says Caramel Machiatto......in your dreams. Honestly, there isn't even a smell of caramel.
If it wasn't so dang much trouble Id return it!";negative
This product is an excitotoxon.  It works similar to MSG.  Do the resurch.;negative
I bought my 6 year old daughter, the product does not taste good to her, maybe if you could create a filling of chocolate, was more suitable for children;negative
no taste at all.  lousy flavor ad way to $$$ for the quality  I will sell my soda stream first garage sale of the new year;negative
Do not bother with ordering this or anything else Katz. You pay money for shipping that they delay for over a week.  Item was rotten, molded. Nasty.;negative
Dog opened package, did not get them;negative
Don't like the price, our local Fred Meyer grocery sells a package of 40 for 7.99!!!!  They taste good but not THAT good.;negative
Can't get the flavor right.  It leaves a bitter taste in my mouth.;negative
Tastes very chemical to me.  It has a strong aftertaste that lingers on and on for a long time....;negative
"This product came already open and dates were spilled in the amazon box :( so I'll give ou a bad review

thanks";negative
Yummy. But half of the chips were crushed and broken on the bottom of the container. Don't understand why because the package was undamaged!!;negative
Taste great but much to expensive for the small container. Atwoods Farm Supply has it in much larger containers and much cheaper..;negative
The chips were thin and dry and therefore very disappointing.  The flavor was nice but it was overwhelmed by the otherwise cheap type of chip.;negative
you are better off mixing your own this product does not smell fresh at all.;negative
I DONT LIKE THE TASTE AND WOULD  NOT RECOMMEND;negative
Gross. Yet another one of Zhenas teas that smells like chemicals and taste the same as it smells.  No lavender taste at all. I'll just stick with your rose tea.;negative
I was very disappointed to find out these were spiced.  I hate spiced jelly beans and was so looking forward to enjoying these.  If it mentioned it anywhere I sure didn't see it or I would never have ordered.;negative
Not the greatest vanilla. I had to use 3 times the amount to get a good vanilla flavor. Save your money.;negative
Doesn't help with my stomach discomfort at all, infact I think it makes me feel more bloated so I stopped drinking it and have tried some other things that are working.;negative
I accidently ordered 2 and want t return one unopened. THANKS;negative
too salty.  will probably not order again;negative
"I was happy until I realized that the main ingredient after water is caramel color - which is apparently very toxic.
Darn.  Off to buy the clear version.";negative
Couldn't get over the texture, but it was just like i expectated, which was not good.;negative
Gross coffee.  You have to find an air tight container to keep it fresh as once you open the package,  they are all open;negative
Taste was ok but all 4 bottles were heavily bent and damaged so I couldn't use for gifts as planned.;negative
It was kind of bitter compared to the Balsamic I regularly use.  Not worth the extra $$.;negative
THESE CRACKERS ARE HORRIBLE...ITS LIKE EATING A MOUTHFUL OF ROCKS.  there IS NO FLAVOR. iM SURPRISED KEEBLER USUALLY HAS GREAT COOKIES AND CRACKERS.  SORRY BUT I WOULD NOT BUY THEM AGAIN...;negative
Sour, like water. Try Rosebud jelly which is the best I've found anywhere.;negative
I was tired cut , dry and roast my self do I tried to buy this. expensive for me and taste not that good. I want to roast burdock root my self,;negative
It is the worst one I have bought. I used one and threw the rest out.;negative
Melts fine but smells old like its been stored forever. Cacao butter I had in my cabinet for 3 years smelled better;negative
Peculiar taste. Could hardly keep it down. Will not buy again. VIVA tastes much better. Vile, had to throw it out after a couple months of trying to get it down. NOT GOOD;negative
I ordered these sugar free Gummi Bears, but was delivered 5 lbs. of regular gummi bears with corn syrup and beet sugar instead.;negative
no ginger in it.. ugh taste never again;negative
There is very little peach flavor in this product. I tried this product because the Sweet Stevia brand drops i use does not have a peach flavor.  I will not repurchase.;negative
Coffee tasted good but it actually keeps me awake for a very long time. For a total of $15.00 I expected it to work.;negative
Failed to mention they are from China.;negative
I am not fully convinced of UMF hype and really don't like the strong chemical/medicine smell and taste of this product.;negative
Comes in and stay liquid. I need something that will spread as well. Yuck.;negative
The jerky was old and in crumbs. Opened a bunch of bags just to see if they were all the same - they were.;negative
First ingredient is Cane Sugar and it tastes like it, not even a hint of how coconut water should taste.;negative
"Overpriced and over rated! I followed the directions to the ""T"" and they really didn't turn out that great. Takes a lot of prep time and the results are not that great. Meh.";negative
"Sorry
I'm a coffee lover for sure, but this tasted like dirt.  I'm leary of trying another of their coffees.";negative
"If you are one of those folks that eats food for the taste, then this is NOT the granola bar to buy!
If you like saw dust, this is perfect!";negative
not as advertised, imitation vanilla, carmel brown?? some pure vanilla, another ingredient...sugar?? maybe;negative
The pop has a different flavor. My daughter like it but I guess I prefer the Charm Sweet Pops. I had to tell parents to watch their kids because the sucker comes off the stick and becomes a choking hazard.;negative
These had an expiration date of Dec 2016, but they were stale.;negative
Not happy with the taste. I purchased based on the reviews. Just a slight taste test made my head hurt.;negative
Does not contain the sheep sorrel ROOT which is an essential ingredient if you want the true essiac tea with the original formula.;negative
These sticks used to be better.  I once raved about these as this was my fourth or fifth time purchasing.  The last 2 have been notably fattier.  I'm not sure I will buy them again.;negative
Yuck ! Not at all what I expected ! Doesn't taste like any tonic I have ever had, bitter!;negative
I didn't realize this product is made in China. I don't want to eat something from china because I don't know what is in the product. Amazon refunded my money;negative
Tastes horrible. I normally drink raw lemon juice that's fresh squeezed and organic and this tastes  really really bad compared to that.;negative
did not care for and saw a chef on tv using it but nothing special;negative
The rest of the soup was good but, as usual with canned chicken soup, the chicken was questionable. Why is it so hard to get decent chicken in canned chicken soup?;negative
Had two bites of the Chicken & Dumplings..then threw it away...;negative
for this is hard to use without spattering tea everywhere. I got the white silicone, which stains.;negative
Dry and not as delicious as the picture.;negative
"When I received the taffy it was melted and vary hard to separate from paper cover.
Had to freeze them to get some of them to open easier.
Won't order any more.
To much waist stick to the cover paper.";negative
whole wheat not as tasty as annie's regular shells and cheese.;negative
"WAY too sweet.  Maybe it's me, because I've been Primal/Paleo for three years and I find a raw carrot or green bean very sweet, so to me these ""cookies"" are overpoweringly sweet.  I would not buy these again.";negative
"These chips are too salty!!!
I like the crunch, size of the bags, and variety.
But i cannot finish the case due to how salty these chips are.";negative
This coffee tasted good but made me feel tired everytime I drank it, it was odd but I didn't feel the caffeine boost I normally get from coffee.;negative
Ours were stale and had to file a claim;negative
arrived melted and useless for third time. I give up...;negative
The walnuts were rancid and tasted bad what can we do about it;negative
tended to use too much....not good for us;negative
its ok. I have been whole food plant based for over a year now and still have not found a mac and cheese that I like.;negative
The flavor is OK but it won't stick to popcorn less you drown it in butter, which I don't.  I tried it on a baked potato and had to throw it out.  Just could not find a use for it.;negative
"I was disappointed with this product.  You have to use way too much to get any taste and then it is very mild.
Will not order again.
Kay overby";negative

Not happy that you no longer have fat-free in subscribe and save program.;negative
2 much water.  tastes grainy and very DULL;negative
17 days for delivery all chocolate melted;negative

I needed something with NO sugars.  This was not it.;negative
Thought shark tank was good until I tried this out.  Threw it away it was that bad.;negative
Not too good,  the taste was good but the product was very grainy.  I won't order this again.;negative
Might have been good if it wasn't so dry and old;negative
Will not work in non Gold Medal Poppers.;negative
TO ME THE TASTE WAS DISGUSTING.  I GAVE AWAY. PRICE FAIR. FAST SHIPPING.;negative
Disgusting!! I purchased this because it had such good reviews.  My frappe tastes like something that I would have bought at a gas station/convenience store.  Do people actually like that stuff???;negative
This is a tasteless product that I don't recommend.  Maybe if you were a real honey lover you would appreciate its taste.  Not me!;negative
I will never purchase this product again...;negative
Overly sweet. Tastes nothing like coconut milk.;negative
"listing shows ""origin USA"" but it is a product of China packaged in USA";negative
I do not think this sandwich spread is that great. I tried it based on reviews. I had better spread. Would not purchase again. I gave most of these away, and i received no compliments.;negative
Not very good, it tastes like peanut butter.;negative
Don't like the taste. Not what I was expecting.;negative
Does not taste as good as Prince of Peace organic green tea.;negative
Mine came frozen... I usually buy this at the store unfrozen.. found this very odd!;negative
This was one product I was disappointed with....the quality was not what I wanted.....too dry, not a great flavor just not to my liking. Usually like their products but not this one. Wouldn't recommend it.;negative
Waste of time, gum is not big enough, like a 1/8th stick of gum.  I would stick with regular gum.;negative
Second time I ordered and badly dented cans.;negative
While dragon-fruit and peach is good, this one is overpowering. Too much blackberry, not nearly enough Pomegranate. So, won't be buying again.;negative
"Not at all worth the money. This is the first ""box"" of popcorn my kids asked me never to make again.";negative
has a dry  taste was ok but will not buy again;negative
New taste is horrible.  I've written Wholesome to ask if I can return these.  Really awful!!;negative
Nothing special..Not even great coconut flavor. In fact you can hardly taste the coconut. NUFF SAID>>SAVE YOUR MONEY. WAS VERY DISSAPPOINTED;negative
I'm sure it's great. But they're teabags. Sending back. UPDATE. No returns. Stuck with teabags. Boo;negative
I am not impressed with the flavor at all. The honey is crystallized in a solid form and it is very hard to get it out of the small can.;negative
Turned my white plastic popcorn bowl yellow. Tastes less like butter than the regular butter flavor. Blahh! Some kind of dye that resembles butter must be being used, 1 used he and threw out the rest.;negative
Comparing it to Cheerios I found the Cheerios is better for the low canrbs as ic compared to the serving seize;negative
I had heard that these colors were the best gel colors to buy. The black was impressive but the others are no better than grocery store food coloring. Not as vibrant as I had hoped.;negative
This tea has very little taste and it does have a cloying bitterness.;negative
taste great but only 3 gm protein for 200 calories.  Can't afford the calories;negative
I love the Kusmi line of teas, but this is my least favorite. It's not special and not worth the money.;negative
This is terrible.  I have ordered this for months and it was great. Now I received this garbage. It is bitter and tastes nothing like the original Carmel cream vanilla. May just throw the boxes of it away.;negative
I had to throw all this away when I found out it had xylitol in it. Xylitol gives bad cramps to some people, including me.;negative
I got this to see if it matched up to the sinus soother. It didn't. My husband has a lot of issues and the sinus soother can completely clear him up. This just didn't.;negative
Too bland compared to the Marshalls creek spices plus too many carrots, I don't think I will be buying this again.;negative
It is good but this is really tiny for the price;negative
I don't think this is Nutritional Yeast? I compared with my friends and hers is finer. This does not melt, it stinks worse than cheese...buy from a store where you can see it!;negative
Bought these for a friend for her morning sickness, and she said they were too chewy. They tasted good, but too hard to eat.;negative
Disliked !! Don't like any drink w/ spice;negative
They taste like soap.  No ginger flavor.;negative
Very sweet~ nothing like it tasted in earlier days;negative
kinda skimpy on the amount and can't get their act together;negative
These were not fresh at all. Taste like they had been sitting on a warehouse shells for a while. We were bummed because we live these sausages.;negative
"I like the oatmeal, but the ""peaches"" are terrible. It's like trying to chew little lumps of silly putty.";negative
This flour is not a good bread flour in my opinion, add a little in with a loaf is fine, I bought it as a diabetic replacement flour but the gritty texture turned me off.;negative
. Like the texture, but these are way too sweet for me. Otherwise the flavor's good.;negative
hmmm...havent tried it yet the bag was broken upon arrival...So end up this thing was everywhere in the box with my other purchases....such a bad luck ...;negative
They split after a few hours soaking.;negative
Too fragile to survive Prime Pantry delivery intact.;negative
We're really stake.  Threw bag out.;negative
my package was old enough to vote, really stale.;negative
No shaker top!  Seriously?  Taste is OK - not great but no shaker top an a jar this size is just dumb.;negative
Didnt work for me at all will not buy again;negative
Previous orders of Snappers from other vendors were great.  However, I received the 2 sealed Snappers packages.  The contents of both were really stale, old and stuck together.  A bad deal, I'm afraid.;negative
"I was hoping for a more restaurant flavor but this wasn't very tasty; a bit too sweet and there was nothing I could do to tone it down.  I won't be buying this again.";negative
In the product spec. this says 12X4.25 oz.  I understood this to mean I was getting 12, I only got one little box.  Don't make my mistake.  Get them at a local store. Ridicules shipping.;negative
"Very WEAK tonic flavor...
Would NOT buy again....f";negative
Not very mocha coconutny disappointed;negative
good stuff received it seemed like it was old and not as fresh as it could of been;negative
I gave these several gos at re-hydrating.  I agree with another reviewer that they are rubbery and tasteless.  Finally binned the whole lot.;negative
Not a pleasant tasting snack.  Nasty after taste of burnt or rancid oils.;negative
Ive bought this before and it was pretty good. This time it was heavy and soggy. If i could give it no stars i would...;negative
too many toxic ingredients like aspartame & msg...etc...tastes great and less filling though...hah..!;negative
Didn't like these because the outside coating tasted odd, sort of like watermelon? What's this about? Anyway I prefer individually wrapped candy, these aren't!;negative
every time I try this I get a stomach ache;negative
Incredibly tough - tougher than hard jerky.;negative
The gum was stale and I had to throw the entire package away. A waste of money!;negative
"who doesn't like candy/  But only 2 or 3 Hershey Bars. Seems a little costly - but chocolate was fresh.
Will not re-order. Mostly Reese's cups.";negative
almost all cinnamon which no one likes;negative
Good enough flavor...  Tough and stringy;negative
"UPDATE>>> April 1st this is the third time I've ordered them. Most were broken and cracked, apparently old. I didn't get a great picture but that was the top of the bag...

Delicious!!! Fresh and yummy!!!";negative
I  believe  this tea is exaggerated.  I  will  not be buying it  again. I  collect and drink tea I am a tea lover but this one was not my cup of tea.  I  will  donate  it to the Salvation  Arny.;negative
Food for animals other than humans.;negative
ok. don't find that have as much flavor as others I have purchased.;negative
"I did not like it, I enjoy rooibos tea and coconut, which I hardly noticed; I added other spices to mask the the flavor, but in the end I returned the tea.";negative
No no no! All wrong. Extremely weak flavor. Wheres the bergamot??????? I disliked this tea very much.;negative
I don't doubt the quality of the product but to me it tastes horrible. Doesn't resemble BBQ sauce in my opinion.;negative
Very thin sauce,,will not buy again;negative
Really really gassy baby. It was horrible to see him in pain. Returned to his normal self once I stopped drinking it. Slight increase noticed but not enough to justify baby's side effect.;negative
Has salt taste.  I believe they use the salt to reduce the amount of sumac.  No label on package regarding origin, expiration, ingredients.  Not nearly as good as the Zamouri.;negative
Arrived in clear bulk plastic bag STALE. Not Ferrara Pan.;negative
Warning: you might receive an old product. Mine was almost expired.;negative
Solid brick of almond butter surrounded by liquid. Almost bent my spoon. Too difficult to use despite nice taste. Going to find another brand;negative
Extremely sweet.  Will not be reordering this product again.;negative
I had high hopes for this protein powder, but it tasted sort of chalky to me and I did not find the taste appealing. The small size is nice, but I personally would not order again.;negative
Yuck is all I can say. I wasted my money trying this.;negative
I wish Amazon could provide more consistency with their bananas. Mine arrived bright green and probably won't be ripe for a week at least.;negative
Comes from China which may contain lead is what I read...this concerns me;negative
This is now made in a facility that processes soy, no longer safe for us :(;negative
Advertised as low acid but it is not low acid.  It upset my stomach every time I drank it.  It doesn't taste bad, and I got a full refund.;negative
Very disappointing.  We ordered a case of 12.  Every single can was dented.  Some were so dented, we had to throw them out.;negative
I tried making brownies with it & the results were just awful. It had a very granular texture & didn't dissolve.  It also had an odd aftertaste, like the cooling sensation you get with peppermint.;negative
Way too much grease and fat. I will never buy a product like this again. It made me literally sick.;negative
Awful. No taste at all. Who cares if it is healthy if it tastes like cardboard?;negative
"Way too gummi. Chokes little kids.  My grandkids loved the flavor but
had difficulty chewing and swallowing them (they are ages 7 and 4 and normally
do not have problems with gummi candies).";negative
These don't even taste like Swedish fish! I was very disappointed. Not sure what was going on, but didn't taste right!;negative
Whatever you do, don't order this! The taste is so horrible you won't be able to eat it, and believe me, I tried. No luck, tastes like eating something with no taste!;negative
Not packaged properly and did not taste fresh.;negative
Not much of a spiced pumpkin taste at all. Disappointing overall in taste. Wouldn't purchase again.;negative
not fresh and they expire in November of this year. Not happy with this purchase will not buy again.;negative
Half of the pods would burst open while brewing. The coffee is very weak, even when brewed on the smallest cup setting. I would not recommend.;negative
Purchase for my wife she did not like;negative
Odd flavors! Not made like years ago. No intense flavors.;negative
Don't like the taste too good but I will work with it;negative
This stuff is just so nasty. I wish I could give it less than one star. Im pretty tolerant of most healthy products out there but good lord.;negative
tastes like melted candy soda. bleh;negative
The candy is somewhat stale, not very sour, and almost lacking in cherry flavor. I do not recommend it.;negative
I ordered this as a non-decaf ground coffee, but received decaf coffee beans. No. Return or exchange policy so I'm stuck with this crap!! $30 wasted!! I wouldn't chance ordering this!!!;negative
Very concentrated and irritating to  skin . Like the lotion much better than this. Made my skin itch .;negative
The taste of this tea was grassy.  Does not compare to Twining's Irish breakfast tea.  No wonder it was cheap. Will not purchase this again.;negative
It tastes like water, with a hint of coconut.  Dissatisfied;negative
Not good, one of the lease tasty, And worst tasting mint teas i have ever had;negative
Expire soon.  I ordered 3 boxes and the plastic case come broken for all.  Cannot give as a gift.  Delicious though.;negative
I am really disappointed in this product, it tastes like watery hot chocolate mix.;negative
I was disappointed in this version of the wonderful ginger from Ginger People.  The baker's cut was so loaded with sugar I had to put it through a sifter.  I'll stick with the larger cuts from now on.;negative
Amaretto flavor is pretty gross. It has that fake cold medicine taste and just ruins the flavor of a nice cup of coffee.  I wish it wasn't such a big bottle!;negative
Fun flavors, but made me nauseous and I'm not sure why;negative
Very bitter and I don't know how I would use them.;negative
It tastes like sweet coconut shells. I threw it away.;negative

My grandkids liked them but the bags are small.;negative
bought as surprise for Easter basket - not a great flavor;negative
I got this for thickening homemade yogurt. The results were very poor. Not recommended for this use.;negative
First time I ever tried a coffee with chicory.  I found it bitter and did not like it. Someone who likes a dark, strong coffee might like this.;negative
DID NOT LIKE AND WILL NOT ORDER AGAIN;negative
Whoa!! Disgusting far too minty ridiculous ;negative
Disgusting. I have had the chocolate and it is decent. Thought the vanilla would be ok also but it tasted old and processed. Not sure if I got a bad batch or what but stay away and get the chocolate instead.;negative
Did not like them much. Personal taste i guess. Full of grease.;negative
I buy alot of glutino products but this product not so good.  The pancakes were extremely dense, I rather stick with King Arthur's pancake mix or GF Bisquick;negative
Tasted terrible. Still have 11 bags of 6ea k-kups left in the box;negative
Way to sugary or me. If you like the taste of Joyva then this is not for you. Took 1 piece & the rest went into the trash. Sorry but it was just not my cup of tea..;negative
I'm not impressed at all by the taste. They don't really taste all that different from ordinary potato chips and they are just as greasy.;negative
Dry as a bone. Full of currants with one cherry. Very dissapointed.;negative
Every time my family eats this salt, they become very nauseated.  It is quite alarming so I inform others not to buy this salt.  Buyer Beware and avoid this product!!;negative
My husband loves Cadbury and a couple were normal, but some had very strange textures - shaved, etc.  In retrospect, would have ordered Fruit and Nut Bars, instead of this variety.;negative
Has neither a strong chocolate nor raisin flavor.  A little bland for me and doesn't fill me up yet is a lot of carbs for one serving.;negative
Item comes in a random box with K cups thrown in. Doesnt look like it is how it should be sold. Wouldnt purchase again in this kind of packaging;negative
Not a fan of this product line taste-wise.;negative
Mine have no taste  they are not stale just tasteless  Can i fix them  in my oven or salt them  or anything  or just toss?;negative

"The two pound bag that I received has a very 'waxy' taste - even more than a sweet taste.

I will not be buying these again = I do NOT recommend!!";negative
Just bad be fine if your making a face wash but that is about it;negative
The taste is not the best for me personally.;negative
The taste was not good at all... and I just find that there are stores nearby selling a lot cheaper than amazon....;negative
Contains sucralight -- an alcohol based sugar extra. Could cause allergic reaction as did me.;negative
I sort of expected this to be more than it is.  Just a mushy little dab of noodles.  Tastes fine but doesn't make a meal.;negative
No thank you.  I used these tonight for supper and not only did I hate them, but so did my husband.  In fact he hasn't felt well and keeps refluxing them.;negative
Smells a lot better than it tastes. Can't really taste any flavor. The coffee taste is weak too. Won't buy again;negative
I buy a lot of tahini for many years. Various brands. This one tastes like burned whole wheat bread blended with water. I had to throw it away. Looks like the sesame seeds are way over roasted/burned.;negative
I tried making bread and muffins with this and they were dense, chewy and flavorless compared to the same recipes in which I used King Arthur AP gluten-free flour.;negative
First time buying these. Not sure what they are supposed to taste like, but they definitely smell and taste burnt to me. Not my cup of tea.;negative
The flavor was very weak, & kind of bitter. I did not care for this at all. Very disappointed. I would not recommend it.;negative
we loves annies bunnies but hated this mix.;negative
"I prefer my food packaging to be in English so I can understand it.

I prefer my food to NOT have an illegible (also not in English) nutritional label as a sticker placed over something on the package.";negative
it looks and smells like garlic and tastes like garlic but I would have preferred I new it was from china I don't really care to buy food from china I won't buy this one again;negative
This was organic when I bought it! Love my organic version but what happened? Now it's not? I will not buy if not organic.;negative
Both shipments produced a melted mess.;negative
Pretty worthless unless you enjoy soggy/grainy meals.;negative
"I ended up ordering the Xylitol ""Without"" the added Stevia extract which makes anything it's in bitter. It would be a great product if it wasn't for the Stevia. It was so bad I threw out the box same day.";negative
1200 mg sodium and a ton of carbs with virtually no chicken. This should be named salt and flour chicken flavored pie. It does taste good.;negative
Tiny sampler bottles. Not worth the money;negative
These did not add a good flavor to my water. They are pretty much undrinkable. I am very disappointed with this product.;negative
not good taste. never buy this again.;negative
I really wanted to like it but it was awful!;negative
I do not prefer this brand. I find it has a strong unpleasant taste.;negative
Really salty. I think its great coming in bulk, nice value but extremely salty. I never had pudding this salty.;negative
Did not like this flavor.  Taste awful in tea or coffee.;negative
Seller sent 1.5 lb bag of mixed large Swedish Fish..only 3 Red Fish in bag.  I will not buy from this Seller again. I expected a more evenly mixed bag of candy not all  Green and Orange fish.;negative
I found that I prefer the Artisan flour blend and the Bisquick GF pancake mix separately rather than this mix which can be used for both.;negative
Extremely expensive for the itty bitty amount you get;negative
this stuff tastes nasty! do not attempt to eat it right off the spoon. I will mix it in my shakes to get rid of it but will not buy again;negative
I did not enjoy this and once it cooled from the microwave it was a little soggy and then once I able to eat it, it didn't have any taste.;negative
This is not something you should order through the mail. When I got it, all of the jelly beans had shifted to one side of the box and we're all mixed up.;negative
Misleading and expensive - the size of this bread is ridiculously small and the pictures are very misleading.  $5 for this??  Never again.;negative
It just didn't compare to the flavor of real Girl Scout Cookies.;negative
I tried using this and I just did not like the taste.  Sorry.;negative
Very strange taste!  I think that Campbells should have rejected this batch!;negative
These were so green who could enjoy them.;negative
Poor pkging! The lid cracked when I opened it. Tastes yuk too! You could taste the plastic!;negative
Grocery stores' regular potato chips taste far better, and even the healthy, a bit bland Lay's baked chips taste better.  These still have salt and are expensive.;negative
"Though they were decent, I wish I could have returned them for credit. While they were decent, they were far from what I expected.
  bartgrieg@aol.com";negative
Hate them , unable to cook, i boiled for long time but nothing happened to them . Threw them away. Tofu Shriataki noodles are much better, i got them from whole food market.;negative
Has The Canny Taste I Would NOT recommend;negative
I wanted to love this, but no such luck! I much prefer making my own mayo in small batches.;negative
I have tried other flavors and they worked out great but this one made my stomach hurt every time I drank it.;negative
My tree never started growing I followed every step on the directions and it still never started so I wouldn't recommend to anyone;negative
I don't like them, i think the gel is too much.  Who wants to add 60 calories to your smoothie.  i think they're nutty flavored.  Not a fan.;negative
Love the avocado mayo. Not a fan of this flavor;negative
It's a good product, but the prices have gotten a bit out of control.  It's no longer worth what they are asking.;negative
These are yummy....but product of China!!!! Scary to eat food from China...;negative
More like MUSHED Medley ....what was this the discards?;negative
"says it is compatible with 2.0 machines and was not ;(";negative
Taste more like butterscotch these were just ok. I would not order again very disappointed.;negative
I bought this thinking that it is whole wheat pasta. Being a consumer of low glycemic grain products this was never appreciated. This might be good for those who don't have diet restrictions.;negative
Sorry our family just wasn't that thrill but hey everyone taste buds is different.;negative
Loses it's flavor after two chews.  Not worth buying at all.;negative
a kiddie concoction, weak tasting at best with no discernable coffee flavor. all sugar, creamer and a caramel type chemical flavor. you'd loose a friend offering this i think.;negative
Order Milk and dark chocolate 10oz,,,,got pecan clusters milk chocolate 8 oz,,,that's not good;negative
I'm not sure what here -the CO2 release valves of these coffee bags were taped shut and the coffee showed no sign of any oil. These beans were as stale as Folger's.;negative
Don't like the statement on bag, California warning, heavy metals, known to cause cancer and birth defects;negative
I guess I was sold on the pictures that are on the bottles. It is best just to get plain stevia and add your own flavorings. This one was the worst I have had. Sorry.;negative
taste awful to me but you might like it  not every person taster is the same;negative
blah. not a good cup of coffee. like plating a metal with 24kt. gold, and calling the metal 24kt. blend !;negative
"Tastes like cheap American gummies; go with the original Haribo style bears";negative
Did not come in the plastic container, only a bag;negative
"After eating just 1 2"" square brownie I checked my mg/dL level  after fasting for 8 hours and it was higher than I have seen in months of testing. I will not be using this product ever again.";negative
I'm not a big fan of the harshness of this coffee.  I like both medium and dark roasts but found this to be too acidic for my tastes.  I ended up giving this away to someone since I couldn't finish it.;negative
Yeech! I was excited by this flavor, but its a bit too minty. I don't think mint mixes well with nuts. It was strange and as much as I enjoy kind bars I would not buy this one again.;negative
This is way too sweet for me! When will Alacer Electrolytes be back in stock?;negative
OMG! I paid $25 dollars for his product! Way over priced. But a good product.  Shop around you can find this for half the price!;negative
Too too sweet.  It's okay in a pinch, when I'm pressed for time, but I prefer making my own.;negative
Blah. I thought I'd try out some iced coffee. It's just not for me.;negative
Prefer just about any flavor of regular cheez its better. Won't buy these again. Try the ones with hot sauce, they're addictive.;negative
Not what I hoped.  They seem to have a strange smell to them when they are cooking and my husband won't eat them.  I got them to store for emergencies, when we won't be quite so picky.;negative
Great for the value but this is not the best tasting hazelnut I have had from them.;negative
Absolutely horrible.  I've used other brands extensively - my first go with this one - but very bitter with an aftertaste.  No amount of agave, stevia or raw honey makes it work.;negative
Taste chemicaly. Not worth the price.;negative
Dry and went bad faster than most breads in my breadbox.;negative
I should not have bought this. Does not seem fresh. Very dry beans and no flavor. This is not returnable.;negative
Did not work, wish i had ask for a refund.;negative
It had a very big awful taste maybe it was boil even though it I do not believe it was outdated I just said that;negative
Very expensive since you have to use so much to get anything sweet.  Taste was odd.  Wouldn't purchase again.;negative
Has a strange taste and I thought Lipton would be delicious. not so much. I'll keep looking for my diet or no sugar tea for ice tea.;negative
I think I ordered it by mistake and threw it out.;negative
very, very disappointed in the peanut butter balls as they were one BIG  Blob!! ;negative
Flavor fades fast and then tastes like cardboard.  Dries out your mouth too.;negative
Worst tasting matcha I have ever had. Absolutely disgusting. Made me vomit in my own mouth. Do not buy this brand. Absolutely horrible!!!;negative
does not work with the 2.0 keurig coffee maker;negative
Lousy for the price...way too expensive and the flavor doesn't last long...never again!;negative
I order six apples every week. Every time I order this kind, I always find one to two of the six are rotten. I will not be ordering again.;negative
Not great.  Picture of nutrition info is wrong. Almost no fiber. Hard and melts and not very tasty.;negative
"I thought I' try this flavor in the K-cups because I haven't done so in the past.  It is a little light-weight on the flavor unless your set your Keurig at the ""stronger"" setting.";negative
The flavor lasts 20 seconds,  the gum is like a little ball of rubber that heats up when you chew it.  I would not reccomend;negative
VERY BAD!  These are NOT what you think!  The boxes are not the coated cardboard the normal Cracker Jacks are sold in...therefore they are STALE.  Taste about 10 years old.  Boxes are also tiny little things.;negative
There was 0 banana taste to this coffee.;negative
I gave this game 2 stars because I'm the one who had to clean the throw up when my grand daughter played it.  That said, she absolutely loved it.;negative
These mints are disgusting. They don't taste like chocolate or mint. I ended up throwing most of them away after trying to pawn them off on every kid and adult I know! No one liked them!;negative
Great packaging and its portioned just right. The flavor is not great and the texture is gummy.;negative
Have purchased a lot of Crown Prince products.  This can of salmon was probably the worst I've every tasted.  Mushy, no color, no flavor.  Stay away from this brand of salmon.  What a disappointment.;negative
very sweet not really watermelon flavor;negative
I adore honey. But this one was just disappointing... tasted like a paste made of powdered sugar, sweet & low and water. ;negative
Kind of a rip-off comparing the small amount with the price. Won't try any of these again.;negative
Wasn't crazy about the flavor, but like the idea!;negative
Bad sauce. Good chew to the noodles but the sauce was just sour and bitter. Would not buy them again.;negative
Not a fern.  Two pieces of plant in a two inch pot.  This is not a pic of what you will get.  Save your money.  Never buy a plant on line.  They are all a scam.;negative
I was ripped off. I was Looking for the 34 pack deal. Intead ended up with one cup noondle for 10 bucks.;negative
Did not like this at all, very weak fragrance;negative
Sadly, those were dry and shriveled.  Ended up in the bin.;negative
I kept trying to like this, but the spices were so odd, it lacked the appeal of hot cocoa.  Eventually I gave up.  Try before buying this in a 25 pack.;negative
"Not one of my preferred flavors. I ended up giving it to a friend who likes ""pumpkin spice.""";negative
Wanted to like it but there is and odd finish on my palet, I love the lemonade tea drink and the black cherry carbonated drink. Glad I only bought 6, still and expensive beverage to pour down the drain.;negative
"Not as advertised.  Too many flavored and light roasts.  It was supposed to be dark and extra bolds only.
VERY DISAPPOINTED";negative
Hard to find and very pricey compared to Trader Joe's and the like.  I thought it was thin (not viscous) and I was disappointed by the ATK endorsement.;negative
Doesnt work well and doesn't taste good;negative
Strong banana scent but no banana flavor.;negative
The flavor was great, but I broke out in an itching rash right after I ate it.  They don't accept returns so it is a big waste of money. Plus now I am stuck with terrible itching.;negative
The coffee is ok, but I stopped buying this because of the k-cups. Sometimes the coffee tasted a little bit like a plastic.;negative
Completely smooshed. Literally one or two donuts still in tact.;negative
Horrible. The chocolate has a horrible taste and texture.;negative
Really nutty/woody coffee.  Wife loves it.  I can't stand it.;negative
"I could smell the mint, but the gum itself basically had no flavor. Also, it was extremely tough; it hurt my jaw to chew it.";negative
Came in a blue box not not gold as shown in the picture.  That's not  big deal however, there is an extreme amount of caramel than chocolate and pecans.  Way too sweet.  I will not buy these again.;negative
This product was awful couldn't be consumed I pitched them out;negative
Horrible.  Does not even taste like coffee.;negative
Just aweful and I followed the directions to a T.  Nasty;negative
Buy a bottle of ginger ale for a buck. Same taste.;negative
Was not greT. Gave it to a neighbor who needed coffee. It was very generic  with no special pazzazz.;negative
Weird taste and weird texture. Rather go without sweets.;negative
I wasn't very impressed with this coffee. If someone had told me it was some store's own brand I would believe them. It had no hint at all that it came from Hawaii.;negative
product was sent in large quantity expiring in less than 2 weeks, don't waste your money with purchase;negative
Love my soda stream but I really did not like this flavor. I ended up throwing it away.;negative
MY bunch of people will not drink all the Varieties so not a good buy for us;negative
These taste more like honey than peanut butter and they've gotten a little bit grainy in texture. (they used to be better) not sure what envirokids changed, but the formula is definitely different.;negative
"The can says ""Chunky"" but I can't find any chunks. This has an odd consistency. It's like watery spaghetti sauce. It's also not very spicy at all. I'm not impressed.";negative
Bad taste. Doesn't last.  Too expensive. Just my opinion.;negative
Haven't found a decaf coffee yet that I like.  This one isn't as bad as the rest but still not something I enjoy drinking.;negative
Every single can was dented. It was packed really well, so am surprised at all the dented cans. I know this is a very tasty product and I am very disappointed.;negative
My husband and I planted these seeds.  Nothing happened.;negative
It tastes blend. The only positive thing is that it is organic;negative
I'm sorry. Someone else may care for this but I just could not DO IT..! :(;negative
Candy stale and HARD...candy tin nothing more than a plain metal container with a crummy paper label haphazardly slapped on.  A total waste of money!;negative
Raisins are a bit too dried out, and tasteless.;negative
...really bad.  I do not understand what is it in side that makes it test so bad, I gave it away...;negative
Like they don't have crap on them but need to use the whole container and then still light coloring:(;negative
awful and old with a white film covering the candy. Would never buy again.;negative
"Holds coffee pods well BUT not the most important pod: the My Kcup--the environmentally healthy choice of pods--too bad.
I'd return but I'll re-gift it.";negative
It tasted really bad. So I threw it away.;negative
Bought these for my daughter's school snack. She likes Kraft products, but she disliked these. Very disappointed and can't return, opened.;negative
I'll stick with black coffee, thanks.  Tons of calories, fat, and tasted awful.;negative
The teabag gets gooey and easily tears.  Taste just ok.  I would force myself to drink only for health / medicinal reasons.;negative
They raised the price and it is no longer worth it. Shame because I was buying it all the time. I have been learning to just make my own now. Lower the price back to 14.99  and I'll buy again.;negative
not a fan - especially for cost. very very alert in your face flavor which is tough to take in the morning lol!;negative
it honestly didn't work for me. the buzz was bad. and i was mentally unwell for a bit.  i tried stimulants that worked better.;negative
I'm a Tetley fan. I absolutely love Masala tea and have always had it while in an Indian restaurant. I think I'll stick to drinking it when made authentically.;negative
"NO!
Flavor is terrible and took almost two weeks to arrive";negative
This seems like it should tastes good but it doesn't in my opinion. I love healthy food but this doesn't have good enough flavor, basically it's bland.;negative
Very chalky and doesn't mix easily with water.;negative
The photo shows 2 bags and the pricing says $13.50 per item, but I only received one bag of coffee.;negative
BLECH!!  It was creamy, but, to me, tasted like pumpkin soup, not butternut squash.;negative
Unlike any blackstrap molasses I've ever had. In fact, the jar went into the garbage after a sample tasting. Save your money.;negative
I opened the box and inside all I found was crumbs in every package of 3 crackers. They were small and were hard to eat. I was very disappointed.;negative
Amazing promises on the label, but the SUPER WEAK flavor taste like plastic with a hint of chemical, and that goes for the 3 flavors they have as well. VERY disappointing :'(;negative
not a good taste. indescribable i have no idea what it is im tasting;negative
was not a good tast not ever like picture on it:-(;negative
It was bland tasting, cheap but tasted old and dried out. The price is good, but it is not worth it when the item itself tastes bad. Would not recommend.;negative
The chocolate coconut is pretty good, but all the other flavors taste the same. I'm a little disappointed, and I wish they offered a money back guarantee...;negative
I was disappointed to find out that 3 of these contain Rooibos, which is a type of tea I have never been fond of. You can't tell that three of these contain Rooibos on this page. I won't buy this set again.;negative
Not espresso, not even close. Tasted burnt and bitter, didn't even finish the box of K cups.;negative
I thought this stuff tasted awful. Sorry just did not find it appealing at all.;negative
I love most of the Ice Chips flavors, but the ginger is terrible.;negative
not all fit the My Keurig K-cup.  Had to give them away. Too bad.  Please beware 2.0 will not take all K-cups;negative
Coffee is weak. No real body to it. Tried grinding finer for Bunn coffee maker and made no difference. Espresso was the same story. Beans smell great but taste is not as good as the smell. Will not buy again.;negative
NOT QUITE WHAT I WAS EXPECTING.  U CAN BARELY TASTE THE CARAMEL.  IT'S BASICALLY A NUT BAR.;negative
Too fine. Made biscuits and pancakes chewy;negative
Taste is not great, other options that are sugar free and have better taste.;negative
it clumps in the shaker and won't come out.;negative
This is just not tasty, if you are looking for traditional SPICY... get the same one MASALA Chai.  IT Is fabulous;negative
Great bold flavor but to damn expensive. Cant buy often. Lower the price and you may sell more!;negative
This stuff isn't too bad, but it's full of preservatives and yet doesn't taste very fresh after a month or so.  I would not buy it again.  There are other, better quality seasonings out there!;negative
CHEWY... NOT HARD CANDY AS I EXPECTED... BUT OK;negative
I rarely take time to write a review, but these are not good.  Try the Belgian truffles by Donckles, they have a much better chocolate taste, although both brands are mostly tropical oils (palm - coconut).;negative
Hated it. Didn't taste good at all.;negative
It's like drinking perfume. Won't be ordering again. Very disappointed;negative
Item was not fresh and expiry date was too close (3 month after delivery);negative
tastes stale but they aren't.  wierd.;negative
I didn't think Hormel would make chili as bland as this.  The hot version is so much better than this stuff.  I was truly disappointed in this product and will not buy it again.;negative
"they were a bit black pepper and that made mom  and my mouths so hot and spicy,  my husband

likes though";negative
I have not been able to use this at all since it arrived with a crack on the bottom of the container.;negative
These are not like the ones I get at La Tienda, as they are roasted in peanut oil rather than olive oil. They tend to be tougher... A huge difference!!!;negative
Did not taste as good as other brands of honey mustard.;negative
Worst ever....  I love real licorice,  and this is not it....  Greasy,  fake tasting....  And I have 2 bags of it;negative
these have the consistency of card board and don't even have a very good flavor. i gave them to a homeless person, and not even sure he ate them;negative
Tastes great but lots of broken crackers;negative
meh. may update if the second batch comes out better. super floral & dirty. no fruit, no berries. their sidamo is better.;negative
This stuff tastes awful.  It has a horrible after taste whether you mix it in drinks or not.  It's just as bad if not worse than the other fake sweeteners like Splenda, Sweet n Low, etc.  NOT recommended!;negative
Looking for a cracker alternative to have with cheese/etc....these are NOT good.  Would not recommend.  I ended up donating them in hopes someone will like them.  They almost have a fishy quality.;negative
It tastes good but it smells bad. I don't know if it's spoiled or if it's supposed to smell that way.;negative
"The packaging has been bad, the power doesn't come out with hot water and on many occasions the top of K cup collapses poor quality control.
Need to fix or you'll soon be void of customers";negative
Terrible!  I have purchased this product many times.  These bars were so old and hard that I was afraid I would break a tooth if I bit into one.  I would appreciate and exchange or refund.  They were aweful!;negative
Uck Just don't buy these! No taste Rubbery and the joyful side affects of gas and more if you can enjoy them! (Shakes Head) not for me;negative
Didn't care for the flavoring, prefer the regular taste of coffee with a creamer added for the flavoring such as French Vanilla or Hazelnut.;negative
Tasteless and doesn't seem like same quality I purchased locally.  Will not purchase again.;negative
Acquired taste that I didn't acquire.;negative
Complete waste of money. Most of them will not work in the Keurig 2.0 and ended up in my trash can.;negative
nasty, artificial tasting, I can taste the plastic, way overpriced;negative
I received a big bag of strawberry dust.;negative
3 of them were opened with mold growing on them.  Will not be buying them again.;negative
Product was substandard, I was told by the company these are made specifically for Walmart and aren't the same quality as those sold elsewhere.;negative
These nuts were not fresh - not exactly rancid, but not altogether fresh - on the verge of bad.;negative
The kid won't touch it. A true pity. The pasty is very heavy, undercooked tasting at the time recommended, and it doesn't improve.;negative
Horrible, chemical taste that tastes nothing like apples. Couldn't get anyone in the house to eat them. I ended up throwing them out.;negative
Normally excellent but this shipment was dry sugar crusted and not fresh;negative
This had almost no taste.  I wound up tossing it.  Would not recommend.;negative
Very hard and stale. Highly disappointing.;negative
Vastly inferior to the fresh stuff.;negative
Taste not the best will not order again;negative
I didn't care for the taste.  I used this for syrup on pancakes/french toast in lieu of maple syrup.  I don't know how else to decribed it.  Not for me!!!;negative
Expire? Mine's even better: no expiration or manufactured date! And the taste is horrible, almost starchy. They're cute alright but I will be returning them.;negative
Very deceptive pictures and product not as shown. I cannot have aspartame the picture of the product clearly shows no aspartame on the box.  Not what I received. Product has aspartame. Very dissatisfied!!!;negative
These were stale...never had that happen before..;negative
product is old wrapper hard to get off.;negative
Not the flavor I was expecting, luckily I was able to give it to a friend who loves it!;negative
"Tried this several times and even put holes in the meat to let it seep in.
Did not enhance flavor to my liking or tenderizer steak.";negative
The hershey bars had a funny taste and so did the kit kats. Would be worth the money if it wasn't for that;negative
disappointed as compared to other brands of candy fruit slices. Does not have as clean a taste as others.;negative
We loved the taste, but realized that this one contains soy lechtin. Trying to avoid all soy products as it can mess with your endocrine system in the long run.;negative
I get that they are good for you == but sheik, flavor lasts less than 60 seconds.;negative
Not intended for the southern, American palate.  YUCK!!!  Very nice tin, though.;negative
not very good won't be buying this again;negative
This is really dark coffee for me.  Even with cream I could not drink it.  My husband make Ice Coffee and that worked a little better.  I will not be buying this again!;negative
This meat is very stinky and has an odd flavor. The meat itself looks fresh and like real meat w/ meat grains and everything. I just personally couldn't get past the horrific smell.;negative
Three times I've ordered and all three times they arrived moldy. Will not order again.;negative
"Disgusting.
Chemical flavor.
Untouched at a party.
Total waste of effort, resources, and popcorn.
Do not buy this.";negative
These tomatoes are good.  That's why I've subscribed to them for about a year.  What I DON'T understand is how the price jumped from $8.22 last month to $20.41 this month!!!  Goodbye, subscription!;negative
Tastes good, but greatly upsets my stomach.;negative
I bought 2 cans for $13 something in 2013. Now, it's $19.99 a can???? Outrageous price increased!!!;negative
There is not enough chocolate or almond flavor in this cup. There's not even enough coffee flavor either, even when prepared on the 5.5oz setting.;negative
Sometimes delicious. Last time, tasteless. Not crisp either.;negative
I prefer the reg. stevia pkts. from this company as opposed to the liquid flavors.  had a funky taste to it.;negative
"I decided to try this mix (for a change), to make Guacamole and did not like the taste at all !!
From now on I will stick  to what I've been using and not try any thing new.";negative
Have yet to make a serving that didn't burn;negative
Very disappointing.  Not pleasant to drink either hot or cold.  Will not buy again.  Do not recommend.  Many other wonderful options for herbal tea.  This is not a good choice.;negative
Meh! I'm back to my PG Tips. I thought I would give it a try but found it had no taste.;negative
I thought it was dry roasted.  These nuts are roasted in unhealthy cotton seed oil.  Sorry I got them.;negative
This is the worst rice I have used thus far. It reminds me of uncle bens rice in the box. I use this now to feed my dog.;negative
This brand is one of the best made but....  Tropical flavor tastes like soap to me.  I tried it a few time over the past few weeks.  And I just can't get past the flavor.  I'll never buy this flavor again.;negative
at first i thought they were frozen but they are stale and hard as a rock. I nearly broke a tooth last night.;negative
Unbelievably salty.  Underlying flavor is good but so much salt you can barely taste anything else.;negative
Tastes like medicine.tastes like cheap chocolate.;negative
I love this product, but after accidentally purchasing this, i realized this was only a 1.75lb can. At $15 its a horrible deal. I usually buy the 3+lb can for $14;negative
These were the worst dates I ever purchased, small and dry. The fakespot-dot-com gives a C grade for this product. I bought one other product from the same company, and it was very low quality too.;negative
I wouldn't flavor dog food with this garbage.  It's a cross between my spice rack and the underside of the rim of my toilet.;negative
I picked the wrong flavor.  Not as good as some others.;negative
this was the worst fruit cake on the planet;negative
Too sweet ! i wonder if it is pure 100% ! i did not like it at all . I was mislead by the 5 stars reviews .;negative
If you just want fruit and or can't afford the high cost of fresh fruit this is ok. It's packed with large size pieces of fruit.;negative
These pickles are inedible.  They taste like the plastic packaging has leached into the pickle which can't be healthy.  Do not buy these.;negative
Product arrived opened and not qualified for returns.  Total waste of money.;negative
Dreamfields has been busted for being a fraud. Google it. I'm so angry. If you are paleo, don't buy this.;negative
"These are completely changed. After the initial extra sour taste wears off you are left with a whole lemon drop that has no flavor whatsoever.
I won't be buying these again.";negative
didn't like this noodle.. cooked it they way directions said and was fine except the sauce doesn't cling to the noodle so taste like eating slimy worms;negative
Junk.  The cutters are cute and useful.  The gingerbread mix was absolute junk.  I had to make my own dough to make these cookies.;negative
We are discarding what we bougt has some perservaties not good ,not satisfied with the health of the product taste great though;negative
Damn it Amazon keeps tricking me into buying these sugary fruit lumps. Resist the temptation! They are bad!;negative
The hot chocolate wasn't sweet enough. I made a mocha with it and threw the rest of the can away.;negative
We love pickles, but these have a really weird taste to them.  Ick!  Thought they would be a fun novelty, but I regret wasting my money on them.;negative
extremely impossible to open with arthritis.  also, very few carrot pieces;negative
Overhyped, awful tasting mess of a product.  I was gullible in buying this and warn others to stay away from the sales pitch.;negative
These are probably really healthy for you, but that's the only good thing I can say about them. the taste is not horrible, but not great, either.;negative
I was disappointed in these and ended up not eating them because they tasted stale.  I hate to post a critical review, but I'm just being honest.  Another person might like the taste.  I just didn't.;negative
Does Not taste like Any Cream soda that i ever had before my guess would be that it tastes like something you would put in your coffee;negative
It initially tastes like furniture polish and it doesn't get any better.;negative
damaged bottle, leaked and made a mess in box;negative
This is a one-serving container.  It's miss-leading... It's large because you mix all ingredients in the container.  I prefer Bob's Red Mill pancake mix.;negative
Very runny Honey. Not at all like other Raw Honey's I have used before. Raw unheated Honey is waxlike., Hard to dig out with a spoon. This pours. Even after keeping in the Fridge overnight.;negative
There is an aftertaste of marshmallow, but I can't get over the gritty texture.;negative
Very, very bland. I like horseradish that makes my nose burn when it barely touches my tongue. This doesn't even have a vague kick to it. Not how horseradish should be. Way too bland.;negative
Product is great, BUT 8 of the 12 cans arrived badly dented. The outer package wat totally intact, so they may have been dented before shipping? They come on a little 12 can shrink wrapped box.;negative
Too many carbs, there are lower carbs than this online.;negative
I don't know why I thought I wanted to get healthy and try this stuff...There is no substitute for real chocolate.;negative
"The first ingredient is Sugar, the second ingredient is SALT....what ?  The descriptions says ""unseasoned"".  Oh, and this item is UNRETURNABLE.....They should at least tell the buyer the ingredients first.";negative
Taste is obviously subjective, but this coffee has a little too much of a unique flavor for my liking.;negative
"cannot get consistent quality; hard as a rock or mushy--in the same box!";negative
The K-pod is no good for tea as there is no steeping time.  Great service from Amazon.;negative
Expected these to be good. However, these aren't the best peanut butter + chocolate combo out there.;negative
"Tastes good but hard to get our of the little pouches. Good portion control tho.
Prob won't buy again- annoying to get out.";negative
ok my dads bday flowers just arrived and ill show you what they look like : old yellow rotten most of it;negative
this i bought in january 2015 and what came expired in march 2015, will NOT buy this again;negative
The products is high quality and arrived as scheduled... I just personally don't like his seeds. They turn to gel if put in smoothies and are too small to munch. Just for me impractical.;negative
this is good but the price paid was way too high for this item if someone asked me it would tell them not to purchase anything from person.;negative
This is horrid coffee and Amazon won't stop scheduling shipment!!  Most coffee cups arrived unsealed and coffee had a strange smell and flavor.;negative
Waste of money. Mealy and barely any juicy fruit on it.;negative
great jerky, but the raised their prices by almost double.  now I buy People's Choice.;negative
Pop rocks with a hickory flavor...and an odd aftertaste;negative
The product is good. No complaints. I give it just one star because I found the same item at Sam's club for half the price at Amazon.;negative
"UPDATE :
Was given a replacement of product that was damaged upon arrival. That was very important. Just a quick resolution and problem free. Thank you.";negative
0 stars! There were bugs in the bag! I would've returned it but it was after I opened it that I noticed. I'm appalled and disgusted. Never buying again. (User's wife);negative
Don't waste your money. Buy or make your own almond milk without any weird ingredients. I would return but I've already opened one bottle.;negative
Very disappointed in this.  It tasted old and was like chewing cardboard.;negative
Too sweet for me.  Wraps well,  very strong for making a tight wrap. Texture? Unsettling.;negative
Good product.  Not very much of it for the price.;negative
I must have gotten a bad box because this box of bars tastes so dried out with no taste of any flavor whatsoeverr! I emailed the seller, no response yet. So disappointing as I love this particular bar! a lot!;negative
when they say soft, they mean hard....;negative
Way too much trouble for a single size. Night as well just buy the disposable cups!;negative
too hot damn it, i got sick  it was too hot;negative
This was much spicier than expected & the texture is like water. Disappointing.;negative
DO NOT BUY THIS RICE!!!!  Shortly after buying it, and after consuming some of the rice, I opened the bag to find worms crawling up the side of the bag and live moths flying around.  TOTALLY DISGUSTING!!!!;negative
Avid jasmine tea drinker. Not good at all taste old.;negative
I love yacon syrup to substitute molasses, maple syrup in Paleo recipes but do not like the plastic container it comes in.;negative
Good chocolate, but Tooo expensive to buy here!;negative
Not a fan of these mints.  They are not buttery soft melt in your mouth mints.;negative
Wow - per the reviews I was looking for a stronger taste of Southern Pecan.  Did not like and will not purchase again.;negative
This coffee tastes bitter to me.  My wife likes it ok.;negative
"The ""diet"" aspect makes this less than yummy";negative
I drink brewed Chaga tea everyday so I thought I'd try the teabags for the occasional convenience, but after steeping it for hours it still had no flavor.;negative
I found this weak and bitter. I am a pretty significant tea drinker and can only mix this with other teas to make it drinkable. Their Ceylon Tea is much better.;negative
Taste burnt, not fresh after a week, and seems bland even when first opened.;negative
I just didn't care for the favor or texture of these. I'll have to keep shopping for the perfect gluten free pancake.;negative
"I would strongly suggest that you do NOT USE THIS PRODUCT>
It contains Splenda, a dangerous artificial sweetener that has numerous side effects.
Just google it and trust me, you will stay away!";negative
"Expected a different product...American ""English toffee"" is different...gave this away...";negative
"Horrible taste!!
Not even close to tasting like pickles.
Bad stuff!";negative

Son won't drink them unfortunately.;negative
Tasted sour from the start and we love dried beef. his is not hat good;negative
Not a fan at all. I thought it was gross, nothing like what you get in restaurants.;negative
some just come apart and seem they are old..;negative
I like coconut water but this flavor was awful.  I was really disappointed.  It was cloying on the palette.  We will not be purchasing this again.;negative
Absolutely awful! Tasted like battery acid. Im a huge fan of Regular death wish, so I thought Id try this. Ended up throwing the entire bag away after 2 uses.;negative
Too weak and overly sweet. Not much cinnamon.;negative
cookies clumped/melted together//taste ok but had to break each one apart to eat it;negative
I did not like the taste at all. Taste very flat, like you are chewing on a piece bamboo. Would not recommend unless you are a panda;negative
Terrible Cacao, nearly unable to be eaten. Quality of the powder has diminished recently.;negative
Ick. Ick. Ick.  Don't buy this product.  It tastes horrible!  There is absolutely no taste of coconut or macadamia.  It takes like wet socks.  Waste of money.;negative
The 5 lbs of walnuts bag was sprite wide open;negative
As I'm pouring the salt into my grinder, I find a metal spring in my mix of salt. Does not make me feel that this is safe. Return window is closed but makes me want to throw the whole bag away.;negative
Arrived melted as one big blob.  They are small kit kats unwrapped thrown in the bag.  When they heat up during shipping, the chocolate melts and they all stick together - bad idea.;negative
Just personal taste...loved one of the other flavors tho.;negative
Nothing compares with fresh picked elderflowers but I was willing to try the dried version. Not flavourfull at all, money wested!! NOT recomended!!;negative
BEWARE! ITS NOT 100% Adzuki Bean!  Seller lied! It also contains SOYBEANS! and made in CHINA! What a garbage!!!!;negative
Half of them were stale, even w/good expiration date;negative
Taste Horrible, Just get the Regular Steaz with the sugar, The Artificial sugar does not go well with this green tra.;negative
May be organic, in which case it's a lot better than the nonorganic, irradiated herbs.  BUT... there's very little discernible dill flavor with this dried dill.  Actually, almost no dill flavor, at all.;negative
Nothing special. The flavor is bland and the freshness is about what you'd get in a grocery store. I expected a good vanilla and salty flavor. This product doesn't deliver. I wouldn't buy it again.;negative
it doesnt work don't waste your money.....no calming effect to me ... it has a great flavor.. wish it worked;negative
I drink all types of teas, but this is one of the worst tasting teas, in my opinion.;negative
Received 2 damaged jars of Nutella that were also way past the expiration date of FEB 2015.;negative
"Oops. When I opened the package to use it, there was mold on it.

Enough said. I won't be ordering this again.";negative
The picture looks great but unfortunately the reality is that this tower is not as nice as the pictur.  It is smaller.  I would not order it again.;negative
"I wanted to try different kind of cereal other than my usual pick, so I decided to purchase this one.
Unfortunately, this was not the best cereal that I chose.
I won't buy this again...";negative
It is STILL sugar, even if it is juice. Ask your doctor, this stuff will give you diabetes as easily as soda will. For health, drink WATER!;negative
My kids didn't like the texture of this oatmeal, it's very hard and not quick cook that's for sure;negative
Grainy, bit of a weird aftertaste. Not bad if you're doing a hard keto diet and happen to be desperate for a bowl of cereal. One serving and you'll be over it!;negative
I did not like the flavor of this stevia.  This tasted processed.;negative
Mediocre at best. None of the olives were firm enough to make olive bread.;negative
A mild coffee , other than that it's ok.;negative
I chose not to use this product since it arrived in the heat and is packaged in a plastic bottle.  As we all know, heated plastic is very toxic for humin consumption.;negative
"The ""natural"" flavors cause me to feel tired.";negative
not as good as i thought it would be;negative
I don't know why, but I bought 4 boxes of this thinking it sounded good.  But it's not.  Makes rubbery pancakes that don't taste good at all.;negative
"I didn't care for this brand. I bought it so I wouldn't have to carry around a baggie of xylitol. It does not taste good at all. It's not 100% xylitol. The ingredients label says ""xylitol and silica"".";negative
I was not I pressed with this coffee. The flavors were just not there. Pretty much just regular coffee. Will not buy again.;negative
Candy old and most of the wrappers in big bold letters read: Made in China;negative
This coffee arrived with an expiration date less than one month beyond the date received.  I do not feel I should be paying a premium price for organic coffee that is nearly beyond its shelf life.;negative
This was the most disgusting pasta! It has a very bad taste that I trashed the whole pot of pasta that I made! I am not a picky eater either!;negative
Taste awful and is weak. I'll be sticking to Swiss Maid in the envelopes from now on.;negative
Amazon substituted this for the Mangosteen superfruit tea, which was good.  It is similar but has so much stevia that the sweetness is overwhelming, making it essentially undrinkable.;negative
"Gum is healthy and tastes great in the first minute; after that, there is no taste.  For the price, I would prefer gum with more long-lasting flavor.";negative
Gimbal's Licorice Scottie Dogs, 11.5 oz;negative
I don't even want to give this one star.;negative
Feature of this salt What? You do not feel the difference between common salt.;negative
Received the sealed package yet the candies are hard and brittle - unlike any Mentos I've ever had.  Very disappointed.  Glad it was so cheap.;negative
The only good thing about this is there was no dispute when I contacted the company about how bad this is.;negative
I didn't care for the flavor.  The price was good.  I will not purchase this brand again.;negative
Generally French Burnt Peanuts are great but these arrived very stale, even the freezer couldn't bring the crunch back. Won't order again. Waste of money for so much product.;negative
I suffer with hydration because of my diabetes and drank a lot of this water, which in turn caused my feet to swell because of the excess amount of magnesium.;negative
Not very good. Very granular and strong flavours.;negative
dont know what they changed in their ingredients but it had everyone in the house running to the bathroom.;negative
As I said before all favors tasted alike ,walnut had half a nut only.  To sweet  no butter no salt.  Not old fashion either.  But marshmallow type. Over priced for why you'd getting;negative
This does not do well in cookie or cake recipes. Threw it away.;negative
Terrible ! Crumbles apart and the taste is just terrible !!!;negative
These were disappointing.  The peanuts were stale and the chocolate had no flavor.;negative
HELP! I ordered coconut enzimes, but recieved Solid black silicon auto darkening tan technology#;negative
Don't use this for egg salad!! I had to throw the whole batch out...it tastes rancid! Recommend trying avacodo paleo mayo or making your own;negative
The mustard pretzels are horrible.  The rest of the box is okay.  I through all of the mustard pretzels in the trash.;negative
2 to 3 times smaller then radish bunch of radish bought in store. Tiny heads that weight nothing;negative
Watery results, does not fit so well in Rancilio Silvia with OEM pod adapter.  I purchased the Baronet pods and they are much better.;negative
Purchased pack of 12 and my household has used three cans.  I do not know if those cans were dented.  Of the nine remaining EIGHT CANS ARE DENTED.  I will not reorder.;negative
Don't waste your money, none if the bread would rise.;negative
I bought this cuz the reviews raved.  It doesn't taste any different from anything else, in fact my husband thinks it tastes more like tap water than our tap water.  If I could get my money back I would.;negative
this is a great snack we love popping it thank you;negative
It's good however I recived the coffee bag with small slash from the side;negative
I drink Luzianne tea 3 meals a day!  and watching for the sale cycles at the grocer was not working for me.  ordering a case will last several months, maybe a year, FRESH and not spend gas money!;negative
The coffee taste very bitter and a pack is way too much for a solofil cup leaving me to measure out half a packet for each cup of coffee that I need and having to leave the packet half full for the next cup.;negative
Plastic taste to them.  Shipped fast though.;negative
Didn't get the amount offered or all the flavors. Honestly the only thing I liked was the pouch they came in, makes a good change purse;negative
Do not taste like the regular Jelly Bellies.;negative
These peanuts were pretty hard, was afraid I'd break a tooth.  Also, not much of the toffee flavor I'd been expecting.  Wish I had tried the pecans instead.;negative
Not enough salt and a strange and unlikable variety.  Never again.;negative
It isn't anything like what is promised. It's kind of water and a little bit bitter. Back to Trader Joe's soy creamer for me.;negative
This ramen normally doesn't make me sick but this particular shipment did, find another seller perhaps.;negative
THE TASTE IS GREAT.  VERY YUMMY. --- BUT ---- THE PRICE IS TO EXPENSIVE, TO MUCH MONEY $$$.  THEY NEED TO LOWER THEIR PRICES.;negative
don't like these much, but love the garlic rice ones;negative
the chocolate flavor doesn't come through as much as I would have liked;negative
Wasn't a fan. It tasted stale and seems to be a very light/medium coffee with minimal flavor. Its just not bold enough for me.;negative
If you love black licorice do not buy this. It's mostly a sugar coated candy around a small amount of licorice. If you don't care about the licorice...it's a sweet treat for you then.;negative
Horrible product. Does not perform as expected. Waste of money, went to the trash can.;negative
Arrived in an unsealed plastic container, very little aroma  (which could be a blessing but indicates lack of freshness). It  has wheat in  it (Ishould have read the very small print. );negative
"ARRIVED ""OUT OF DATE"" cant be returned";negative
There is not a single hole pretzel in the entire Barrel. They are all broken up into tiny pieces and crumbs at the bottom. Do not buy the;negative
Really love Kind bars, however this FLAVOR, off point...... Not a bit of P.B.taste........WOULD NOT RECCOMEND, or buy again !!!!;negative

Get rid of that unnecessary and unhealthy fructose loaded sugar garbage and you have a nice tasty balanced bar.";negative
Bell pepper arrived with wilted, mushy skin. Not fresh, had to call for a refund.;negative

I bought this product because of the stellar reviews, but was very disappointed in the taste and texture of the snacks.;negative
It's good at first flavor and then tastes like perfume smells.  This was the experience both my husband and i had.;negative
WAY too salty...250mg sodium per 1/4 t...little 'shroom flavor.;negative
I have not found any flavor that I just love. They are too strong for me, so I cut the pods and just use half of one in my single cup maker.;negative
I was so looking forward to this but I'm greatly disappointed.  I have to use twelve drops of this and four drops of the regular stuff in order to get a vague chocolate presence. So so sad!!;negative
Came with mold on one side and a terrible smell.;negative
Too much sage and too sweet for me.;negative
"I wouldn't buy a sampler pack like this again because there were too many of the cups we knew we would not enjoy; so there was quite a few we felt were wasted and that made these cost prohibitive.";negative
OK, I like Ritz crackers and liked the idea of less salt on them.  These, however, taste like cardboard...  I tossed all of them in the garbage.;negative
These have a strange chemical taste and left me feeling sick to my stomach. Not at all like the Boba shops. They never get really soft even after doubling the cook time;negative
I gave these as a gift and I was very embarrassed to find out that the expiration date was long before I ever gave them out.;negative
I did not like the flavor and won't purchase again.;negative
Uhg !, so salty tasting. from the reviews I was expecting much better quality taste. I do Not recommend this.;negative
honestly would have been delicious (have had this elsewhere) but the batch we got was so stale.;negative
The taste of coffee was disappointing. I will not order this brand again.;negative
This paprika is just as tasteless as the bottled stuff in the grocery store. It's not worth the extra money just to add a red color to your food.;negative
god the smell of this thing honestly stay away;negative
returned when I noticed it was not made in usa.  Great service by Amazon!;negative
more like a bar of fudge than a brownie. Also, they taste stale.;negative
The Mexican coffee I really enjoyed, the Ethiopian however seems weak and much less flavorful.  Not a coffee I'd repurchase.;negative
I don't know what the hype is about with these. Didn't taste like anything special. Tasted very chalky.;negative
Nothing really wrong with the proiduct.  Just don't care for the taste.;negative
I really want to like these.  Such interesting flavors.  But alas it was just nasty.;negative
"The cap of the bottle is broken and the honey has leaked onto the carton
Request it be replaced on an urgent basis and oblige
Shabbir shaikh";negative
Very artificial taste.  I have had several people try it and only one person liked it.  Watered down flavor even on 6 oz setting.;negative
I bought this tea because I love a warm cup of tea and love the taste of cherries. This tea has a slight aroma of cherry but does not taste like cherry. I really like Harney & Sons tea but this is a no.;negative
it taste like regular store brand tuna. it's not bad, its just to expensive;negative
TRIED REAL HARD TO SAVE THEM BUT SOMEHOW THEY ALL JUST DIED OFF ONE BY ONE. BUMMER! WON'T BE GETTING ANY MORE.;negative
The bars have a decent flavor, but  are much too hard.;negative
OMG...THIS IS SO TERRIBLE!! FAINT TASTE OF CHEESE WHEN YOU FIRST PUT IT IN YOUR MOUTH, BUT THE MORE YOU CHEW THE MORE IT TASTES LIKE CARDBOARD.;negative
These are the awfulest tasting things I have ever eaten, I even wrote to the person who makes these and just got jumped all over for not liking them, Ive never had anyone treat me that bad over a product.;negative
"AWFUL---ya--tiny is right--but they admit that on the bag--taste like cardboard---and very dry taste--Cant believe they got a deal on the ""Tank""--but--good luck to them---Pop Secret MUCH better and cheaper";negative
Ugh. Don't buy this. It's like unflavored gumdrops and doesn't taste the least bit like kiwi---or anything else. It's just sweet.;negative
Taste?  POOR!  Very weak, even when using two of these in a standard 8 oz cup of coffee.  Other flavors from International Delight taste far better.  I'll never purchase this particular item again!;negative
This package is super small. The gum is not chewable.;negative
"wow tiny and not that good; cardboard taste and wayyyy too expensive for what you get.....";negative
Ok but definitely not worth the price!;negative
Ok nutritionally.  Great that they are vegan, but the taste leaves a yucky, chemical like after taste.;negative
This was too salty to put on my already salted microwave popcorn, which is why I bought it.;negative
Insipid! Bah! I don't like the texture of it! ;negative
I have only tried this with my rice cooker. I don't like the resulting taste at all. It tastes and smells like the yeast extract. I will try it in a soup base and update my review if I get a better result.;negative
expected something great...had to use lots more than truvia type products or splenda type sweeteners...way to much money for this!!!;negative
"Thank You Ever So Much
Just a Pleasure Doing Business With You..
Will be Back to Reorder Real Soon or maybe not
Just Me..";negative
Very small portions, taste is not good, macaroni turns to paste even though I followed directions exactly as given.;negative
The packaging looks dusty, generic, and like seconds. The candy is not chewy but is, instead, old and dried. Pass;negative
Ugh.  I've tried it again and again hoping it would grow on me, but it is sickeningly sweet.  It gets worse as you drink on as move flavoring settles to the bottom.  Really gross.;negative
I prefer the crunchy version....without the crunchy bits it tastes kind of bland...I crushed some whole cashews and mixed them in and transformed it into yummy crunchy cashew butter...;negative
I ordered a lot of stacking boxes of goodies this year. I have received complaints from every recipient. Never again.;negative
I typically enjoy frozen processed food, but this was horrendous.  The filling looks nothing like the picture on the package and the flavor its likely similar to what I feed my dog.;negative
I didn't like the taste once I mixed it with my coffee. Perhaps I'm just too accustomed to either dairy or soymilk in my beverages but I couldn't get used to the flavor.;negative
Not my taste in coffee. But my hubby thinks it's ok. It reminds me of Maxwell House in that I can't drink more than one cup without getting a stomach ache!;negative
Meh--not a fan. I thought the pack was way over-priced for what you get. I didn't realize they are very small packages so beware. The flavor was okay but nothing outstanding.;negative
These were terrible. They just tasted like chemicals. Very disappointing.;negative
Others may like this product but as far as me, I did not.  They were gooey and very little taste. I mixed it with chicken broth and still to no avail.;negative
many of these almonds were bitter or rancid and all of them had a powdery coating on the surface. the powder could be washed off but this did not make for the easy snacking that I was hoping for.;negative
I gave these to a canned food drive. I am fortunate to get really good salmon on a regular basis. I was hoping these would be a good quick snack. Might be for some, just not me.;negative
"i wasn't too impressed about this product.  this is my first time trying Krusteaz.  was looking for the ""old fashioned"" taste of pancakes.  this was not it!!!  i will not order again.";negative
This has a Gritty texture that higher quality products don't seem to have. I'll stick with the more expensive brand I typically buy. Not bad but not great either;negative
I had clicked on the salt free and got this instead.;negative
Not very good. Was DISSAPOINTED in taste and quality of this syrup;negative
I requested sugar-free but didn't receive sugar-free.;negative
I keep forgetting that I don't like these and made the mistake of purchasing them again. I love love love the powder version but the single serve in my opinion tastes like pesticide.;negative
I bought the 2lb whole bean decaf twice. The second time it smelled and tasted STALE. Maybe it wasn't packaged very well or it wasn't stored properly but I don't think I will buy it again.;negative
I thought these were tasteless and the texture just wasn't palatable to me. I gave them to my daughter who didn't like them either and she gave them to my son who also didn't like them.;negative
Arrived melted, product was broken into and all over the place, had to throw out;negative
As USUAL totally CANDIED JERKY...More of a DESSERT than a Meat Product. This is so disappointing that I have to make my own as the ONLY way to find JERKY that is not 50% SUGAR!;negative
NOT AS DEPICTED.  8 OF THE 12 BLOOMS WERE A CHEAP CALENDULA, ONLY ONE WAS OF THE FABULOUS BLOOM SHOWN.  THEY HAD ABSOLUTELY NO CONCERN WITH MAKING AMENDS.;negative
Was stake even though the package was not expired.really don't know why. Bought next batch from Nesspresso and what a difference in the aroma and taste.;negative
Underwhelming to say the least. Has no hazelnut flavor and tastes like boiled sawdust.;negative
I ordered DECAFFIENATED Chai Tea and received regular Chai Tea. Basic error ~ shouldn't happen. TOTAL FAIL ~ I'd give a ZERO if I could;negative
thought this would be as good as Folger's ground coffee.  Not;negative
Twelve dollars for a jar of spaghetti sauce. The pic shows three.  Read descriptions carefully. No help contacting the warehouse. Feel very taken.;negative
"very dry and not tasty! Would never order again!
Gave it a try as I have ordered directly from the smokehouse and the rib eyes were NO better ! What is happening to the beef(Monsanto maybe????)";negative
More sugary than licorice flavor in my opinion. Not worth the big price to me.;negative
"Dont eat this!  Buy Teddy brand instead!

Look at the ingredients!  YuK!

Complain and demand manufactures use better/less crap in their peanut butter!!";negative
I guess I should have tried a bottle locally before buying a case. The consistency and flavor were awful. Not sure if this is what they all taste like but I will stick to my drink packets...;negative
Uses too much sugar.  Meat turns out sweet.  Ugh.;negative
Do not buy these. They are so old and stale that when you open each mini candy bar they actually stank.;negative
Absolutely as hard as a rock, old, stale, and tasteless. I cannot recommend this seller and will not be making future purchases from them.;negative
My granddaughter refused to eat these. Theres nothing wrong with them but she just did not care for the flavor;negative
I do not like that almost all the items in the box were expired. Even the top of the box says best by Oct 4. I received my purchase today...Oct 6.;negative
Not good! Almost chalky. Not what I expected;negative
I didn't know it would have a citrus flavor included;negative
Do not east more than one at a time. It will destroy your insides. Tastes very good but you will regret when you live in the bathroom for a while.;negative
Even when mixed with alcohol it does not form a pretty paint for foods. Very dull color too.;negative
Does not taste like sweet potato at all.  The taste is forgettable too.;negative
Not good, not green, very dark, no energy waste of my time and money;negative
Horrible taste does not match people reviews;negative
"Way overpriced!

Not much better than regular Turkish delight that costs $5 or so (currently this product is sold for $21).";negative
we had wanted sugar free, this is not;negative
Awful stuff...must be an acquired taste....;negative
I was very disappointed with this item! Will not buy again! Not fresh!;negative
It's in Japanese, I don't know how much water to add.;negative
This does not taste like pure cinnamon,  it does not dissolve well,  and does not taste good.  I won't waste my money again. I'm going to use it as an ant repellent and hope it at least works for that.;negative
I was sent 3 boxes of hot peppered crab chips- not what I previously ordered also not labeled as the peppered variety, otherwise I wouldn't have ordered them- Amazon was kind enough to refund my $;negative
If you want your coffee to taste like gas station coffee, buy this. If you want your coffee to be creamy, buy something else. I normally get mini moos. I'll stick to that in the future.;negative
Horrible aftertaste.  I was really looking forward to receiving both this flavor and the Orange Mango.  Returning both flavors.;negative
Must have changed their recipe, which is what I feared when the price went down. Not as chocolately, and texture is different.;negative
I tried to like this, but gave it away.  Very potent tea.;negative
Way overpriced . I expected this candy corn to be far superior to the cheaper brands . But they taste exactly the same so I paid 3 times what I should have paid .;negative
Chocolates received broken in small pieces. They have almost no chocolate smell or taste, and they are covered with a whitish coating.;negative
"The taste was just ok. but the gritty texture makes it a no more purchase for me.

Not sure what I'm gonna do with 5 other tins as I don't own a dog.";negative
Very small jar.  My fault for not realizing it.;negative
Has a chemical aftertaste, we tried a few pieces and Ultimately threw it all out because of the aftertaste.. cant be healthy....;negative
I was expecting a liquid oil vs solid. The solid has to reach 79 degrees to liquify making it inconvenient to use;negative
"This doesn't have any jelly.

I'd like a refund please";negative
Arrived unsealed... Anyone else's come this way?;negative
I like the taste and add them to my low carb recipes but after I bought here I found them at Walmart for $3 a bag ugh;negative
Huge dent in side of can.  Very disappointing;negative
The price (using Subscribe and Save) is right, but this looks and tastes different from any chili powder I have used.  I usually love Simple Organic, but this was not for me.;negative
Not creamy at all, disappointing. Wish I could return.;negative
Thought I would give these a try. No taste, and not fun to choose. But then that's just me. I threw them away;negative
We tried it but it just isn't really a good replacement for regular bread in our view.;negative
I like bare fruit's other apple chips but these were just too tart for me, and I imagine it's logical since it is dehydrated Granny Smith but they are really acidic so I will stick to the Fuji version.;negative
Too many cheaters coconut flavor but ok. There are better brands.;negative
I hate to knock a company that tries to provide a good value, especially with 'water processed' decaf, but these beans smell and taste like dirt and old matchsticks - funny how many good reviews there are....;negative
No filberts. No pecans. And a few pistachios. 3 cans and2 filberts 4 walnuts and no pecans. Boo!;negative
"Disappointment... always have been pleased with the ""Eight O'clock"" brand but the decaf just didn't have the ""flavor""";negative
No outer seal. Cap loose. Inner seal completely loose. Not much aroma. Not real happy.;negative
Had to return, did not see list of ingredients but when arrived I knew immediately it was not something I could try.  Sorry, love the chai and green leaf ones though :);negative
The tea was highly rated so I decided to try it. For me it was very mild and I needed to use more than the normal one teaspoon. I have been adding some of it to my other teas which has worked out.;negative
Turns out my daughter and I are allergic to xanthan gum. Of all other things to use, not sure why that's always the go to ingredient;negative
"They USED to be what they advertised: ""Bursting with flavor."" No more.";negative
Too many nuts - this family was spitting the nuts out.  Package arrived and the fudge was HARD not soft like I previously remember.  Not buying this particular fudge again.  Sorry folks.;negative
I should have read the negative reviews, not tasty, not yummy, I agree with all the negative reviews.;negative
It tastes like hot chocolate,  not a latte. Very disappointed.  The price is ridiculous.;negative
Just got these in March,  2016. Product expired in April, 2004. Coffee cake anyone????;negative
There is so much cinnamon in these I can't take it.;negative
Um I just want to say these were not what I was looking for. They are not gummies, they're more like marshmallows. So be aware of that if you're looking for gummies.;negative
The product I recieved was not even remotely close to a Hershey's nugget, was sketchy and completely unusable. Huge waste. Buyer beware.;negative
Taste like garbage should not be able to call this swill cola most fowel tasting swill i have ever tried;negative
Love these crackers but this box is stale. Crackers crumble as soon as u take a bite.;negative

Somehow this chicken tasted really bad.;negative
Not too happy with this purchase. Like sweetened cowhide. Maybe I'm missing something.;negative
Had very little taste, did not like;negative
Not sweet enough, and it doesnt desolve well.;negative
Only 4 apples were good from this batch. My bananas were better this time though!;negative
Not very tasty, even tried it with coffee, but it still has this sweet watered down taste I am not fond of. it is more sweet then anything sweet water tasting tea mix. NOT LIKING IT AT ALL;negative
I tried this in the morning instead of my morning coffee and it gave me the shakes bad!!!! It must be very high in Caffine, not for me, I did not like the effects at all. The taste was good.;negative

Not too impressed by this popcorn. Corn was way too dry. I had a lot of corn that did not pop. And also very expensive. I will look at other brands.;negative
Definitely not gingerbread, couldn't give it away once someone drank it. Definitely off the mark.;negative
Yuk. I tried many hint flavors, and I just don't like it. They taste bitter to me. My husband says they are okay. I think they are too pricey.;negative
$10.00 for a little bag ? and a couple of fire hot beans in there makes me want to never buy jellies again;negative

They nicely packaged for keeping fresh. I just didn't like the taste. Gave them to my neighbor.";negative
Did not like them. These did not fill my quest for low carb foods.;negative
like another reviewr, these were outstanding with past orders but this bag is so packed with pieces, powder & waste. looking for new sourse;negative
It smelled like dog food and could not tell the difference between this or the Keystone pork that I bought also sorry.;negative
It beats having to add milk and butter but the flavor is so so. Won't buy again.;negative
This color is not very vivid.  For a gel, I do not recommend.;negative
These were stale. I heated them up in the microwave to make them edible. Otherwise, they literally will break your teeth to chew.;negative
Nothing good to say about this product. Taste terrible & gave me an upset stomach.;negative

I bought this as a birthday gift and found out it  was expired and pass the expiration date!!!  How embarrassing!!! You shouldnt be selling expired good!!!;negative

my kids hated these.  what more can I say?;negative
Not like before, I barely fillled a 1/2 teaspoon measuring with the beef that was in there?;negative

WAY too much salt..!!  Will not order again from this seller.;negative
Stay away from this flavor and there tortilla chips they are gross;negative
I bought this to help with some congestion issues I had. It had such a high sugar content, I could barely drink it. Honestly, I don't think it really needed any sugar at all.;negative
i did not like it. if you add milk it turns into a mush, and it has too much cinnoman;negative
This was bitter and the texture was awful. If you are expecting a Nutella like experience, you can forget that. I eat low carb, and this substitute simply isn't worth it.;negative
Tastes good but big pieces of gristle.;negative
"When you were a kid, you may have LOVED mayo, but not anymore. Hated Brussel Sprouts, now kind of like them. Beer as a kid?
All I'm saying, you get used to the taste.";negative
Description says 400 grams.  40 grams was received.  Package received does look like the picture but only 40 grams.  Would have ordered from another vendor had amount been given correctly;negative
These taste old and stale, even the texture is bad;negative
I was hoping for a dill chip similar to Ideal Protein dill zippers.  This product does have great dill flavor, but the actual chip tastes like compressed sawdust.  Really awful.  I'm very disappointed.;negative
I was disappointed in these K-cups.  Maybe I expected too much, but I did not like the taste of these.;negative
Followed the instructions exactly and used grass fed milk. Ended up with curdled, spoiled milk. Tried again. Same outcome. ;negative
I was hoping for something more refreshing, but they had a bit of a plastic/chemical taste.;negative
"mix was OK but had a funny taste to it.
Not a very well balanced mix.  Lots of kiwi and pineapple chunks, not much else.
Will not buy again... disappointed.";negative
Too hot for my taste, though I understand many will disagree. I just prefer more flavor and less heat. If you are OK with hots of heat, try it as most seem to like or love it.;negative
"Ridiculous pricing! I should have returned.
Costco (where I first saw these), sells you 4 times as many for same price.";negative
They give a weird taste to my smoothies and on top of that they spell horrendous.  I'll be skipping this super food :)  I'm not even sure I can finish the bag.;negative
Really wanted to like these but yuck.;negative
These were stale and came with an expiration date of 12/14/17. Waste of money.;negative
Didn't seem to taste right. Also, it was very, very salty. Used one bag and returned the other nine bags thanks to Amazon.;negative
gross.daughter loves these type candies..but not this one;negative
Tough, chewy skins with squishy contents that taste hot, but not like meat.  Wish I had bought a smaller, less expensive pack to taste test first.;negative
"Did not like it at all.  Strange ""cheap"" taste to it and the aftertaste is bad.";negative
Not worth it,If you truly truly Love Dark roast Coffee.;negative
Tough consistency, and less licorice flavor than other brands I've tried.;negative
COMPLETE waste of money!! Bought 3 bags, threw them ALL away. PLEASE don't waste your money like I did??!!;negative
Couldn't continue taking it because of taste.  Plus I was doubtful of the benefits.  Wish a capsule would be made.;negative
I was not impressed with this coffee.  No plans to buy more/;negative
Cans were all dented, but not symmetrical- -odd because they were wrapped together.;negative
Here the product is in a black plastic pouch, the one I ordered came in a brown paper pouch which was ripped from the bottom and some of the contents spilled inside the package box. I don't really trust it.;negative
This isn't quite what I expected.  I thought the coconut would be a bit crispier since it said it was toasted.  I expected it to be more like the Dang products.;negative
The taste really wasn't good at all. We threw them out!;negative
maybe just me but taste is not so good;negative
Not the best tasting. Other brands are better.;negative
I didn't like this coffee. I found Cortado to be a much tastier drink. I just set the water level higher.;negative
Disappointing ginger strength, and they dissolve very quickly. Ehhhh...;negative
Not a single leaf in this bag has been rolled into a ball, vaguely tastes like gunpowder green but ain't gunpowder green;negative
The initial taste of this gum is great.  I love that it does not contain artificial sweeteners.  However, the taste fades in less than 1 minute!;negative
Not as smokey as the one I just finished, but definitely a better flavor than sea salt alone.;negative
The drink taste ok, but I was disappointed to find it had fratose corn syrup in it!  Hated to drink it them, but hated to give it away too. You decide what's best for yourself.;negative
"Lindt chocolate is a great brand name; but not for shipping; candy came very melted; even though weather was still cold.  This is a product that needs to be bought at a local store.";negative
"I don't like these!  The ""energy"" ones are great but these are not good...they are way too sweet and tastes like syrup.";negative
I did not like this AT ALL.  I  mixed it to go with  my whey protein, and it was terrible.  I tried some powdered coconut milk and that was a winner!;negative
I love sprinkles but these contain hydrogenated oils;negative
This creamer is a great idea but I think it has a Weird taste! I won't order again. I switched to another brand.;negative
Too expensive. Raisins were a bit too dried out. I will not buy again.;negative
Gross, so sour I have to choke them down a little at a time.  I have other brands of protein packs that I crave so I won't be buying these again.;negative
Bland taste. Wouldn't buy it again. Thought it was a good Concept though;negative
prefer monkfruit, a bit of bitter after taste;negative
It's just not worth the price.  The price just simply needs to come down.  Try other, stronger Starbucks brews for better, stronger flavor.;negative
I wanted to like this, I really did.  I miss caviar!  But this just isn't right.  The texture is pretty close, but it tastes bad, like some icky chemical.;negative
As expensive as these were they were stale when we received them. We always put our almonds in the fridge to keep it fresh & crunchy but they were always slightly soft & not crunchy.;negative
Not one of these seeds sprung for me. Pretty disappointed. I was hoping to set myself on fire with them.;negative
Too bad. Great idea, but bad execution. Chewy, tough wraps are tasteless and really tough to bite through. Other than that, they look pretty...lol.;negative
The bars have healthy ingredients but are too seedy,grainy for me. Maybe seeds could be ground for a smoother consistency.;negative
Kind of rubbery with an unpleasant, slightly sweet flavor.;negative
My family did not like these. WAY too sweet for us.;negative
Terrible!  I put this in something I was making, and ended up having to throw it all out because this powder ruined the taste.  Find something better than this!;negative
Buyer beware ... these are TINY cans. You are paying like $5 per can. And they look and taste like roasted red peppers to me which you can buy for about $2 for a 32 oz can.;negative
The lid came cracked. The oil is overpriced. I found an even larger jar at BJ's for $13.;negative
Terrible without any attributes above zero !!!!!!!;negative
The Futters Pistachio Butter is dry and with very little flavor.;negative
"Rather bummed. Definitely got a bad batch. Yeast did not rise and basically there went the Thanksgiving bread. :(

I think I'm going back to packets.";negative
Not a good flavor, seemed greasy and I probably would not get it again.;negative
Don't understand the rave reviews. Of course maybe they're better when not stale/half rancid. Yuck;negative
Tastes like liquid red hots. I hate red hots.;negative
Don't know what the problem is but, these could burst at the seems spewing coffee grinds all over the place, now I remember why I didn't reorder these sooner. Not good three them away!;negative
I did not like this one at all ~ I prefer the taste of their Caramel Flavor.;negative
I ordered gluten free and this does not say gluten free.  NOT what I ordered or expected.  Extremely disappointed!;negative
I live in Kona, where we have amazing low-acidity coffee. These beans are terrible tasting, please don't be fooled by the high rating! No wonder why they are so cheap!;negative
Just not to our taste - but others may find it more to theirs.;negative
These look good but had an odd taste to them. The chocolate was better than the coconut, but still not worth re-ordering for me.;negative
Although the initial taste is very good, the flavor disappears within a minute. I'll stick to the mints to get the benefits of xylitol.;negative
To me, it had a funny chemical taste. Try it yourself though.;negative
The product works well but the spray can was shipped a barely passed envelope and the lid was crushed.;negative
"Very ""thin"" tasting soda. Not a full bodied flavor at all. I will not be buying this product again. It is not what I consider a premium product.";negative
What I ordered wasn't what I received. I received another brand of blueberry bars.;negative
Very deceptive packaging. The bar is half the size of the package so one bite, or two tiny bites. Appreciate the 80 calories but that just makes you want to eat the whole box.;negative
I guess I should've read the description better. Paid a lot for a tiny bag of candy!!!! Over priced.;negative
The taste is ok, but it really upset my stomach!;negative
I wouldnt buy these again.  To many small items that they count as part of it.  The Air heads were super hard and snack size.  Bought a box for myself and for a gift.;negative
This stuff was stale.  And the packages was full of crumbs.  Buy the one at trader joes instead.  Bigger bag and better tasting.;negative
Not worth the money versus the quality and quantity.  Will not buy again.;negative
Glass and peppercorn were all over my package when it arrived. I suggest switching the container to something less fragile;negative
Doesn't taste that good. Too salty. Normal bacon tastes way better. I've tasted other bacon jerkies that were way better.;negative
"Has no taste no aroma of the honey, it feels like synthetic substance, I will never again by something that is not ""Organic"" certificated";negative
This product had a really foul taste. It smelled wonderful but it was very brown in color and tasted really bad;negative
I HATE that this product is no longer available on Subscribe & Save!!!!  Had to change brands thought I love the product!;negative
They taste good, that's a given. But these arrived broken into a hundred pieces. I haven't found an actual whole chip yet. Every container is like this too. Super disappointed :(;negative
Awful taste. This simply does not measure up to biriyani. I like South Indian food and this did not meet my expectations. There just isn't enough seasoning here to make a good biriyani.;negative
Took over a week to get this and one can had broke open and the entire package was soggy and sticky.;negative
I've eaten real carobs, this does not taste like carobs;negative
Took 18 days to deliver we received them 8/17/17 chocolate was all melted;negative
Did not look fresh. some heads of asparagus were cut off . Was very disappointing.;negative
"Bought the wrong kind, thought I was getting K cups, but did not return.  I got "" pods"" and K cups mixed up";negative
arrived half full, the rest had leaked out;negative
It's not the hash I don't like. It's the deceptive, hidden shipping cost of nearly $13.00, for six cans. Won't do that again;negative
be careful,when ordering,small pod size;negative
I wanted regular size pumpkin seeds for my guinea pigs, they will not eat them the shell is to hard so I did no even open the pack and sent them back unopend.;negative
Very very light flavor, almost hard to notice. I can't even tell much of a scent when opening the packaging....Pretty disappointed.;negative
I am not a coffee drinker but like a cup once a day.  This coffee is still too weak even for me!  Won't buy again.;negative
May have good flavor but the price is way too much for the ounce I received. Disappointed!!;negative
Wasnt happy with the taste.  Wont order this brand again.;negative
"Blah flavor; but the real problem is that it left considerable amounts of sediment in the cup.  Cup had to be rinsed after each pod.";negative
I personally did not care for the flavor or the container made it hard to pour without spilling;negative
YUCK --- no taste, no flavor, no smell of toffee whatsoever. I'm packing them up and returning them.  Try this coffee instead: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B004779XSM;negative
I got this soup hoping it would taste halfway decent.  It doesn't.  I wish I could send it all back.;negative
Not a good product at all, really left a weird aftertaste.;negative
This traveled coast to coast to get to me, by truck, in the summer heat.  By the time they got to me, they were awful.  The pieces were also broken into crumbs. It's good popcorn if you buy it fresh.;negative
Lots of very small pieces... would not purchase again;negative
Rich broth but a bland taste. The other pork flavor is better.;negative
No flavor! Tiny compared to picture!;negative
All of the cookies were crushed and not one was in a whole piece. Trashed the whole bag.;negative
Tastes like chalky water.  It's not a poor product, it's a terrible product.;negative
Was only able to consume about 1/2 cup total of product, then decided that picking out the grit in every bite was not worth it. Will not order this product again.;negative
The single items were dry by the time I got them, however, the chocolate cake was exceptional.;negative
Absolutely disgusting, I bought three of that and now don't have a clue of what to do with it;negative
Received and they were all melted, since it is summer it seems like the seller should have accounted for that. Flavor is decent when I smash it back into edible sized pieces;negative
I really wish I liked this tea more, the flavor seemed weak to me. I used the normal amount I use with my other teas, this one was just not flavorful enough for mea.;negative
It is so handy to use especiallyin a bread machine.  I don't like to knead so this makes it very easy and if I wrap it in damp paper towels and glad wrap, it stays moist for several days.;negative
these are horrible. I can't finish a whole candy. it fills your mouth with awful flavor and it makes me nauseated.;negative
Had to give it away because I hated it!;negative
Flavor's really good, but gave me digestive upset. :~(;negative
Don't know why they even call this fruit cake.  Truly weird flavor.  Took a bite and chucked it.;negative
These suck and taste awful. Don't waste your money. They are not like gummy bears. The flavor is just awful.;negative
I didn't even use that much on two occasions to spice up some canned chili, but both times it gave me the old 'Johnny quick step' a day later!;negative
This coffee had a moldy almost chemical taste to it. I don't know what causes this but it seems I can't get a good coffee bean unless I buy it local.  Maybe it's just me but this tasted awful.;negative
The size wasn't noted on this, so of course a thumble of arrowroot arrives. Never again. And thanks, because I need it, like yesterday.;negative
Not tasty at all. I was so disappointed. I think Newman's  has a better tasting licorice.;negative
"OMG! It smells like the poisonous plastic packaging.
 I feel like I would poison my whole family if I bake with this flour. I am so disgusted.
Zero star! OMG !";negative
this tastes nothing like a real cheesecake not even close to what you would buy already made. my kids like it but as for me and my husband, we won't eat it again.;negative
How is it that this product is not that HOT????  I'm stil wondering???!???;negative
Found out after reading label, it has Aspartame as an ingrediant. Not for me!;negative
Not sure when the cherries were harvested or how old the juice was when bottled but this was the second bottle that the cherry liquid has become caramelized from either age or heat.;negative
Every time I eat these cashews, they make me sick. I have to really wash these well then soak them for at least 20 minutes before eating them. I do not have this problem with another company's cashews.;negative
Unopened bag molded after one month storage;negative
This coffee tastes to me like something sweet, maybe raspberry, but I don't taste any nut flavoring.;negative
The sugar content is very high in these Honest drink will not purchased again;negative
These are downright disgusting.  Stale, crumbled, etc.  I couldn't finish one cookie - had to return them.  Yuck, no thanks.;negative
Wife wanted decaf coffee and didn't like the flavor one bit.  Sorry, but if she doesn't like it, it gets a low rating;negative
This coffee is *okay* but it really reminds me of cheap vanilla-flavored protein powder...might need to help it along with some flavored creamer.;negative
taste gross! there are fennel seeds that actually taste good. these are not them.;negative
Son hated, tastes like medicine. He is used to Pediasure I guess. but when I tasted I didn't think it tasted anything like chocolate. Very expensive to be wasted.;negative
They were all broken and I needed the whole stars for gift bags.;negative
No better than the cheapest ramen. I added a shot of soy sauce, some sliced green onion and a bit of Sriracha and it was just OK.;negative
gave these to my kids for valentines day and we had to eat them with a spoon as they were melted together;negative
Vile. So highly over-spiced that I couldn't force myself to finish it. I dumped the remainder in the toilet and then felt sorry for the toilet. I'm giving it 2 stars out of gratitude that it didn't kill me.;negative
I was very disappointed that this was GROUND coriander. Even after enlarging the pic I couldn't tell if it was whole or not. I took a chance and it was NOT. It seems they would label which form.;negative
disappointed in the level of flavor - not only a week coffee, but very little maple flavor.;negative
Theres a lot of filler in the taste of this coffee. More chicory flavor than I like.;negative
These were mostly crushed. Those that weren't crushed tasted OK. I will stick to the Trader Joe's vanilla ones. These aren't worth the calorie difference.;negative
at some point the contents of all boxes were pulverized,boxes were not crushed so i am not sure when or how it could have happened. will be mixing it with pudding or yogurt. will not buy again.;negative
Too small and not worth the calories.;negative
I thought this was replace the chocolate creamer, not even close;negative
These arrived stale with the last number of sell by date wipe off the still taste OK but are reely chewy;negative
"I could not taste  any cinnamon flavor and very little BROWN sugar. It is just sweet. ""Smartfoods Select"" Brown sugar and cinnamon is much better.";negative
shipped in mule expess toke 4 day  was to be with my prime orders but was back order. i got liquid chocolate.;negative
Delivery was great, and its authentic, but its WAY to strong and bitter for my taste! I love their butter toffee, but I HATE this!;negative
Bought these because they used to be good.  Used to be.  Today, they are thin and very short on flavor.;negative
I was ashamed to see them in the home of the person it was sent to. There was hardly anything to see.;negative
Received in January and they expire in February. We purchased for upcoming travel and they'll expire before the trip. When buying a 48 pack, you want it to last more than a month.;negative
I normally like Natures Own but these from Amazon were dryer, not as soft as usual, and tasted a little stale. I was disappointed. I will be going to the store and picking my own from now on.;negative
Very plain coffee, weak and not as good as other Caza varieties. Noticed a bitter flavor comes through.  Other Caza varieties were much better, particularly the Kona.;negative
Not a fan. This stuff actually smells like eggs. I can't stand that smell. My husband likes the product as a mushroom/onio omelet.;negative
My opinion tastes nothing like blueberry not even a hint;negative
I was hoping for a replacement to my favorite ling-ling sauce, but this is too bitter.  Plus the bottles are tiny.  Keep searching!;negative
Thought it was a good deal. Taste is good, but found it cheaper at the local store.;negative
Tastes ok but it's elderflower, not rose.;negative
"There;s something funky about the taste. I won't be buying this again";negative
Bland & boring, tastes like flat aspirin-y water. Knew I shoulda stuck with the chocolate. Chocolate ROX! (Get the chocolate - you won't regret it);negative
not so great--thick like school paste and pretty gritty.  Add some stevia to make it palatable.  Better to get coconut milk--whole- in cans.;negative
"Sorry to be different than everyone else who seemed to love these.
 Guess I got a bad batch, they tasted stale and old, the chocolate esp. I had 3 clusters, tossed the others.";negative
This was not at all what I desired to buy.  Woiw I wish would have read all of the one star reviews before I made this purchase.;negative
"1. too salty. bad for health
2. too much for every pack. leads too salt intake. bad for health";negative
These do not taste anything! Like candy corn. They are white chocolate. Yucky.;negative
This is not a good replacement for Soy sauce at all. And it is really expensive. Too bad I will keep searching for a healthy replacement. Would return it if I could but Amazon will not allow it.;negative
Imagine my dismay when I realized my almost empty box of French Roast is DECAF - surprising since French Roast Decaf isn't even offered!!;negative
It's ok, but over-priced.  I won't buy again because of the price,for a small quantity.;negative
These are the worst tasting energy bars I have ever had in my life. My bathroom rug probably tasted better.;negative
Arrived late - far past due date. Not good for an item that is typically a gift. Lame candy. Loose pieces. Not worth it at all.;negative
It was not a good taste to us.  It left a funny feeling on my tongue. I got rid of it;negative
The item arrived melted and inedible.;negative
I got flap jacked by the good reviews. BLECH!;negative
My mouth was watering.  I was expecting such delight.  It is usually what I prefer when I go to France.  The result was one bite and the rest went in the garbage.  Such a mockery of such great food.;negative
terrible taste it needs to be parmesean only no,romano;negative
not much flavor, and quite expensive.;negative
"It's artificially flavored with ""other natural"" flavors and only a trace amount of fruit and isn't nearly as good as their old Four Fruits Tea.";negative
Amazon customer said it was loaded with heavy metals from China.  I could not bring myself to use the product.  Waste of money.  Said he had the product lab tested.;negative
I mean, I guess as a plain bagel they are fine. Others in my family like them, but I'd rather just walk somewhere nearby and get a fresh bagel - the difference is night and day.;negative
Too expensive for total of 6+ ounces of olives. I will never purchase this again;negative
Pretty flavorless. Trays like a weak batch of red brands, rather than well seasoned lentils.;negative
Not a flavor I enjoyed. Bit heavy compared to Raw USA produced suppliers.;negative
Very metal taste to the paste.  Sorry I bought so much! The funky taste came though my wonderful tomato based recipes and sauce. wish I had not bought such a large quantity to find that out!;negative
"They have good texture, decent flavor. They are obscenely salty, though. Much more so than you'd expect, even from an olive.
Offensively salty!";negative
I did not care for the texture or the taste. I was disappointed Good gluten free products are difficult to find.;negative
This product is intended to  capitalize  on the red velvet craze. It is merely tasteless.;negative
It's a little too thick and hard to chew for me;negative
So hard you can't even chew it! It is so terrible. I have never had hard Turkey Jerkey. Literally. So. Bad.;negative
It doesn't seem to have much caffeine in it. I drunk this to stay up and no joke went to sleep within 30 minutes. And drunk two packets.;negative
Awful, tastes very gross and is REALLY squishy. I have chad EVERY popin cookin and this is the only one I have ever spit out;negative
but not for me!  This may appeal to some. but the chocolate flavor and kale flavors clash with my tastebuds.;negative
The sample was NOT free (99 cents).  Arrived in nearly powdered consistency---the taste is fair and doesn't stand out in any way from granola of other brands.;negative
Hated this! This stuff for some reason effects my mood and puts me in a bad mood when I drink it;negative
It has added sugar, which I wasn't expecting.;negative
Instant coffee - not brew. I have sweet tooth and too sweet for me. Plus it keeps clogging the Keurig flow. Will not buy again;negative
Love the taste of their beef jerkies. These turkey ones--not so much. Too bad. They just have somehow an odd taste. I wish I could describe it.;negative
"Not so good. I was hoping that all of the reviews would be correct about the taste.
I feel like it tastes like dirt;first bite reminded me of top soil.";negative
Too expensive for the small bag. They say 100 servings per bag. Realistically you use about 1/2 tsp to 1 tsp in a drink. So that is 20 servings, not 100. Not worth buying;negative
This was my first Miso soup and I wasn't very impressed.  The flavor is so light that it's almost like eating unflavored noodles.;negative
did not pay attention to the TINY SIZE.;negative
I do not like these cookies whatsoever. I don't know if they are stale or what, but these cookies lack flavor. I will not order these again. Yuck!;negative
Not really good coffee at a high price. Won't buy this again.;negative
These do not taste very good.  They taste heavily of salt to me.  I do not plan on buying them again.;negative
Disappointing and surprisingly bland;negative
Very salty and has a grainy tecture.  It's not smooth like the jarred queso.;negative
Bought as a gift for someone who loves the cookie part of the fortune cookie. She said they were a bit stale and I gave them to her a day after they arrived. Not happy with that part. Came pretty fast.;negative
too salty, I would not buy these again;negative
I think my last two boxes I ordered only had 1/2 of the usual tea!!!!  It is so weak!!!!!;negative
Coffee pods are weaker tasting and a bit lacking in weight compared to the Nespresso line of coffee.;negative
Tasted like it was past the due date.  I like many of their other products, but this was unpleasant.;negative
Not for me, overpriced and doesn't taste that great.;negative
Very disappointed that this gum has High Fructose Corn Syrup.  Will not buy again until it only uses real sugar.;negative
As the title states - I'm looking for JASMINE tea.  this is more like green tea, no hint of jasmine.  Not ordering this again;negative
"4 pieces of sugary bacon for $10. Buyer beware. Mediocre taste.
Make your own it tastes a lot better and it costs less";negative
This extract has a very artificial flavor, go with McCormick brand instead if that's not wanted.;negative
Not good for the guts. It's true they taste  like the regular pringles but you will know the difference after about 40 minutes of eating a can.;negative
I THOUGHT THESE WERE WAY TOO SWEET. THEY ARE COATED WITH DEXTROSE.;negative
I didn't notice these working at all....I'm sending them back.  Maybe it's just me?;negative
It haves a good flavor but is not a good gum. it will last for about 8 minutes until it gets hard and your teeth start hurting.;negative
Many of the apples had spots and bruises. Will not buy again;negative
I gave it away, did not like the texture,hard grains after baking.;negative
These things are dry and sour, every flavor tasted really sour. Maybe they would've tasted better if I had stopped them in something but I couldn't think of what.;negative
I don't like to leave a bad review but I love honey and these did not taste like honey at all. They had more of a Nutty odd flavor.;negative
too fatty, tasted almost undercooked;negative
Ive ordered these from amazon for years. However, Ive had 4 pods just blow up when brewing for no reason. Not sure of the reason. There is an expiration date which is still good.;negative
Not my favorite Fiber One snack. It's okay...;negative
Very tough to chew! It must be for younger, more athletic peeps!  The taste is very good.............;negative
Maybe it wasn't the best batch or something? All I could taste was sugar. :-/;negative
The flour is less than half. I made 3 pancakes! Waste of money.;negative
Mushy and no flavor - also roughly handled and packed - not good at all;negative
"I love the light roast by Don Pablo.
This tasted burnt.
Amazon refunded my purchase.";negative
AWFUL taste...like just the rind was included. Very expensive for a small bottle too. Do not waste your money !!!!;negative
I didn't care for it. Perhaps you may. Although it is natural water from the coconut, it tasted like a colonoscopy prep kit.;negative
The can arrived on time but had two dents, one on top and one on the bottom of the can.;negative
Stale Brazil nuts an tasted bad. I won't buy this brand anymore and not from this company either. I read that stale nuts can cause health problems.;negative
I do not think this is very good tasting. I liked the half-caff idea but it is very bland. If you like coffee this would likely not be liked. zi do not recommend, would not buy again, and I hope this helps.;negative
I love campbells chicken soup in a condensed can, this is nothing like that. The noodles are mushy and gray.;negative
Didn't have much flavor.  Not as good as Brach's.;negative
Couldnt drink water with this. Didn't taste good;negative
It's mediocre at best. I recommend you avoid this offering from Nongshim's selection of instant noodles. It has a very plain and uninteresting spice to it. It's certainly spicy, but not a good spicy.;negative
"Unbelivable, this is stamped in front of the package, ""This product have Lead and other chemicals known to Cause Cancer""";negative
It's cheaper at the store.  I thought these were the 1/2 gallon sizes and I should have read it more accurately.  My fault, but will never buy again.;negative
Not much of a Lemon flavor considering how expensive it is.;negative
They only have 4 kinds & PEANUT BUTTER IS THE MAJORITY!!! They go bad 12/15 & have already started. I am very mad. I won't be buying this again...ever!!!;negative
simply not as pungent or falorful at the Tartufi Truffle Salt that you can also get through Amazon.  I won't purchase this again.;negative
taste so weard, like a mint flavor at the end. i prefer the oder tastes better.;negative
TOO Salty. The only flavor is SALT !;negative
It wasn't the flavor I recall from several years ago;negative
I have been using this product for a decade. The box I received was not the same, the product has changed and not for the better. It is very bitter and I have now moved on to a new product.;negative
I bought 3 flavors of the stevia drops: Chocolate, Toffee and Vanilla Cream.  All flavors have a bitter after taste.  I will not be using them in my morning coffee.;negative
I like india gate rice but this time the rice old with bad smell I don't order again;negative
Not only did I don't appreciate this French Roast coffee, but neither did my house guests. Ended up throwing most of it away. I do however like Communitys decaf;negative
I remember these from years ago......I used to like them.  Not much flavor now.;negative
Very bland flavor. Buy any of the Quest protein powders for better flavor and smooth, flavorful drinks.;negative
Tastes sort of like  Capuchino. But the froth making ingredients contain Trans fats. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this crap. Gevalia normally makes great coffee, but not this time?;negative
They have curry and taste weird. Didn't like them at all. I will not buy them again, also I will only recommend it if you enjoy curry.;negative
Yuck - these definitely ain't Pirates Booty!  I thought these were gross.  I don't understand all the glowing reviews for these cardboard flavored discs.;negative
I won't be buying any  more of this product.  It's too difficult to get out of the can.;negative
Not worth the price.  Just put some olives in a ziplock and save a ton of money.;negative
This isn't what Quench gum is known to taste like. It's terrible. I couldn't even chew one piece longer than 10 seconds. Stick with the original.;negative
I really liked the other Stir mixes (especially the fruit punch), but did not care for this one.  Not enough pineapple flavor no matter how much I added.;negative
The coffee tastes ok.  However, I would never purchase these pods for my K-cup brewer.  I had to use them as tea bags, dropping them into a cup of hot water.;negative
I love the Rishi and the Capital teas, but the Celebration Herbals is too bland for me, even using 2 teabags. If you are looking mostly for turmeric, try this one.;negative
"Wield taste.
This flavor is sugary and but itself it tastes not so good but if I add another coffee flavor or tea with it then it tastes ok.
I returned it.";negative
An unpleasant combo, as far as I'm concerned, but my partner found them acceptable.;negative
"Used to be good - this bottle was not sealed; some seeds were shriveled.";negative
"The peppermint taste is barely there; it doesn't even smell like peppermint. It is very sweet!. Will keep looking for a better one.";negative
I should have read the ingredients more closely.  This had a ton of sugar/carbs in it and I'm diabetic.  I gave the packages I bought away.;negative
I did not taste the kimchi. I tasted salt. I feel like Nongshim made this for American palettes rather than have a korean taste with american packaging.;negative
They must have changed their recipe.  I used to like this brand and flavor, but now  the sweetness is weak and the vanilla tastes fake.;negative
Just get monk fruit syrup. This is way too artifical.;negative
Straight to compost. I am not eating something that could contain heavy metals & caries the California cancerous warning.;negative
Not, what I expected.  This is not balsamic, it should have been labeled flavored red wine vinegar and it's also too watery.;negative
ok sometimes for cats, does not work with birds at all, don't seem that hot at all, Tabasco is hotter.;negative
This used to be my favorite brand. Now they are drenched in sugar to the point they are gross. I might as well eat candy.;negative
It doesn't taste like tiramisu and it's not that great;negative
Really kinda disappointed in these. They were extremely dry and low on flavor. Keebler usually does better.;negative
Very weak tasting coffee.  I would not recommend it.;negative
Tasted old, not fresh. Guess you get what you pay for sometimes with amazon. Now what to do with eleven weird tasting kind bars?;negative
Stale and salty.  Cancelling subscribe and save.;negative
Kernels were too big for air popper, made it burn;negative
"How inedible can a ""stomach- soothing, ginger chew"" actually be? Here's the answer - in a non-US package.";negative
This product actually upset my stomach. It may not upset anybody else. I took a chance, and lost. I wish you good luck.;negative
I don't like the lemon taste, it tastes to strong and artificial.  The amount is perfect for mixing with mayo to make one or two sandwiches;negative
Yuk, being Italian I don't know what I expected, but this sure isn't anywhere near what I expected.  Toooooo much garlic and too many tomato chunks.;negative
Product wasn't worth the price, I will never order it again;negative
They have a weird after taste and they are spicy. i did not enjoy eating them and i love flax seeds , i cant even pinpoint what the weird flavor is.;negative
Very poor quality as we cooked same they all broke into scraps...Totally bad!;negative
These are more like jellies than gummeys. The flavor is OK,but I expected a better product from Haribo. I won't be ordering more.;negative
Not much lemon flavor. I was very disappointed. With a brand name  expected a much better product.;negative
Doesn't taste like mango, so I have to use a sweetener to get it down. Don't know if it will be beneficial for me yet.;negative
I received sea salt and almonds, not raspberry. A. Bit of a disappointment.  Second order same thing.  No raspberry;negative
Good product, but not the price.  I found the same exact product in my local grocery store for less than $7.00.;negative
"Needs more than 2 squirts per 8 oz; more like 4.  Smell is chemical like.";negative
I expected them to be the small type of papaya, but I didn't expect them to be nasty. These were not good. Going back to the Publix Maradol from CArribean Red. Those are great.;negative
It came and started to leak everywhere.;negative
Unfortunately this product taste like straight alcohol. It is very harsh and rough on the taste buds.;negative
If you like watermelon smell without taste this is for you ! Would make good scratch and sniff !;negative
HORRIBLE....OUTDATED!!!!!  Received today  7 Dec 2016....Best by 30 Oct 2016;negative
I love dry roasted and salted pecans.  The ones you find in Planters cans are delicious.  Those were stale with moldy aftertaste.;negative
I guess I don't like salt on my caramel. If you do, you will probably love them!;negative
Tasteless.  I cancelled the subscription.;negative
I didn't like this brand.  Seems course, crunchy and blah tasting.  Prefer a different brand over this brand.;negative
"The licorice tea was not for me, and the fruit flavored ones tasted too bland.
I do love their Apple Cider tea, especially in the colder months.";negative
Think it was old, no flavor  This is 1 of my favorite!;negative
Tastes fine but way too expensive.  Won't buy again.;negative
broth just smells/tastes weird and the noodles aren't very good;negative
Followed all the directions, which was not very easy.  I had to get some tools and help.  No mushrooms ever grew either.  And I was so excited.;negative
Never tasted worse turkey in my life.  I don't believe it was either smoked or peppercorn, but I will never buy it again.;negative
Well.. it must be coffee, but not much flavor...;negative
I was very disappointed after reading reviews. It has an extremely oily aftertaste. I actually threw it out. I'm back with Hellmans & will try Kewpie;negative
Smells nice but not something I could drink every day.  Kind of a bitter chemical coconut flavor that leaves an aftertaste.;negative
Kind of bitter if you don't pull the bag after 30 seconds.;negative
"This is not what I was  expecting, rather bland and lacking the flavor for sure and richness of coffee; it is flavorless in my estimation and sorry I did not send it back.";negative
Came all stuck together from being melted;negative
I haven't tried these since I bought them as a gift. These are shipped as just 50 sticks in bubble wrap. You open it up and they spill everywhere. No label even. Not a good gift.;negative
Extremely sour plan on adding them to some muffins.;negative
Better than the cashew bar.  But, that isn't saying much.;negative
These almonds looks like from old stock. Hard like stones.;negative
I tried, but this just doesn't cut it for a coffee creamer. I'm sticking with Half & Half. :);negative
We really hated these.  They contain an ingredient that makes us sick.  Had to discard.;negative
I love Grade B maple syrup, but this does not taste like  VT maple syrup--tastes metallic. Still better than the pseudo maple syrup sold in the grocery store, but I won't buy this again;negative
Tastes horrible, too spicy, burned my gum. This is NOT a very good substitute or aid to quit dipping tobacco. It's NASTY.;negative
Great snack. Never get tired of it.;negative
The tomato sauce is very good, but every single can was dented!!;negative
"This is only a personal opinion..but way too sweet..
I like a sweet coffee in the afternoon but this one is excessive for me..";negative
It's ok and that's all. VERY GREASY!!!;negative
good try but way out of my price range. Tasted good but 25/lb for coffee is just foolish.;negative
Some good stuff and some not-so-good stuff. The separate fruits are better.;negative
These tasted OK but I don't think they're very low in carbs.;negative
It seems I can't digest xylitol which makes this useless.  If you can digest xylitol it should be great.  I wish I had know it might be a problem.;negative
Meh, not that great. Comes out too thick and gloppy.  More of a chemical than cheesy taste. Not really recommended.;negative
"thought they had the texture of soggy saut&eacute;ed onions didn't think they were like noodles...i prefer better than noodles over these";negative
This is the worst Chai tea I have ever purchased.  It not only smells like flowers, it tastes like flowers.  No tea taste at all.;negative
beef filling has the consistency of paste.;negative
I found the coffee to be too mild for me for the most part while there were several K-cups that had more flavor than others. Dropped this item from my Subscribe & Save account.;negative
Wasnt crazy about these. Didnt find as many uses for them.;negative
If you want to get drunk and tired eat the syrup. It has alcohol sugar which is like drinking the stuff. Regular sugar is better.;negative
Mine arrived separated, expired and dusty.;negative
Greasy and grainy. Meh. Maybe they were just old but the grape flavor was almost gone and they had a greasy, machine-oil like sheen. I threw them out.;negative
Sauce was ok, I think they may have forgot to add oranges.;negative
I didn't think Lipton tea could get any worse.  I was wrong.  Save yourself some grief and use the individual tea bags.  This brews into a cloudy mess.;negative
Got to me WET?  really ?  have not had the chance to dry it to use it;negative
Received this fully wrapped but when i got to the actual plastic sealed over the bowl, it was cut.  Had to toss the product.  Looked like it had been tampered with.;negative
It's great if your constipated, if you take my meaning.;negative
Will not buy again, probably the worst of their flavors;negative
I received 12 cans today and 2 of them were badly dented, not sure it's even safe to eat them;negative
My dad used to eat a cereal called puffed rice and puffed wheat, so I guess I thought these would be the same, but they are teeny, tiny, little balls.  I through them out for the birds.;negative
To many peanuts and raisins. Ridculous! This is not a healthy trail mix in my opinion.;negative
Really didn't enjoy any of it.  Threw away most of each package after trying.  Could be worse I suppose...hence the 2 stars;negative
I wanted to like them and gave them a couple of tries.  I am back to my old bitters.;negative
too much breading and the nuts are of poor quality. I don't think I will buy this brand again, but do like the hot.;negative
Tasted funny when I opened the box. Musty/off tasting. Had to throw away. Sell by date is February so it was not expired.;negative
Excellent product for those wanting to eat organic ;negative
This have senna leafs , will make you have horrible stomach pain. Terrible idea.  If I wanted a laxative I would have got something specific.;negative
This should've been called Cinnamon Spice. I barely could taste ginger.;negative
These were stale. All stuck together into a clump and tasted like plastic from being in the bag for so long. Could barely pull some of them apart. The were like chewing on leather. Definitely not fresh frogs.;negative
Not what I was expecting, I love the Yerba Mate Chocolate, drink it every day;negative
Sorry the icing was too sweet and it wasn't the amount i needed.  I was expecting more in the bucket.  Also when you put it in the refridgerator the icing gets all hard and lumpy and cannot be used again.;negative
Great idea but tastes like straight baking soda. Bitter;negative
I bought for my daughter because she really wanted it, but it is really crap ingredients that I wouldn't let her actually eat.;negative
Not sure if it was a bad batch but didn't taste fresh. I have another on order due to price being better than costco. If its not good... will update and not order again.;negative
I had a lot of pain after eating some Goji Berries.  Came to find out they are part of the nightshade family of which I am allergic.  I wasn't a happy camper for a few days and I gave them away.;negative
"ok these were just weird tasting- weird texture and a lot of busted ones- prob from shipping-
but my dad liked them- so go figure-
I think I just like Doritos or Ruffles!";negative
Very deceptive pictures as you get some tiny grayish green plants with no color to them. I was expecting much better. Sorry.;negative
I love the seasoning salt they sell. I bought this by accident.  It was nothing special.;negative
Hard to try the product when it arrived open.;negative
I really wanted to love the vanilla flavor. It has a bad aftertaste and even though it's alcohol free, it still has that alcohol taste.;negative
I made a sloppy joe meal out of this for me and my sweety. Neither of us could finish it. Even the dogs were wary.  Perhaps a genius cook could make something better but I'm just a regular cook.;negative
"The title says ""original"", but it is not original. this includes green apple not lime. How is that original when they don't have the original flavors?";negative
Too strong ..in flavor.. now what do I do with this box of crackers ?? kinda yucky !;negative
I CAN'T SAY THAT I REALLY HATE THIS PRODUCT, BUT I DIDN'T CARE FOR THE TASTE.;negative
This flour is rancid and had no expiration date on it;negative
Stale, stale, stale.  Amazon picked up the tab.;negative
Tasting one candy after another cannot change the outcome of the test.  Coffee in a candy that preports to be coffee candy has to taste like coffee.  THIS CANDY DOES NOT!!!!!!!!;negative
These must be rejects some are crushed and very difficult getting the wrapper off.;negative
Received with tear in bag.  Packing was good.  Must have happened before shipping.  Afraid to use.;negative
What the heck happened BOB? Terrible, stale, tasteless doesn't all pop, small pops. In other words this is the last time I purchase this popcorn. Even the birds outside are leaving it!;negative
Extremely sweet, even with a lot of water added.  I can drink it diluted to about half strength, if I add lemon juice.;negative
I read the reviews and was so happy to maybe find a suitable to get me off sugar...this ain't it.  It has a horrible chemical taste.;negative
It didn't give me the same mouth feel as real creamer and the flavor was very subtle.  I prefer a thicker creamer with more flavor.;negative
"One of two bags had top opened and both bags were 4 months past their ""best by"" date.  The bags were so flattened and crumpled, they must have come out of the trash bin.";negative
Popcorn burns easy, the taste is terrible.;negative
Will never buy again, tastes stale. White cheddar doesn't taste like what I bought in market;negative
Not a good taste. Very chemical and rubbery.  More like tar than food.;negative
Just opened box n it was filled with soup n mold. Missed return date by 2 days. Not happy.;negative
"Not one of my favorite brands. Tends to be  somewhat on the bitter side and after about 1/2 cup the bitterness gets worse. Much better brands out there; try Horton's for example.";negative
not my favorite flavor  - enjoyed the house blend more;negative
These nuts were gross and stale.  I returned them.;negative
really strong diet aftertaste. NOT good. I like the sugar free fat free chocolate pudding--but this was really gross.;negative
They were too small to open, I got frustrated trying and through them in the trash.  They were unlike the salted ones which were huge and tasty. I would not order them again.;negative
First cracker tastes a little like bacon...but the overpowering taste of black pepper makes it hard to have much more..my grandson who likes bacon...said it burned his mouth.;negative
Only had 10 bars in package what a quality problem. I will never buy a kind bar again;negative
This is garlic powder...dust really and very difficult to use even if you use a fine shaker.;negative
I bought these before and they were delicious, but like many other people said, the box I got from Amazon was not fresh.  The peanut butter was dry and the chocolate was sort of whitish.;negative
Used to really love these as a kid. Having tried them now...don't really like them. Either they changed their recipe or my tastes have deteriorated over the years but these don't taste like I remember them.;negative
I had significant difficulty opening the jar, every time. Then I found a delicious butter flavored coconut oil at Aldi's for a fraction of the price, with a lid that opens easily.;negative
"I was dissappointed in using the PODs as 1/3 of them were defective and left me with ""dirty water"" in my cup..the ones that were not defective were fine.";negative
Allergic. Made me break out in hives. Made my psoriasis 20x worse.;negative
"I don't mind most ""healthy"" foods but this stuff is bad. Doesn't mix well in water. Won't order again.";negative
Very little flavor at all.  I know of people who love this stuff, but to me it's up there with styrofoam.  Too expensive for no flavor. I'd be glad to pay the price if it actually tasted good.;negative
All the positive reviews?? This stuff tastes like sort of sweet watery urine and I never want any more. PASS!;negative
This one at least had a hint of peach, sadly for what I needed, I had to use the whole bottle, yes thats right, the whole damn thing;negative
This is a personal opinion:  Salt is not my best friend, and these contain quite a bit of salt for me to consume.;negative
This product does not sweeten my coffee or lemonade with the recommended serving size. Zero difference after adding it.;negative
Gross, dry, sticks together and tastes like mush. I gave the rest of them away because I could not stomach the taste.;negative
"I do not recommend this product
It is too dry
I like Albacore tuna better
I will give this product away";negative
I found this protein drink to taste chalky and smell medicinal.;negative
The word syrup is used loosely here. I purchased this to use as pancake syrup. I poured it and it came out like water.  Later, I knocked it out of my refrigerator, and it went everywhere. What a mess!;negative
ta, won't ever buy again.steless and stale;negative
The latest order is disappointing. It takes 50% more leaves to achieve the same colour and the taste is still insipid. The package has changed and so has the tea. I will not buy again;negative
"Received decaf coffee not regular coffee
Frustrating";negative
These pods get stuck & I hand to dig hhfm out w/ a spoon or tweezers;negative
seems to allow a good deal of grounds to end up in your cup;negative
Not oatmeal at all. Save your money;negative
Labels faded, clearly older overstock. Taste is fine, didn't really wow us. Arrived on time.;negative
Soft fudge terrible texture...Buy the truffles they were awesome;negative
Bitter taste.  I was looking for something stronger, but this has a bitter taste.  Won't be purchasing again.;negative
Not crazy about the milk part _ I guess because its skinny - they save calories by only having 1/2 the product - I end up with 1/2 glass of Cappuccino;negative
"I had goat milk from a carton and it is way better.
In a car horrid.";negative
The wafer texture is enjoyable. These boast a low sugar content, but this particular flavor is the equivalent of brushing your teeth with pixie sticks.;negative
POOR PACKAGING, RECEIVED VERY EXPENSIVE COOKIE CRUMBS!;negative
Not great. Worst of all Ice Cube flavors we've tried.;negative
very small portions for the price.  not that great;negative
I've enjoyed really good Tupelo honey and sorry to say this one did not taste special to me, it tasted like inexpensive, generic honey.;negative
I didn't care for this assortment.  The flavors were off.;negative
First time having it and I was disappointed. For all I know its how its supposed to taste but oh my lol it was so strong. Bleck;negative
Ok....not very flavorful in my opinion.;negative
Most of these apples came bruised to much that my kids wouldn't eat them;negative
I should say I did love it until it ended up on the most highly contaminated list.  Contaminated with insecticide.;negative
It doesn't really taste like jaggery. Perhaps its a different flavored jaggery.;negative
I did not like the taste of these nuts - they seemed stale and did not taste good to me - I won't buy again;negative
This powder tasted lie regular milk, it's almost as if the wrong milk powder was put in the wrong container, will not buy again;negative
Was hoping for a nice tea with a hint of mint. Instead, the tea tastes like grass clippings! The mint part is great, but can't get over the grassy taste. Yuck!;negative
Not what I expected. They are not sparkling enough nor tasty, just average.;negative
If I had to option to give it no stars I sure would do that. No taste, no flavor, just a salty, salty, salty mess.;negative
Texture when cooked is doughy/floury and not even. Did not care for it.;negative
They should disclose that this has an Allergy Alert.  It is packaged in a facility that also handles tree nuts, peanuts, corn and soybean.  I had to thow mine out.;negative
These are not the soft, chewy Brachs candies advertised. These are tiny hard candies. Very disappointed.;negative
These are nasty, No one in my family will eat them. We love Kind bars but not these.;negative
Total ripoff. Arrived with 7.49 price sticker;negative
The upper portion of our bag of rice was up to standard. HOWEVER the lower 3rd of it was bad. so we will not be buying this any more;negative
"Was very expensive coffee for what tasted cheap or could have been stale.
Very very weak flavor. No refunds!
Tossed in trash can.";negative
Tastes OK, but seems like mass production, IDK what kind of conservants and other poisons they put in there;negative
Has an odd licorice-y almost metallic taste to it.  Very bitter, even with sweetened creamer.;negative
and the sodium content is rediculous... was chugging water the rest of the night after I ate one of these.  To the garbage they go;negative
This is just mediocre...save your money and buy the Cuban espreso.  This would make a nice cup of coffee but when you're wanting a really rich espresso flavor...this just isn't it.;negative
Nice, but too soft and sweet. Thought they might be better, but not.;negative
"I buy this brand at least twice a month, but bought this Grape Acai flavor by mistake -  NASTY!! Terrible flavor!!
Love the Variety Pack and the product in general.";negative
This just did not live up to our expectations. All three tried it and found the taste only fair and too sweet. Make that 6 thumbs down.;negative
It's OK a little pricey for the taste and only 12 ounces!! Seemed old too!!;negative
This product came already opened. The product came with the zip drop closed but the seal cut off. This means it is not sanitary. I would like a replacement of the product, then I will give a good review.;negative
First this candy does not taste like rocky road. It taste like chocolate caramel.. The candy is way to expensive for so little. There is nothing special about this product to justify the price.;negative
Terrible - very weak coffee with little flavor, never purchase this one ever again.;negative
Awful taste and was the worst thing I have ever eaten. After a few bites I thre it out. It's bland and nothing helped to make it taste matter. Even the dogs would not eat it;negative
This is grape and apple juice with grapefruit as a third ingredient. I feel tricked and it's a bit too sweet. Not going to reorder;negative
I don't like coconut water, apparently.;negative
The almond butter is good but the bottom of the jar was broken !;negative
I received this item today, and it was terrible.  The candy was old and melted.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.;negative
"Nothing but powder!!!
All broke up!!!";negative
not as good as I thought they be. I remember liking the originals, but this one tasted off to me somehow.;negative
Bland and tasteless. Not worth the time. Wasn't expecting much for the price. It met that lack of expectations.;negative
I'm so sorry that I bought these.  Taste really bad to me.  Will try to give them away.;negative
Alcohol is was too pronounced, barely can taste any flavor with the alcohol being so overpowering;negative
No one in our family cared for these. Didn't find that these had a very nice flavor. They were bland at best.;negative
Didn't realize it took over an hour to cook.  Buyer be aware.;negative
Tastes like watered down black pepper to me.  Sorry.  They have some wonderful teas, but for me this is not ones of them.  Will have to see if i can use them as a broth seasoning.;negative
seriously over priced for what you get! 6 candy bars. gads.;negative
This product has a chemical taste that I find offensive and nasty.  No more for me!;negative
"I wanted so badly to love these..
Easy, convenient, healthy.
But, they all taste horrible. Flavorless, almost like cardboard. I tried each box and threw most of the product away.";negative
Evidently not my thing.  Squishy and not a good eat.  I have never had a chestnut so I have no other comparison.;negative
Bought these 2x. While they are a great snack this entire box came with packages of brownie crumbs.  So disappointed.;negative
Tastes primarily of tomato and sugar, this is much closer to a regular tomato vegetable soup than a Texas-style chili.;negative
When I received my package it had been opened and cookies were missing;negative
Hi!  Gross!  I really enjoy sugar!  However, these are too sweet...even for me.  I like that they are organic &  vegan, however.  Please reduce sugar content.  Thank you!  Sincerely, Dolly;negative
Kernels are not tender and it is not hulless.;negative
They were bland and too hard. I gave them away after trying one package. I only gave 2 stars because of the nutritional information.;negative
They are ok in taste but too expensive.;negative
Shapes are great colors are pastel.;negative
taste Not like pumpkin, Not close. I won't buy from this company again, I have to throw them in the trash. capt ez and friends;negative
Too hard. I don't recommend if you have dental problems;negative
Nowhere was this product identified as JERKY. i HATE JERKY! Rather than bother with returning this JERKY I'll see if my grandson wants it. Please identify this product as jerky rather than cuts!!!;negative
This was not good...not good at all.;negative
It says it arrived in a package on Saturday with another item, the other item did arrive but the tea did not arrive even though it said it did.;negative
Do not deliver again. It way 3 month reorder delivery but I cancel that. The dark bars were very hard and dry.;negative
Found this absolutely terrible! Barely tasted like strawberries and the artificial sweeteners after taste was prominent. Not even worth 1 star.;negative
Was way too sweet. Not what I remember Mojo tasting like.;negative
Popcorn tasted old. The other issue is that it as advertised  lists coconut oil as the oil, however when you get the package it says it can be blend of oil or another oil altogether.;negative
Not happy with the flavor. I will probably mix it with another tea. I will not buy it again.;negative
Only use in cold drinks. Bitter taste otherwise. Wish I would only have tried one flavor first.;negative
About 70% hard almonds and hazelnuts with very little salt-;negative
This has a taste that I cannot get past to see if it helps with my cycle. I can put up with some really weird tea, but not that one. I really like many other yogi teas.;negative
Didnt make it here without liquifying and curdling. Otherwise, I assume it is delicious.;negative
Really awful. Tasteless with a weird texture. Ordered the orange as well and it's equally as bad. Ruined my Christmas cookies.;negative
Returned. Flavor is not good. Inlive Hopsier products but this wasn't for me;negative
the venison bars were too dry and hard to eat;negative
This bacon had a lot of fat and dark pieces in it and was stringy.  It also went bad before it was supposed to even kept in the fridge.;negative
The taste is really bad.  But, even worse is the fact that the rice does not cook properly.;negative
I love the idea of using organic coffee especially if you drink it daily.....Unfortunately I am not a fan of the flavor. Disappointed......;negative
Sorry but eggs are broken each time. Far from convenient. Still have to go to store. So I stopped fresh. Need to work out bugs. Plus keep items consistent.;negative
If I could return this item I would, first I feel like I got cheated compared to the Killer Hogs I received the same day, this stuff smells like crap compared to the killer hogs, probably just trash it.;negative
I am a fan of Barren Creek Peppered, Cajun, Original, and Extreme fire flavors but this is terrible! dX I Would NOT buy this again.;negative
This is a hot mess. It's a sad shame when gum is sooooo hard til your face is tired before you start chewing good. Ughhh, never purchasing this again.;negative
These are awfully expensive for that amount I have to use in my coffee to even get any flavor out of them....;negative
Of all the Atkins type food I have ever eaten This has to be the worst. Just wrighting about them I can still taste them and its nasty. My Dog would not eat them and I have 2 cases. Lesson learned;negative
Not nearly as strong/good as the sachets by the same company. I love the Hot Cinnamon Sunset sachets, but these bags seem a lot less flavorful for some reason.;negative
Exorbitantly priced, like 3 times than usual.;negative
sent it back, didn't know if they were bad or if it was just terrible flavoring;negative
dry, saving them in case need emergency food;negative
This tastes AWFUL. It tastes like tea that's been left in a water bottle and left to mold for a few days. It smells bad and tastes worse. Maybe I got a bad batch, but I cannot recommend this.;negative
"ingredients were not listed.  can not eat this with allergies.  will be tossing in garbage.

Ingredients SHOULD be listed.  thank you.....";negative
I am generally a big fan of Hershey's products.  As for this assortment, if you need an occasional SUGAR fix, buy this.  However, if you need an occasional real CHOCOLATE fix, go to See's or comparable.;negative
old and dried out. Too dried and hard to even eat;negative
I think this is another one of those products that has an acquired taste. I am not crazy about it. I bought it because I had seen it used so many times on the cooking shows.;negative
No real flavor to any of them, and most of them were pretty wet when I opened the wrappers. Offputting texture.;negative
I found taste and consistency unedible.;negative
"Very stale, crumbly; had to throw out; request refund. Thank you";negative
the tea it makes is too thin, not a strong flavor. also the bags break easily.;negative
Nothing so special that I can't find locally. Mega stuff=mega disappointment.;negative
to me this tastes like sugar and cloves, the complete pumpkin flavor is just not there. I prefer the starbucks pumpkin blend.;negative
Regardless of what the picture shows what is shipped is not organic and is not as displayed. It is the same brand and the same type of tea.;negative
Bag was popped open and chips were crushed;negative
"I was expecting a normal Mocha Coffee like I would buy at a vendor, rich and creamy. This however was just
badly flavored coffee. Everyone at work agreed with me. I would not buy this again.";negative
It is drinkable but I don't get the crisp satisfaction as I did with the more expensive drinks.;negative
Not a good product....stuck together taste is awful.;negative
Paper bag rips easily. Love the markers though;negative
it  arrived  all  melted  and  gooshy  ,  refrigatored  and  choc.  every  where;negative
Jovial makes some wonderful gf pasta...this is not one of them, unfortunately;negative
"Popcorn was OLD and STALE, not fit to eat.  More like pig feed corn.  I can not recommend
this popcorn and would suggest you buy FRESH popcorn at local supermarket.";negative
The popcorn flavored jelly bean overwhelms all the other flavors. It's all you can smell when you open the container and all the jelly beans taste like it. I was very disappointed;negative
taste horrible.... i love reeses puffs (the real thing) the the cereal, EEEEEEW! real nasty. taste horrible, not for me ever again;negative
The pieces are Like you're putting a piece of sugar in your mouth. The pieces are so small and very very soft. But they have a good flavor I like sweetness.;negative
Don't like the taste and it gave me diarrhea.;negative
I love the regular Haribo gummie bears but these taste like artificial green lime. They do make me burp though!;negative
"No matter what it says in the description, these are slightly off-size, and will NOT work in either of the two types of ""Keurig"" units I have!";negative
Small bruised beans. OK taste. Not premium grade quality;negative
I received this product as a promotion. Unfortunately, I did not like it. It's kind of salty & loaded of not good stuff (artificial colors/glaciers). I'm glad it was free ...;negative
I am sorry but this did not work for me.  Additionally, the taste was very harsh on my pallet.;negative
Tasted nothing like Cheez-Its, even though they look the same.  Upset my stomach.  Box arrived completely crushed... ate a bunch then threw the rest out.;negative
I thought it would be creamed, but it was just full of coconut strands.;negative
has A LOT of sugar alcohol ended up throwing away save your money and buy real thing. I don't even taste lo han.;negative
Didn't like the flavor. My very favorite is Zhena's Green Tea or Black tea Chai.;negative
Terrible.  No flavor.  I won't be ordering this brand again.  I love dried fruit of all kinds - perfect source of quick energy for vegans - but this does NOT make the cut.;negative
I couldn't find a way to dissolve this stuff. Called the company, but the guy I talked to was rude and didn't even try to help.;negative
These are Disgusting! Waste of my $$ no way to return! Bleck!;negative
Little Cottage, should Not have Cost around $30.;negative
This was not what I expected! The texture was awful.;negative
The cinnamon flavor is good. The benefits of xylotol are good. The only disappointing thing is the flavor is gone very quickly.;negative
This tasted horrible! As others have said, its bland and the texture is off completely. I couldn't eat it and had to throw it out. I won't purchase again.;negative
Great fun item but waaaayyyyy tooooooo salty... returned it;negative
Tasted like tin and gave us the s***s;negative
To me, this doesn't taste anything like banana chocolate. It tastes like rooibos. Drinkable, but not what I expected...especially at this price.;negative
LOVE Breitsamer honeys but this one is not my favorite.;negative
Product was already starting to expire when received;negative
Really didn't care for the texture and taste.;negative
Your product came to me spoiled! I through it in the garbage!;negative
Not the same as the store. It was dry and looked like it could have been sitting in a hot wesrhouse for weeks;negative
these are freaking corn chips.  maybe there's some egg in there?  Maybe.  But really, these are just overpriced corn chips.;negative
Purchased these by mistake..thought they were the regular ones. Did not like at all!;negative
Too sweet.  Someone's review said 'not fattening'.  Not sure how this very sugary product could be healthy or not fattening.  Does not appear to be  high quality fruit. Also, it is a product of Thailand.;negative
The rice is more eldenty than I care for in a soup;negative
Nahhh...I now prefer big chunks of garlic cloves;negative
These were awful tasting.  They also smelled not quite right.  Threw them out!;negative
Cookies were packaged well, but few of them were still intact. They crumbled at a touch and were lacking sweetness. Tasted more like an unflavored biscuit.;negative
Not a fan. After drinking a cup of this I'm still tired and end up drinking a cup of regular coffee. Plus I love the taste if coffee, so this product is not for me.;negative
The damn canister is full of Polish directions!  Not a word in English, that just is not right.  How does it taste?  Mediocre at best, the taste of cardboard comes to mind.;negative
This was ordered by mistake as it isn't sugar free. I had to give it away as I couldn't use it;negative
OK chocolate, but Hershy is just as good and a fraction of the price.;negative
I thought when they said chunky I was thinking that there would be lots of noodles, chicken, and veg in it but however that is not the case. The soup tasted real bland no flavor;negative
The batch I received doesn't have much flavor.... I will stick with the regular Hazelnut instead of the creamy one in the future.;negative
Mine arrived with all the potatoes already 'sprouted'...asked for refund.;negative
Has not much taste. Does not taste like Jasmine it was not fresh. I been drinking Jasmine tea for years.;negative
"this is only medium roast, far from dark.
if you like me prefer strong dark coffee eg. french roast....don't buy this";negative
I didn't like the combination. The taste is off on this one. I will not buy again. They did come fresh and well packaged.;negative
do wish I could unearth the incredible coffee candy my NYC friend used to deliever once a year. This is a poor substitute.;negative
I think my homemade granola bars taste better than these. Has some kind of aftertaste or something. Maybe they are too sweet for my taste?;negative
The bitter taste of the Stevia ruins it.;negative
Same coffee as Rasta Bean. Just using a different box for exact same coffee!;negative
I didn't like the flavor very well.  It has a kind of weird after-taste that lingers on the tongue.  I wouldn't recommend this product.;negative
My glass jar arrived with ghee having leaked past the seal and onto the jar. I've tried some of it and I don't think it was spoiled but it was still disappointing to get a grease covered jar in the mail.;negative
Way too expensive, could not taste the blackberry hint as promised. Tasted like normal unflavored water.;negative
Delicious---BUT HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP and other unnatural ingredients.;negative
This coffee is a good tasting coffee but this price is way too high. You can buy it in the stores for half this price!;negative
This is ok but  not as good as I expected.;negative
these were all broken into pieces when they arrived and way to sugary.;negative
Product due to expire within two weeks.;negative
It tastes fine but it isn't really sleepytime tea. There is no valerian in it. I'll be sticking with the regular sleepytime and sleepytime extra.;negative
So gross. It was like eating cardboard - well the 3 bites I managed to choke down. Yuck-o.;negative
Ran out quickly. Odd after taste. Never buying again.;negative
"it is just me but man is this stuff sweet; could not tame it mixed with darker stuff
my sister loved it";negative
"terrible coffee.
no flavor
misrepresenting labeling and advertising";negative
Sorry but this tea has to taste, smell, or color...it is like drinking plain hot water.;negative
I had to return due to an unpleasant smell & taste, it was like it was rotten.;negative
They were all stuck together in the bag, unlike the gummy bears, so I will not be reordering.;negative
My son said half of one out of 10 was ok. Rest were bad!!!;negative
Disgusting flavors! Stick with the peppermint!;negative
I decided to try these out and ugh, I hate the flavor. Has a disgusting after taste too. Do not recommend.;negative
"I tried it The first sip was wow this is bad. It is rough,
Not Jamaican.
I think if its a blend I cant imagine with what.
Its not even good off the shelf variety";negative
You cant taste anything and makes really weak, watery coffee. Smells amazing! But tastes really bad. Dont waste your money.;negative
I didn't like this one as much as others. It had a very grainy ( almost crystallized like) texture and not rich creamy texture I've  experienced with other Manuka honey.;negative
While I really love Sheila G's regular brownie brittle, I didn't care for the salted caramel bites.  I usually love the salty-sweet taste but I didn't like these enough to pay any extra for them.;negative
It tastes and smells like burnt toast - will not reorder.;negative
"Compared to some other Ghees I found the to be grainy and tasteless. Also it needs to be stirred at every use and that's messy.
Also large jar is cumbersome and lid it difficult to remove.
Try another ghee.";negative
Dehydrated Banana Chips - 2 Pound Can. Did not like it - could not fine a way to use them. Probable would be OK if you were really stuck living outside with not much to eat.;negative
not California apricots they are med.;negative
This is the worst chai I have ever tasted.  I complained to Lipton who told me they had expert tea tasters, well they need to get new ones.  This is like drinking infused black pepper.  I threw it away.;negative
This is probably better for people that have a very bland pallet, but even if I add spices, salt and pepper etc. it's still not appealing.;negative
not as flavorful as expected from previous reviews...  they're taking up space in my pantry and don't feel the urge to use them if you know what i mean;negative
Way overpriced for only one box and the pasta itself is extremely gritty and has a lackluster flavor at best. Do not waste your money.;negative
This thing did not last no longer than it took to get. Save your money.;negative
Nothing like the Wolfgang Puck I was hoping for. I would never order it again. Disappointed to say the least.;negative
It was ok, but it has MSG in it, so I won't buy again. :(;negative
I bought this when i heard coconut oil was good for your face, but gave up on that tratment as it was too messy!  I am sure it is good for other purposes.;negative
Taste is missing - where is that big soy punch;negative
this is not complex or subtle.  heavy on the wintergreen. light on richer, herby flavors.  I hoped this would be a way to sidestep making my own, but I guess I'll have to . . . or go rootbeerless.  Never!;negative
taste great but they have high fructose corn syrup!!!!!;negative
The fake sugar kills the taste of these drinks;negative
I do not like that this item came to me in 6 small cans instead of one large can shown in the picture.;negative
"Was greasy and too much packaging on the small sticks. Decent value
My husband is not picky at all he will eat almost anything, and ate them, but he did not want me to reorder them.";negative
Not as good as solid white, taste like chunk light. Not happy with this at all and will never buy again;negative
Wasn't delicious and it just as the package stated. The sauce gave me a stomach ache.;negative
"Purchased this after reading many positive revues. We were disappointed. It's ""rubbery"" and a bit oily as well. Not worth the time savings.";negative
I guess I  don't like organic cacao.;negative
These nibs are gross tasting - no cocoa flavor at all. Have purchased the Organic Traditions cocoa almonds and they are yummy. These are awful.;negative
i thought I was purchasing real edible flowers, not those in a sugar wafer form.  I am looking for more;negative
"Disappointing. The tuna was minced; it was lacking in flavor; the coconut oil imparted no flavor either. Not even as good as the Starkist packets at your grocers. Give this one a miss.";negative
Tastes terrible.  Would not recommend and will not purchase again.  Was pricey too.;negative
This did not thrill  me.  I was not happy with the ingredients.  I will not buy again.;negative
Not for us... Not tasty and strange texture made these inedible for our family.;negative
One of the worse tasting cheese I have ever tasted;negative
I eat gluten free and love man n cheese. I was very excited to see a quick version. However, the taste is just not anywhere up to par with Annie's box mixes. The stove cook version is much better tasting.;negative
Won't buy again, taste like chemicals and leaves strange taste in mouth.;negative
I keep trying these and they continue to disappoint.  They never taste good and do not stay fresh for more than 1 or 2 days.;negative
there like dirt or someting everytime i eat it feel like i have dirt in my teeth makes my skin crwl;negative
I made the risotto just like the pkg. recommended. Still way too crunchy. Husband very disappointed.;negative
"I bought it for my son who is 2 years 10 months old.
He does not like it and is happy with the fish crackers which tastes better than this one.";negative
If you like the taste of cardboard you will love this.;negative
Flavorless, and without any of the characteristics of butter, such as it would not help anything to brown.  Mainly it just made a foam that was awkward.;negative
This package is only a finger full. I won't order again.;negative
"not good!!
such amateurish product!!!
it simply does not taste the texture or flavor of stroopwafels!
Real stroopwafels can withstand the steam from hot tea; these just falls apart instantly upon contact";negative
this is the first time that I have had a less than favorable review-the sunflower kernals were not fresh,tasted rancid. I won't purchase this item again.;negative
I'd tell you more, but I don't want to get a law suit against me. But don't buy this... crap!;negative
I have stopped buying this product after reading an article that described the ingedients.;negative
Tastes awful! Give me the good old regular honey!;negative
very nice product good for salads etc, but since it wasen't packeged good and the bottle was leaking i cant use it for food. amazon won't stand up to there bad packing of this item.;negative
Great taste but package is so small  you pay too much in my opinion for quantity..;negative
Every time I use these, I find coffee grounds in my cup. It leaks like mad. The taste is not that great either. It's very bland and boring.;negative
Thought I could change my mind into eating this since trying it as a child. Not so much;negative
HORRIBLE tasting, I do not recommend !!  Three in garbage can;negative
they were stale and hard. I was so disappointed.;negative
"Economic pack, open arabica , taste good ! Happy so far.

Except one or two
You really want to throw them in trash";negative
All of these Pukka teas I have purchased (3). Are tasteless. They are not cheap either. Wouldn't be buying any of their products again.;negative
This Anthony's brand sour cream is terrible.  It has Absolutely NO FLAVOR. Much too bland to enhance the taste of anything. It is also very gritty. I truly recommend that you Do Not Purchase this item.;negative
"We tried this brand based on decent reviews & price but were unhappy with the texture; the popcorn is very tough.  I will likely donate or toss.";negative
This was an experiment spice, did not try because I did not like the scent.  Gave to my son, who is more adventurous in cooking;negative
The flavors were disappointing considering the brand. I will not be ordering these again;negative
Horrible nothing like it used to be;negative
These things are terrible.  They have a waxy coating and some sort of chemical on top.  The taste of the chemical is very prominent.  I can't even give these things away.;negative
i would love to know how these eggs are but i had to spend 20 minutes cleaning them off of my fresh vegetables and then had to go buy replacement eggs.. thanks for the homework Amazon fresh!;negative
Arrived stiff as a rock. I could probably hurt someone with it! I'll stick to the local Vons for fresh baked breads from now on.;negative
Weird aftertaste?  Plasticky or something, will not reorder. Compared to the regular packaging, these tasted really strange.;negative
Found out that most of these expired in July of 2017. I bought them in September! These ones are hard as a rock. Hurts my teeth trying to eat them.;negative
wife thinks these are ok but they taste funny to me.  i prefer jacklinks...;negative
Pictured as oblong and greenish, larger pumpkin seeds.  These are the tiny variety that all supermarkets have and a lower quality.;negative
Found bugs in them after a month of receiving them. How do they have bugs... moth like things... if the plastic package is sealed?;negative
Not a fan of these, the bumble bee version tastes much better.;negative
Terrible taste and only lasted in my cabinet for a week.;negative
no preparation instructions, priced significantly higher than comparable products with same taste and texture. packaging was not superior to like products. shop around, you can do better;negative
It was horrible. I wouldn't take it if it were for free.;negative
Ewwww....Not tasty at all... :(  Very disappointed & a complete waste of money. :(;negative
"These arrived totally melted; there were no ccoling packes in the package and it's 95 degrees outside";negative
A laxative in a bag! Stomach pains, cramps and diarrhea if you eat just a few!!;negative
Very poor quality.  I have been buying dates from Anna and Sarah and very happy with it. But the cashews were very disappointing. Unfortunately, I bough 3 lb. bag.  Will never buy Cashews from them.;negative
"Was not the green color I have bought from stores, for the last 2 or 3 years.  It said Apple on the pkg., but they were a cream color and did not taste
like the ones I have been buying.  I threw them all out.";negative
We ordered this for the different flavors than the more readily available 3rd Edition.  But what came was the 3rd Edition box.;negative
tasty low call treats, too may small chips and crumbs in bottom of the bag;negative
I ordered Newman keurig vue coffee cups and got Starbuck's house blend. It's ok, but it's not what I ordered.;negative
I added this to some oatmeal&it taste just like rubbing alcohol;negative
These are the hardest gummy bears I've ever had. Not sure if I got a bad batch or if this is just how they are.  Would not recommend!;negative
Does not even smell like coffee when roasting.;negative
I always bought this item, in a bigger package, which was wonderful. This size package is not that good. No zip & close. Meat is very small & tough.;negative
Terrible. No maple flavor. Used the entire bottle to make maple bar icing, and no one could detect any maple flavor.;negative
"All pretzels or pretzel-type chips in this mix makes it bland and B-O-R-I-N-G.  It wasn't too a bad price and I like the container so all is not totally lost; I just wouldn't recommend it or buy it again.";negative
So sorry I bought this.  And in bulk so am trying to give it away.  The ultra vanilla favor is just too much.;negative
not happy with this product taste is off the color, smell  and look is off . sending a letter to chicken of the sea to tell them the same.;negative
they are not the brach brand - it is a ripe off;negative
It is absolutely ridiculous! To raise price 3 times! Nobody will buy it, but sugar itself is excellent;negative
I am not SURE what I thought this was suppose to be but it kind of tasted like fig poop;negative
"This has a disgusting taste. The reviews here are misleading.
I will stick to real sugar or other artificial sweetners.";negative
Stale box this time, canceling subscription.;negative
The product was old and melted which causes a mess while eating them. Every bite of the melted product sends chocolate partials flying every where.;negative
This was grainy and not very tasty. The packet I received was also TINY-- maybe a few servings. I was expecting a lot more matcha! Certainly would have preferred it to taste better at least.;negative
"Two stars for the quality of the product.
Three stars removed for the ridiculous price.";negative
CAMPBELLS GREEN DRINK HAD TOO MUCH SODIUM CONTENT FOR ME TO DRINK...I AM TAKING BLOOD PRESSURE PILLS  AND I HAVE TO WATCH BLOOD PRESSURE;negative
Ok. But not really good for me to recommend or buy it again.;negative
These would be ok for kids snacks but there isn't much in a bag maybe three peices and crumbs. They were fresh however just not an adult size snack. Like just scraps in the bag.;negative
The taste is ok, but the penut itself are not that well cooked. It was not crispy and crouch like it should be at this price. A disappointment.;negative
"The most disgusting cracker I have ever tasted

 this sounds harsh but the texture is great  that is about it they are a complete joke . The Taste is like eating a tire, LOL. They are very disgusting .";negative
Wonderful candy.  I've ordered it before 12 pounds at a time but I got the wrong product this time.  I see from other recent reviews that I'm not alone;negative
Really bad tasting! I usually get mine from Harry n David but I thought I'd try this one... Bad idea.;negative
The Chocolate flavor of the Moringa Tea is AWFUL!!! I threw it in the trash.;negative
It is quite salty & I think the ingredients should be more clearly listed for people who may have food sensitivities.yeast extract is often just a fancy name for MSG.;negative
i did not like this brand, mine came with a yellowish color;negative
this has a very strange taste, not a blueberry taste at all, at least not concerning my taste buds.  Bigelow is much better.;negative
These were ok, but arrived partially melted.  And it took three  months to arrive.  I wouldn't order these again.;negative
I tried it and not too crazy about the fiber version.  I'm a huge Splenda fan, but the fiber one just isn't as good.;negative
Faint taste of Kahlua.  I wouldn't order it again. It has a robust coffee taste but you need to imagine the Kahlua.;negative
I wanted dark chocolate and wound of with milk chocolate.  Started order process on dark and somehow order was change in cart.;negative
If you like sweet tea, this is not the tea to buy.  You can barely taste the sweetness in it.;negative
I haven't had much success after two tries with my Crusinhart Bread machine..bread came out flat and hard..;negative
"I should have known for the price...

I love all sorts of tea, especially super strong ones.  This, however, tastes like newspaper / grass clippings.";negative
The taste was artificial. I stopped the monthly order. I would not order again. I was disappointed. The rum flavor was OK, but the underlying cake was not right.;negative
Once tasting this gum, it was clear pomegranate was not one of my preferred flavors for gum. My colleague enjoyed it instead!;negative
I had an allergic reaction to this product which made me nauseous and shaky. It took me a day to feel better. I advise you try it if you can before you decide to spend the money.;negative
The strawberries were soft and were moldy with in 2 days of delivery. They were ordered Monday the 22nd, delivered Tuesday between 10am-1pm, and were moldy Thursday 8am.;negative
I was very disappointed to find that this tasted like cake mix . I made them once and have not used it since. Unfortunately, I ordered several boxes.;negative
Don't love the taste. I'm trying to be creative and add them to different things to see what I like best.;negative
It's terrible. Tried one bag, gave the rest away. Don't waste you're money on this Jerky.;negative
Healthy requests means no flavor, little salt and little fat. Need salt and hot sauce to make it passable.;negative
Bought them as a joke but common... These cookies are unnaturally orange and taste odd.;negative
these thing are not worth your money this is the only thing I have bought on hear that I hated I am so glad I didn't have to pay a lot for them I would not recommend them to any body.  FORGET THEY EVEN EXIST;negative
not what I expected. I didn't realize they were sweetened coffees and I cannot have sugar;negative
These aren't that great. They don't taste very good or fresh. It tastes rather cheap, IMO. The quality doesn't seem to be very high. I'd stick with tuna instead.;negative
Probably the worst tea I have ever tried and I like a variety of flavors. I don't even know how to describe it, but its just terrible. Stay well clear of this tea.;negative
Unfortunately they were old & dried out - had that aged gray look & I returned them - maybe it was an exception?;negative
Only 2 I like out of 4. Like Lemon Lime, Peach Mango. The Raspberry Lemonade is horrible, as well as the Strawberry Kiwi. I can't drink cokes anymore and have to drink water. I would recommend Stur.;negative
expensive. I saw it at a local store that it is half price.;negative
"Not purchasing
 2x..I think they forgot the lime and it tastes like non fat.
You might like it though!";negative
I thought this coffee had a very sour taste to it. I really didn't like it;negative
The coffee is not very strong. The flavors are not very flavorful and not very pronounced. Will not order again. Disappointed.;negative
They were okay but my husband and I preferred the orang and cherry M &M over the raspberry. I wouldn't buy again.;negative
"I texted the water. It was a 7-8 PH.
False advertising ?  It was good but not the high PH it was supposed to be. If you get it, test it so I can j ow if mine was a bad batch";negative
I don't know how someone can mess up hot tea, but these folks manage.  The tea has a funny after taste which makes it now at all enjoyable.;negative
"Gotta say I'm disappointed in this tea, for it doesn't have a strong chai taste
that I so love.";negative
Personally I did not care for this coffee.  It is a Dark Roast which I do enjoy on occasion.  It appeared to be very acidic and failed to leave a satisfying taste.;negative
I purchased this as a gift for my adult grandson and his wife. He loves pumpkin anything as a rule. He and wife both commented that there was a nasty aftertaste. Won't be buying this again.;negative
This oil tastes very bitter.  I ordered this because it had good reviews, so I don't know if it is old, bad, or in a contaminated tin.;negative
Tastes like cheap black tea....none of the oolong flavor;negative
They have an odd flavor.  They smell a bit like vinegar, but they don't taste like it.  They stick to my teeth like no other pork rind.  I regret this purchase.;negative
Over half of the cans arrived so dented they were unsafe to use. At $2 per can, that is a substantial loss! I'm VERY unhappy!!;negative
This can was missing the lid and the vacuum seal was punctured.  This would have rendered the coffee not usable.  Unfortunately, because it is a food product , it had to be discarded.;negative
Beware, this is a Product of China!!!! The berries came dried up. Not moist like raisins and almost as hard as pumpkin seeds.  Amazon did give me a refund.;negative
Changed ingredients jars I received had MSG and SUGAR!.. returned them!;negative
Not enough there in taste for any coffee much less one labeled as espresso! Look elsewhere next time I guess!;negative
Not much Chocolate flavor. With sugar and cream its tolerable but I prefer my coffee black. I won't be getting this one again.;negative
I usually like Sam ills products, but not this one. It was very salty and had a strange taste. I will not buy again.;negative
I love goat cheese, but I did not like this one- will not buy again.;negative
I love grapefruit and crystal light flavor packs so this seemed perfect. Nope. It takes 3+ packets to get any flavor in one glass of water. Even then it is not a great taste. Disappointed.;negative
Maybe I am spoiled but Trader Joe's sugar free chocolate is my standard. Much better than this. I bought the box and I ate it all, but was not happy. I hope they steal TJ's recipe and try again.;negative
Disappointing: chalky mouth feel, overly sweet taste lacking any complexity.;negative
These were so stale! Ive ordered tons from different companies and these were by far the most stale. Disappointed.;negative
Seven of ten cans were extremely swollen within 6 months even though they had a March 2020 sell by date. Scary.;negative
Tastes disgusting, didn't notice any boost in energy. At $1 a pop, a total scam and an expensive habit.;negative
Definitely not the taste I was expecting, we had to give it away because it has a strong minty flavor, not mango or peach.;negative
"I used this to make ice cream and it caused the ice cream to have a ""dirt"" flavor.  It smelled wonderful, but when I tasted one, it tasted like dirty anise.  Will not buy again.";negative
Honestly not impressed at all.  Their milk chocolate bar was far better but it may be because I'm not a huge fan of white chocolate.  Bar is hard , not very creamy.;negative
This was a major disappointment in terms of the quality of the product. The seller was very good but the product is vile tasting. It is impossible to drink.;negative
These mints have a really strange aftertaste.  I do not like them at all!;negative
Usually LOVE this brand, but not this flavor. Coconut tasted weird.;negative
very dry and some were bitter tasting;negative
I like the Illy capsules very much as a whole. This one tastes like not very good decaf.;negative
Poor taste, I am sad I bought a whole box only to not like them. :/;negative
Candy was old and melted to the wrappers. Not to happy about not being able to return for another bag, this one even had an expiration date of 05/2017.;negative
Disappointed in this coffee. Weak !;negative
Tough.  Tasteless.  Pricey.  Better brand available for pulled pork but too expensive on third-party sellers on Amazon.  Do not recommend.;negative
The best chili ever, but the cost of this is not worth it. My own recipe does the trick.;negative
I wanted to bad to like these but I just can't. Weird texture, weird flavor. Nothing like a real cheese flavor at all.;negative
thought I try something different didn't like a all it tasted nasty will not order again slow service alsowill not recommend;negative
"There is no way I could choke down this product.  I think the texture is disgusting.  It reminded me of squid.

JMHO";negative
This was a great disappointment.  I didn't relize it has turmeric in it and the flavors are not good.  It turns the soup an ugly yellow and had an awful taste.  We threw the soup away.;negative
Used to get these all the time until I closely monitored glucose, which really raised.;negative
There is a nasty smell/taste. My dogs wouldn't drink from them so I tried it and realized why. They don't leak though.;negative
No Flavor at all. WHat a disappointment.;negative
I thought it might be good in coffee. Didn't like it at all.;negative
Not sealed well, have some that are still looking fresh, some that are dead color. They all looked like they are air tight. 2-3 weeks received.;negative
Not at all like the Stella D'Oro Cookies that I used to buy. These are very dry, and lacking flavor. I would not recommend these.;negative
"TOO SWEET -LIKE THE BOLT CHEWS BETTER
DIDN'T GET MORE ENERGY JUST FATTER.";negative
It was extremely bland. Just did not have a stronger coffee flavor, which is what I prefer.;negative
Does NOT work with 2.0 machines! What a waste of money. :(;negative
It never has had one flower on it.  It has no buds.  The one I had before bloomed constantly except for 2 weeks in January.  I'm throwing this one out.;negative
Really gross chemicals smoked aftertaste.  Lasted too long!;negative
Not as good as other curry powders used.;negative
Two of us tried these and didn't like them. They tasted bitter. Couldn't eat them plain, so I made almond butter out of them, and that was no good either. Ended up throwing them away.;negative
Like another reviewer wrote, this item is shipped frozen -- not a fresh item.;negative
After reading some of the comments about this coffee we gave it a try. Sorry to say we found it bitter. Needless to say we will not be purchasing this one again. However. the regular Caribou coffee is good.;negative
bottle cap won't come off, called them, they said a common problem.;negative
has no taste and will not order again;negative
Hard and like a piece of cardboard in your mouth. Very little taste to them.;negative
I was expecting a sweet chili flavor and it tasted more like sweet curry to me.;negative
Did not enjoy does not taste as described.;negative
These are spicey but they are dry and chewy tough.  I like the brand but these seemed old.;negative
get the pecan [which I have ordered several times in the past] - this stuff tastes like soda pop - I would return it if I hadn't ground it all and then threw it in the trash - color disappointing...;negative
Was not pleased with this at all. It wasn't sealed properly, and I felt uncomfortable using this. For the price, i felt ripped off!!!;negative
My bag was completely full of dark oily nuts. Even the critters that come to my feeder didn't eat them. Don't know if all are like that. Mine was.;negative
This is a very small amount of garlic powder in a plastic bag. I did not even smell the garlic very strong. When the garlic powder arrived the box was mushed flat. I will not order this product again.;negative
Disappointing. Very hard and tough. Cheaper beans from Aldi's or supermarket are much better.;negative
I did not expect it to be this bad.  I don't really have anything good to say about it other than it is sweet.  Mix with cocoa and ground hazelnuts if you want to give it any flavor.;negative
red and green are good.  orange doesn't taste good;negative
"This candy has a strange taste,very hard to explain kinda like chemical no very little mint.
I would not recommend this candy.";negative
Tastes like nothing. I love Miso soup (which is why i bought this) and I've bought Miso paste before. Am I maybe missing an ingredient that makes Miso actually taste good?;negative
I think I need to stick to lemon, lime and other fruit juices. This item was too syrupy and artificial tasting to me.;negative
Gift a little stale n didn't care for after taste so wouldn't order again n try to remember that for next year;negative
Even though the size was posted, I didn't realize how tiny the jars would be. That was my fault, but I usually love everything Thai and am dreading having to finish leftovers. It was not yummy.;negative
Cans came thrown in a box and dented!;negative
Is an ok  oil, very little olive oil taste (none of the peppery taste I like) and pale color. I don't think this is pure olive oil at all but a blend.;negative
I love this brand but the last bag was very off tasting. So bad I had to throw it away. I hope the next order is back to excellence , if not I have to try another brand;negative
I DID NOT GET COLA! THE CAN SAID COLA BUT IT WAS A 7UP LIKE DRINK.;negative
All cans in the case were dented, some severely.;negative
"Didn't like this PapaNicholas flavor at all, for me or my teenager.  Too ""burnt"".";negative
No fault of the seller but these were the worst tasting cookies I have ever had threw the rest of themway;negative
Too much work for me!  I had a hard time getting them all evenly popped and a lot of them were too hard  to chew. Not a fan!;negative
"I opened up the bag and take a tiny piece to taste, because it didn't look delicious. it tasted horrible!
it is soooo salty and it doesn't taste like anything, just salty!!  I threw a whole bag!!";negative
Pops into about a third of the volume the same amount of Orville Redenbacher popcorn does.  Hopefully the not-light, not-fluffy, tough alternative is not what we're forced to in order to avoid GMOs, etc.;negative
totally diappointed, I had to refrigirate it after opening and there's nothing much you can do with a hard oil, besides cooking.;negative
No nutrient info, no product origin. And cannot find any information regarding to this product in the USDA organic certification website, is that label even real?;negative
Has MSG and SUGAR. I didn't do my homework on this one had to throw this away and literally 20.00 down the trash. :(;negative
In my opinion, it is too close to eating air.  Too pricey for very little value, no nutrition to speak of.  What you get is texture and little else.  The apple and pear taste ok, do not like the citrus.;negative
The Macadamias were not as expected, the nuts looked discolored and old, and they didn't look edible to me.;negative
What a joke. Two pretzels, two graham crackers, five truffles, and 2 oz of coffee for 70 bucks.  I am the sucker.  You beware.;negative
All you taste is the jalapeos, you cant'n taste the corn bread. Heavy and dry! Will return, must stick to gluten free.;negative
Not very peppery and It take a lot to get the flavor.;negative
I didn't check the sell-by date on the carton and have thrown the rest away because they were partially spoiled.  Buy these at your local market and check the sell-by date.  Return if old. Boo!;negative
Not a fan of this like I am of the coffee.;negative
This didn't work in my keurig coffee maker. Disappointed because the idea of honey tea was great;negative
Meh. Nongshim Black is much better.;negative
This taste really bad. Strong artificial sweetener after taste.;negative
they taste stale I was disappointed;negative
the candy was old and stale and very hard. Walnettos are a very soft and easy to chew candy normally.;negative
I cant sleep when I drink this, probably the caffeine;negative
I had to give this product away, it was way to spicy HOT....I even tried rinsing it, but it was still to spicy.;negative
"Tasteless
U need to use alot to tast a little bit of it.";negative
The hazelnuts were rancid right out of the bag. Very disappointing.;negative
Most of the pasta was broken upon arrival.  They fall apart easier than traditional lasagna noodles but since I am avoiding wheat it is an option.  Best to buy in the store where you can avoid broken pieces.;negative
The package was broken and the cornmeal was everywhere;negative
There was very little filling in them, I most certainly would not buy them again;negative
Didn't taste fresh enough for me, but it wasn't horrid or anything.;negative
Gives me an upset stomach, my Husband to so its not just me, This tea is wierd, I actually threw up after 1 cup !! Funny thing tho, It taste good !! So Idk;negative
Unfortnately tastes burnt and weak, only drink when out of everything else, really bad taste from the whole batch of k cups;negative
Poor review because I do not like crunchy.;negative
Good chocolate, very low coffee taste . One does not know what to expect, so you take a risk each time;negative
Oh no! These expired four months ago!;negative
Don't order these bananas,  they come very green and never ripen.;negative
"Unless you really really really like vinegar - AVOID! Those chips should have been called ""Vinegar and Sea Salt"" - not ""Sea Salt and Vinegar"".";negative
I tried several flavors of this and they all tasted like plastic or something else inedible.  I threw them out.;negative
Torula yeast and yeast extract are as bad as MSG!!!  I can't tolerate either.;negative
did not lower my glycemic level at all. (im still pre diabetic) tastes good tho;negative
Too expensive for delivery and 1/4 of the water in each jug doesn't make it.;negative
I don't think I like it. It's very bland;negative
Bought this to use as a sugar substitute. Made brownies couldn't eat them. This stuff leaves an intense cooling feeling in your mouth like menthol or peppermint does and I really disliked that.;negative
Was hoping of a more raspberry flavor but I'll have to say I am not a fan. The black tea ruins it for me;negative
This just tastes like plain mint tea. Very unhappy.;negative
"60% of fortune cookies are broken,
Better to get at a store.";negative
gritty and the taste was not the greatest;negative
"Strong ginger flavor, lots of dehydrated ginger pieces. Feel the ""heat"" of ginger when drinking.";negative
Very disappointed. Not worth the Cost at all!;negative
I was disappointed with this product. Tastes more like lemonade than a margarita. The only plus is it's a low carb mix and those are hard to find.;negative
"The coffee is not available.  So, although it is on subscription, it is out of stock and not available.  Very discouraging.  Guess I will need to go to the grocery store and find ""something"".";negative
Over priced and you can find GHEE for more quantity, better quality and better price. Rip off!!;negative
Kashi has changed the formula. This tastes nothing like the original almond filled bar.;negative
I wanted to give this to someone for a gift. The Amazon both was perfect. The Starbucks canister was dented in 3 places & powder was leaking out. Will hv to keep for myself.;negative
palm oil is carcinogenic etc etc etc;negative
I don't like the flavor at all. I honestly prefer Hersheys special dark cocoa powder.  This tastes bitter and weird and leaves my food tasting not chocolate-y;negative
Looks good but is very thin and flimsy.;negative
"UPDATE: newer tea is blant. Had to switch to one in metal tin or use two of these ((( no buy!

Tastiest tea I tried. Tasted in starbucks and ordered for my home. Loved by guests too";negative
Requires two packets to supply ample taste. Quite a few of those packets were congealed into clumps that were difficult to dispense into my water and took long to dissolve.;negative
This is not a pack of 24. Only received a single bottle. deceptive labeling. Size is only 8 oz, not 14 oz.;negative
Bottles are almost impossible to open, but when you do...tastes like crap!;negative
Horrible  needed twice as much mix as requested;negative
Not the best maca I've had.  Hurt my stomach.;negative
Mostly cereal. Definitely not filled like the picture.;negative
The only thing good about this coffee is that it is cheap and organic.  Very bland tasting.  I've had to grind it finer and use more coffee than usual.;negative
Disgusting. Taste horrible. Like weak soda with salt added.;negative
Not very good. Have to use a lot of this! The walmart brand is actually way better than this one. Won't be ordering this one again :(;negative
Almost gaged.  Although texture and creamy filling not so bad, I was greatly disappointed.  Using a candy bar as the standard, I will never buy these again.  However, to each their own.;negative
Taste like salt water. I couldn't finish a box. Nasty tasty. Stick to Goya cOconto water;negative
My children hate the complex flavors.;negative
I love vegan jerky but the taste and texture here are funky.;negative
These have an old smelling taste ,,,For the cost u think they would sell new ?;negative
VERY DISAPPOINTED!!! Each K-cup was DIRTY!!! Have never seen anything like this!!!;negative
This was such a small portion. It wouldn't satisfy a toddler. Wouldn't buy again.;negative
The product I received was not very good. There are clumps in the drink rather than being smooth. I'm not sure if their storage method might be why, but I'll be buying elsewhere from now on.;negative
I admit, I am a Jiff girl.....but I purchased this after seeing it on o.  I just didn't like it....to make sure I tried it on 2 different occasions...I guess its just not for me.;negative
The flavor of this tea was not very good in my opinion. It also did not work at all for me so I will not be purchasing this again in the future!;negative
Didn't like it, is too thick for my taste;negative
I thought it was two bags, it was a total rip off for one bag;negative
Tastes pretty bad - added one tablespoon of the stuff to a cup of Keurig coffee only thing it added was an unpleasant oily taste.;negative
"The toffee that I received was clearly past it's prime. Instead of the usual soft and creamy texture; this toffee was dried out. So disappointing!";negative
Once the nozzles one theese boxes were opened, the box was damaged under the cap base, and woukd leak.  Also, shaking this to mix dis not make the consistency or flavor any better.;negative
Eh. Too salty, not smokey enough. We used Rachael Rays and liked that better.;negative
Did not care for this one. It seemed rather weak and not very flavorful. Not a product I would recommend nor re-order.;negative
I am not impressed with any of the Grove Squared products I have ordered.  There is a funny after taste to this product. To me it was a waste of money and I will not be buying again...;negative
A lot of the marshmallows were melted into globs. I cannot recommend these.;negative
"Not a fan of the taste; not as chipotle-ish as other things I've had.";negative
Not fresh at all. Lots of dark brown. Nothing like the picture. Will not buy again.;negative
"Has a bizarre aftertaste, like artificial marshmallows.

Will not be buying again.";negative
This tea smells like peppermint when you open the bag but after it is brewed it does not taste good.  I will not be ordering again.;negative
NO iodine which is why I ordered this salt!  I hope no one orders this--perhaps it is healthy but it contains no iodine.;negative
Way too expensive for the garbage in this kit.;negative
Very very salty. So salty you can't but put a gentle shake on your food.;negative
I did not like the flavor or lack there of.;negative
These used to be really good but they changed the flavour.  The peanut sauce is terrible and not very peanutty.  The noodles are bit cardboardy.  I won't be buying these again.;negative
These also have slipped quite a bit in strength and the quality of the flavor.  I won't be ordering again.;negative
this juice tastes terrible bitter and sour!!! also, it goes bad quickly with lots of precipitate...;negative
The nuts arrived as dry as bones. Crumble when bite into them.;negative
exploded cups in shipment leaked over everything- huge mess;negative
It's ok. Got three boxes and got sick of it.;negative
They came sticky and chewy and stuck do bad to the wrapper each time we ate one it really was to bad because the flavor was good, I just wish they were hard like regular suckers.;negative
not as good as the strawberry ones. the chocolate flavoring was off. wouldn't recommend or buy again. banana flavor was ok;negative
not sure if they ok on the paleo diet.  not made in the USA;negative
There was only 3 packs of crackers in each box. The boxes indicate 4 packs of crackers.;negative
Shouldn't of gotten the cashew ones. I love the almond ones though!!!;negative
"Actually it was pretty disgusting.  Did not taste like any mango I've ever had. There was an after taste that was sharp and
chemical.";negative
Apple flavor is pretty good, but Banana tastes medicinal.;negative
do not like it --taste chewy --not what I was expecting;negative
Mostly bits and pieces, no real whole cashews.;negative
Yuck...didn't like these at all! Thought they'd be like other red licorice,but they are not. Really strange taste,really strange texture.;negative
This dark roast is a medium roast of a poor quality bean. High acid, no body at all, astringent. The coffee equivalent of expecting Monica Belucci but Gwyneth Paltrow shows up instead.;negative
Why are these not organic?  Not vegan if not organic.  No, thank you!;negative
I gave it away !! they left the skins on the tomatoes !;negative
Horrid taste.  I am all for healthy and wanted to like these but.........You can imagine and fill in the blank yourself;negative
Overpriced and didn't whip up the way I expected.;negative
Very bitter, matcha should be slightly sweet with a smooth mouth feel. I will throw this on the shelf only to be used in desperate times.;negative
The flavor is a bit weak and tastes more like burnt coffee than chocolate. There are notes of raspberry but not as strong as I'd like. I definitely won't be buying this again.;negative
Good quality peanuts but way too many craacked shells. Both squirre and blue jays want solid shells -don't tell me how much i must write, please;negative
Poor taste and too grainy. No thanks.;negative
Not a rich or strong enough flavor.;negative
"These do not taste good.  Tried one, didn't like it. Gave them to my son, who eats just about anything and he didn't even like them.

Definitely will not buy again.";negative
This taste ok. Not worth the cost. You can buy better coffee for much less money.;negative
Not good.  I love Jolly Time butter popcorn.  This stuff simply isn't very good.  I threw most of it away.;negative
Didn't do anything for me.  Followed instructions and did not increase my milk at all. gave up on it.  grateful didn't pay ridiculous price for it;negative
Looked great for about a week then the leaves fell off and center stalk got mushy like a rotten sweet potato. The second plant I got did just fibe and is thriving. Have reviewed that separately.;negative
It was okay. Felt like I had to use a lot more vs normal creamer. Trying to give to others away so I don't have to use. Plus had to use more stevia than normal too.;negative
Just taste like regular flavored coffee to me .  Nothing gourmet tasting at all .  Would not buy again  .;negative
I'm sorry to say that these raw cashews are awful! Soooo mushy and tasteless. Very disappointed. I see now that they can't be returned either. Sad!;negative
Fizz beyond control! I don't think the carbonation adds to the enjoyment of the drink. I 'm sold out on BAI drinks but for me the carbonation is a detractor.;negative
I love chocolate so I added this chocolate extract to coffee and all I can say is the taste was very unpleasant. I hope to get better results when I use it in baked products.;negative
Had a bitter aftertaste I wasn't expecting.  This went to the work kitchen to see if others would use it;negative
Normally this is a trusted brand but within 3 days the greens started to decompose. Threw out half to keep the rest from going bad ;negative
Hard, stale, broken into jagged pieces;negative
This coffee does not have a deep rich robust flavor. It has a very acid taste to it and lacks a great deal of depth. I will be switching back to my Kick Ass 454 roast.;negative
I love ginger...but this one is waaay too sweet. I ended up giving it away.;negative
I thought I would try this as it received good reviews.  It is not nearly as flavorful as the almond butter I usually buy and will not purchase it again.  I do not recommend this.;negative
I have but one word for this soup: Yuck!;negative
I was really surprised after reading the reviews to see how horrible the taste of this is....terrible....I couldn't get past the 2 sips. There's got to be a better way to detox.;negative
they all taste wierd - not like fruit - so I'd never purchase this product again.;negative
Would not buy this again.  Went by the reviews and they are wrong.  This is very bitter coffee.  I will go back to Illy coffee, much better coffee!  This was a waste of money.  It went in the garbage.;negative
Save your money these are over hyped;negative
Should have paid attention to other reviewers.  Item arrived melted to us too.;negative
This mocha syrup sure didn't taste like any mocha I've ever had. It had a weird flavor and left a bad aftertaste.;negative
The flavor was disappointing and the texture too. Not a fan.;negative
Doesn't taste the same as the Mexican Vanilla I get from other sources;negative
No way as good as homemade.  Very quick and ez.  But requires alot of butter, almost 1/2 cup.  End product was dry.;negative
"I've had the lemon juice and liked it. My low review is based on getting 2 shipments that had not been stored properly and were spoiled.

I'm not sure I'll take a chance again.";negative
Oh my gosh, there is so much better chocolate in the world.  The best is Callebaut Belgium chocolate.  This does not even come close.;negative
"Was ""tucked into"" my Gerbs products...and when I got it home, I found it's full of artificial colors/dyes and dioxins...
NOT What I was looking to buy...at all!!  Nasty!";negative
Low quality beans used in this product. the fact that is organic and BPA free is good but it is not a high quality it is too hard.;negative
Not as smooth as their other variants;negative
"most of these are strange tasting; I only like two or three flavors, so most of this package was a waste to me.";negative
This product cannot be returned if you find it defective in any way.  Buyer beware.  It is not Kosher.;negative
See just plain awful review of Lipton Super Fruit Tea!;negative
This was delicious, however the chaos in my gut has been incredible.  I'm still sick two days later.  Next time I'll just eat sugar.;negative
Kind of tasted gross, to be honest. I wanted something to add crunchiness to my mac and cheese, but they got soggy like 2 minutes after i mixed them in;negative
These cost $2.00 from the grocery store!  No reason to buy online if you have access to a grocery store...;negative
Was yellow upon first opening it- which means rancid. Super disappointing.;negative
I have ordered this before and it was perfect, but this second one is very watery... not sure if it has been diluted with something... ;negative
Good produce, but it is overpriced.;negative
We did not realize there was soon much sugar in these.  May as well eat a candy bar! Lesson learned, will look at labels more closely.;negative
Only used for pancakes. Tastes nasty. Maybe better for other uses.;negative
maybe not a fair review .... arrived soaking wet ... your new ice packs are awful with a tendency to leak;negative
greasy turkey that falls apart into pieces, just buy regular pepperoni, it tastes much better than this;negative
This stuff sure is different. The spices are good, the texture is kind of rubbery. I'm not crazy about it. I just never tried haggis before and wanted to give it a shot.;negative
Yuck. Unpleasant sour and bitter flavor. And gives coffee a grainy texture.;negative
Disgusting, tried giving it away to friends and got dirty looks after they tried it. STAY AWAY.;negative
very difficult to cook stays gritty in the center.  had to have it ground further;negative
Not good at all. Tasted like anise.;negative
I'm sorry , I'm sure it's not the brand and nothing to do with the seller but this is the most bitter herbal tea I ever tasted. Even after adding honey to it, I just couldn't stand it.;negative
Very disappointed with this purchase. Not serving these to guests over the holidays as the quality is not good despite use by date of Oct. 2018.  If you want fresh pistachios shop elsewhere.;negative
Not very tasty, to be honest. These are not the real deal. Better find imported flageolet beans :(((;negative
"I thought this would be mostly BBQ pork but it is mostly potato chunks, beans, and liquid.  Note that the word ""soup"" is in small print. Sorry I bought 12.  Never again.";negative
These pop tarts taste nasty.  There is too much of some kind of flavoring.  Sorry, I just threw them away and I had purchased a lot of them.  Just a big waste of money.;negative
Tiny box of hard cookies/biscuits. I would never buy this again.;negative
Taste was weak. Had to use a lot of tea bags to get any flavor.;negative
Disgusting. Fake sour patch kids. Who knows what's really in them.;negative
These were stale and they didn't retain much flavor.  It was a waste of money.;negative
This shipment of milk is all liquid. Will not solidify after refrigeration.;negative
Trashing after trying to eat since January;negative
This is a high-quality product. I've just realized I'm not an Oolong fan. Great transaction, though. If you like Oolong, this tea will be great for you.;negative
Gross how can anyone tolerate this? Pill form is much better. It's not for me.;negative
These peanuts were stale and are hard as a rock. I would not recommend these to anyone .Looks like very poor quality control and Kirkland is dropping the ball on this product.;negative
The whole idea behind these pods is good. However, the truth is: you really need two pods to get the desired darkness/strength that most people like. There goes your savings over other systems.;negative
Hard and discolored will not buy from this seller again very unhappy;negative
I use Millert to make congee all the time but this one totally different texture, taste like mortar. Tossed it.;negative
Did not like the taste or texture of these at all;negative
The bread was stale and hard when I received it.  Warming did not help.  Would not purchase again.;negative
most bobo bars are moist and very soft, the almond bars are always dry and hard to get down.;negative
Not good. Not creamy like I had remembered them. No-one takes more after trying them. Not recommended.;negative
Over priced for the quality of coffee.;negative
"I WAS BUYING THIS THINKING OF REAL DRIED FRUIT BUT IT WAS NOT !!!

& IT DID NOT TASTE LIKE CANDY OR CHIPS

THAT WAS AWFUL SNACK FOR ME & WASTE OF MONEY";negative
This batch had colored wrappers instead of black. Have nasty perfumey taste. I think they're fake;negative
Very misleading on the amount of protein. Its about the size of a small chip bag for kids.;negative
The whole bag was but and prices and crumbs. It must have been dropped ..... repeatedly;negative
Bitter and the bottle tends to get plugged up with sweetener crystals easily.  Need to redesign container they come in.;negative
The packaging was terrible. The chips were all broken. The individual bags had been dumped in a large box without any bubble pack or air puffs to protect them.;negative
"Not the taste I was expecting; very generic flavor.";negative
I expected this soup to be good but no it's not good don't waste your money in this the noddles are really chewy not good the taste of the soup don't even taste like miso soup not good :/;negative
Well.... It's seaweed! Lol I thought they were like seaweed crackers.. They're simple thinly dried salted seaweed. I have to figure out how to use them... In the meantime my dogs love them haha.;negative
Did not care for the taste as well as other brands.  Also there was always a residue at the bottom of the cup as I was finishing the tea.;negative
I can taste it in coffee. Will use it in cooking, but not coffee.;negative
I purchased two flavors and these taste very stale.  I'm not sure if it's the batch or this particular type.;negative
Open box noodles all over when it arrived.;negative
Way too gooey and sticky. Not the same firm texture as normal Twizlers. Really not edible, sticks to every tooth.;negative
My daughter did not like it at all it taste nastey;negative
"My husband agrees, but he did say ""regular soy sauce plus a slight second taste.""  Either way, might as well just buy soy sauce.";negative
no taste , when I soak these in hot water they do not have any taste, others that I buy infuse the water with a great porcini taste for rice or sauce and then I chop them up and add to the rice or gravy;negative
Aroma in ingredient list. Wasnt shown in the ingredients on the amazon page. The salt itself appears to be bleached table salt. I don't plan to eat this;negative
Awful tea This taste so bad made me sick;negative
This Easter Grass isn't edible. It doesn't taste good at all.;negative
No flavor that I ,or my wife and friends, could taste.;negative
I expected full sized half Georgia pecans. They were not!  Will not purchase again.;negative
I'm impressed with the packaging but not so much with the low quantity in the chips counting per bag. Okay flavor.;negative
Too sweet for our taste. While I like Annie's for snacks, pasta etc. this was just too much! Even my kid passed on this in favor of other fruit snacks, I tried it out and pretty much got an instant toothache!;negative
The lid came off in shipping and I was unable to use this product.;negative
"These don't work in my keurig 2.0
Here it is thanksgiving and I have to go to the store to buy coffee.";negative
Tiny portion, came wilted, old and half brown;negative
"There's a very high sodium content. A can (forget about bogus serving info of 3.5 per can) is about 90% of an adult male's sodium ""allowance."" You can smell the salt when you open the can!";negative
nothing special and they go stale very fast. I would not repurchase;negative
I HAVE BEEN GETTING ALOT OF BAD CUPS.  THEY WOULDN'T FUNCTION LIKE THEY SHOULD.  I GAVE UP ON KEURIG CUPS.  TOO EXPENSIVE ANYWAY.;negative
I know Bulletproof is high quality but this hit chocolate just taste week and bad. In addition it's lumpy.;negative
Not the mint chutney from Indian restaurants. Oily, vinegary flavor, inedible. Avoid.;negative
I have only cooked one batch. They melted.;negative
flavor is ok, texture is pretty awful;negative
I was very disappointed with this coffee. VERY WEAK IN FLAVOR!;negative
Turned rancid after being opened a few days.  Bad taste too!;negative
Does not work in my Keurig 2.0.  It recognizes that this is not a K Cup;negative
"HORRIBLE!
The noodle is passable, same as the one in shin ramyun
The soup base, however, is like expired soy sauce with MSG.
Vegetable package is getting smaller and smaller...
Avoid!";negative
Why do these have to be split in half to use? PITA and a half are too weak and a whole cube is too much. I'll stick the powered bouillon.;negative
Tastes weird.  Nothing watermelon-ish about it at all.  Will not buy again.  This is the opinion of 3 different people tasting all these flavors of honey stix with me.;negative
Dry, i can't eat them, kids spat them out. So out to the birds they go. Waste of money.;negative
Very good Milka I find it a bit to expensif I can get Ritter Sport here. Need to get better pricing.;negative
I love the Better Than Pasta shirataki, as well as the ones I get at our local grocery store, so I was surprised when I really didn't like this. They are really slimy tasting. I wouldn't buy them again.;negative
Good quality, and like that it's organic...but the taste, for me, is very bad.  Tried it in drip coffee maker and french press, and it is not good.  Smells pretty good, but the taste is quite off putting.;negative
Taste is fine, but too few cinnamon sticks in the bottle. Eight skinny sticks, about half full. Not much for the price.;negative
not crunchy soft no taste ...I have had much better puffed rice...;negative
I could not believe how bland and distasteful this product was.  It tastes like PURE WATER and has no flavor at all... does not taste like cider as advertised.  WHat a waste.. just had to throw em all out :(;negative
Too sweet with an artificial aftertaste.  Stevie would be a tastier choice. Disappointing.;negative
This is so far not to good. I only tried it once because it made me sick to my stomach. Will try one more time and make sure I have eaten first.;negative
Too much salt! I think it has the content of a salt mine in that tiny bowl.;negative
It has fake sugar which is harder for the body to process. When I purchased this I did not realize it had 20% iodine (I'm deathly allergic to shell fish) and couldn't figure out why I was getting sick.;negative
What a joke. This is a rather small portion and not worth $17.99!;negative
I DON'T LIKE OATMEAL. I TRIED TO EAT IT FOR THE HEALTH BENIFITS BUT JUST CAN'T STAND THE STUFF.;negative
Cherry was very stale.  Other two we're fine.;negative
Was it supposed to be moldy or were those green spots for flavor? I couldn't even eat half of one before I noticed the mold. I had to throw the rest away.;negative
I have ordered these two different times and both times they were stale. No more for me.;negative
"This did not live up to the stone ground taste/texture I have come to enjoy.  I could get more flavor (but not texture) from ""regular"" grits. Very disappointed.";negative
Very disappointing. No apparent Lavender or Honey in this tea. Tea tasted and smelled of Sage with a hint of Mint.;negative
I didn't care for the taste of these. They had a funny bitter taste.;negative
Terribly tough ~ Popped in microwave and stove top ~ Same results ~ Small kernels, no fluff ~ Bought four bags and tossed three / Sad;negative
This is the worst coffee I have ever purchased and is made for coffee weaklings!  No taste and very little aroma.  I will never order this again.;negative
They expired the day before I received them;negative
These I would never buy again knowingly.  I thought I was buying the right brand.  They were like half-cooked raw dough.;negative
These beans are decent but the company should include the fact that they are from CHINA in bigger letters in the description.;negative
the bread had mold on it after just 4 days, so i must have gotten mine close to expiration;negative
Taste like nastiness. I can't even describe. Wait, like a fake candy-like weirdness flavor? It doesn't taste like a true white chocolate AT ALL.;negative
bacon cheddar and buffalo flavors I did not like the cheesy jalapenno was pretty good;negative
This was a light coffee with a decent but not great taste. I drank it, but would not purchase again.;negative
They taste like coconut flakes with a dusting of -- something? Not what I expect veggie bacon bits to taste like!;negative
TASTE IS TERRIBLE, NOT FIT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION,OVER PRICED!;negative
drank this for a few weeks, then started getting weird side effects.. stopped drinking it and now back to normal;negative
"Product not fresh; the expiration date on ALL bags were expired. My expectations were that product would have a shelf life and would be fresh.";negative
Ok, but  vanilla is not my favorite in drinks.;negative
These are hard and not very satisfying. Should have just stuck to the milk chocolate ones. Even the peanut butter is somehow different and not as good.;negative
Taste and texture is between waxpaper and thin rubber.;negative
Don't like the smell or the taste at all. Has no nutritional value at all on the label. Not going to reorder.;negative
Bland, not tart and tastes more like poultry spice than traditional zatar you eat with olive oil and bread. Does not have the wheat filler that other brand have, so that's a positive .;negative
Strange taste, and a bug in the bag!;negative
"This ""bread"" tastes like cardboard. Toasted, grilled,plain or with any topping you could put on it, it still tastes like paper. You can't fake bread.";negative
Really wanted to like this. I like the ingredients but just did not like the cookie.  Would not buy again.;negative
Worst tasting jerky I ever ate. And I love all kinds of jerky.;negative
I did not like this flavor it has a better after taste as well. gave it to my Mom she actually like it.;negative
"Horrible taste, weak coffee. This is a true ""miss"" for me.";negative
I usually love the flavor god seasonings but this one did not impress me at all;negative
The oolong flavor wasn't what I expected compared to several other oolong teas I've had. I've tasted much better.;negative
Package expires over a year from now, but the freshly opened package contains stale, rubbery nuts.;negative
Every time I buy PRE meat, it smells weird. I've never gotten sick of it though. It just smells weird and makes my kitchen smell weird for a while. I don't think it's that fresh.;negative
I was not aware that this product has Sucralose. This can cause stomach upset. Ketchup is sweet enough: it does not need added sweetener.;negative
This oil has a strange stale after taste.  I have tried other macadamia nut oil that was much better.  I used it to make mayonnaise.;negative
I love Toffifee, I didn't love Toffifee direct from the U.K.  Did not travel well (all melted).;negative
Stale as all get out. Was like tying to eat wood chips. I was beyond disappointed. Went out & bought some jerky from Walmart - their store brand beats this. Would probably have been good when it was fresh.;negative
The first box of this tea was great, I ordered two more. The 2nd box I opened taste like a straight chemical, completely undrinkable, and I can't return it.;negative
"It was a bit ""salty"" for my taste, however my spouse liked it.";negative
Not a good aloe juice, nor a good coconut juice if you are looking for something that tastes similar to either;negative
It has a slight chemical taste. I'm not sure what that is. I really ended up throwing it away because if I'm going to eat a treat, it's going to be a really awesome treat. I don't know what this stuff was.;negative
"These taste like stale shortbread cookies. Nothing ""Lemony"" about them all. Amazon needs to find a way to ship it's Prime Pantry items without everything getting crushed.";negative
Came promptly but made me nauseous.;negative
Disappointed!!!  Not the same as I remember .......... but what is?????  They were stale!!;negative
horrible , watery, and it has sugar in it, kind of defeats the purpose.;negative
I love Cadbury products, but these candies turned out to be sorely lacking in flavor.  They were kind greasy too, yuck.  I'll never buy this again.;negative
even with my years of experience i could not get these grains to kefir.  do not waste your money.;negative
I did NOT like these figs AT ALL!!  They were dry and hard, and did not taste very good either.  I will not purchase Turkish figs again, and cannot recommend any one to purchase these.;negative
BEWARE!!! These are advertised as Sconza brand.  I love Sconza brand and these weren't even close.;negative
It is not green but yellow. Smelled fine. Tasted fine. Would not purchase again because of the color.;negative
Good, but not great. There's no satisfying chew to the drops and the flavor isn't terribly strong.;negative
I normally buy my pickle garlic from somewhere else. I ordered here and I was disappointed the container was not filled up and the garlic was not that good.;negative
Arrived spoiled. Mostly damaged olives that were mushy with a putrid smell. Wish I could return but I made the mistake of opening. Total loss.;negative
Yeeechch.  I hated these.  But apparently my colleagues liked them.  I gave the whole bag to them.;negative
I would not recommend anyone to purchase these cakes.  They crumble really, really bad.  I had to use them as cereal they were so bad.  Will not purchase again.;negative
Got this for my mother who can not have coffee anymore.  She said she'd just rather do without;negative
waste of money!! wish I would have not purchased. way to sweet, and thick and taste like nasty wet sugar;negative
they use the hazardous PPO method to pasteurize.;negative
They should really post the possible side effects on the description. Scared to try it. Not a huge fan of possibly having exploding diarrhea!;negative
I am a diabetic.  This is not a product for a diabetic, but it's hard to tell what the sweetner is when they call it flavorings.;negative
For whatever reason, these had a distinct moldy taste.  I haven't had that before and I didn't care for it at all.  I had to throw the bag away.;negative
Don't waste your money. They are dry and crumbly and taste the same.;negative
Watch out with these. They are for sucking only and if one latches on to a tooth it can and did in my case remove part of the enamal;negative
Nasty.  Not sure why.  We're new to cooking Chinese, but these just tasted bad.  Threw them out.;negative
I was very disappointed with this cookie.  The lemon was so strong and artificial tasting that I through most of them away.;negative
Bitter and grainy.  I rushed to cancel my subscription order for this because I am probably going to throw it away as soon as I buy a replacement.;negative
Just read some of the ingredients and did not care for what I found.;negative
I got this for a couple of guys. I was hoping the flavors and scents would be some kind of bacon but was disappointed.  The visuals were great though!;negative
"I gave them to a friend who has a child who eats Gluten Free food. They didn't like the flavor any more than I did. Safe to eat; but, flavor has somewhat of a chemical aftertaste.";negative
This is not Chinese mustard. This is guildens or some other brand that they called a Chinese mustard, not even close;negative
I love these chips but they arrived open, crushed and chips everywhere. Very displeased .;negative
It was fresh, delivered quickly... And nauseating. Too sweet. We order Happy Hippos all of the time and are big fans of most Kinder items we have ordered, but this is nauseatingly sweet.;negative
This tastes nothing like coffee. I used it in my espresso maker and it didn't turn out well. Perhaps I'll try making lattes with it. It could use a loo watering down!;negative
These are borderline gross. A hint of lime? How about an assault.  The Ranch flavor is outstanding but for some reason they stopped making it.;negative
The seller/brand is great! But these beans, man...they taste like straight up peas. So much no.;negative
Definitely not a good taste, will not rebut this flavor...;negative
These almonds do not taste fresh... at all.  They are more chewy in texture than crunchy like almonds we have bought in the grocery store in the past.  Not happy with these at all.;negative
For the life of me I cant taste any onion in these. Kinda crispy but greasy - I can just feel the grease dispersing in my mouth as I chew. Very broken and crumbly and a little stale.;negative
This gum was a big disappointment, the flavor, the quality and quantity was a major disappointment.  I wouldn't suggest buying it at all.;negative
A hint of burnt rubber makes this tea, well, undrinkable.  I tried brewing this tea at different temperatures, time lengths, even trying cold brew.  They all had the brunt rubber or something taste.;negative
I had purchased this first from another retailer - and LOVED the taste. So being an Amazon fan, I ordered this and it tastes RANCID and they will NOT ALLOW RETURNS. Shame on you!;negative
Had a bland taste.  Was crunchy and didn't get too soggy right away  The shape was odd for cereal too.  Wouldnt' buy again.;negative
Box was crushed but was able to save most of the contents.;negative
This is a good product if the cans are not dented.  I use it when I make my tomato sauce for chili and spaghetti.;negative
The olive oil seemed rancid.  I know I was burping it all day.  I went back to King Oscar and my 'problems' disappeared.;negative
NOT  GOOD..... KIND OF LIKE  A  VERY  WATERED DOWN  DRINK.....NO FLAVOR TO SPEAK OF.......THE GRAPE  IS  TERRIFIC;negative
The quality is great, but the quantity was advertised incorrectly.  I'll order elsewhere, or just wait till I go to the store to buy in bulk.;negative
I wish there were really such a thing as miracle noodles... The texture is just like rubber and I am trying to force myself to like this..;negative
Too much orange & not enough cinnamon. Not for me...;negative
To me, these had no flavor. I had such high hopes but was horribly let down!;negative
what a complete rip off. I got sick eating this product. I would not recommend.to anyone.;negative
most were broken when received useless;negative
Tasty but so overpriced ... not worth it.;negative
The candy pieces came with the shells cracked and off each piece of candy. I couldn't put candy pieces out for company. They looked old. I think I should receive a new bag!;negative
Over priced, too sweet and not enough Chai flavor;negative
"I thought it was in a glass jar.
I was under the impression it was extravirgin. It states virgin on the container.
 Very confusing.";negative
A little bit weak for my tastes, but would probably be good for people that don't want a strong cofee.;negative
It's NOT true lemon pepper. It contains other materials. It has onion and garlic in addition to the black pepper and crystalized lemon. Disappointing that this was not clear in the description.;negative
This is a disappointing purchase.  The lemon peels have been so processed that they have no taste and the chocolate is a very poor quality.  I will no buy this product again;negative
Probably healthy, but hard to use. When it gets wet, it gets slimy. Won't buy it again.;negative
Love the cookies but when I rec'd just today..7/28/16. Nothing but crumbs!!! So disappointed.;negative
Got these today (May 3rd) and they expire May 7th AND they aren't eligible for return! Ridiculous.;negative
It was odd!!! I've eaten several different brands of grain free granola and this was the worst. Bad taste and bad smell,  will not recommend;negative
I was so looking forward to this when I ordered and was really disappointed in the flavor.  Just not an enjoyable oatmeal.;negative
Don't like the taste.  It doesn't come close to the aroma and quality of home made soup.  I was very disappointed and will not buy it again.;negative
It was very dry and I wouldn't recommend it for that reason.;negative
Kinda bland and not really to my liking or taste, but Im sure other would enjoy them. Maybe I just enjoy the sweetness of candy.;negative
Really wanted to like this. Shared some beans with a friend. Two households hated it. Threw the bag away after one cup.;negative
I couldn't drink this tea.  Overpowering.  Perhaps one needs to make a weak batch and go at it that way.  I think the packaging should include beter instructions for proper brewing.;negative
Hard as a rock. Doesn't melt either. It's more like coconut butter (manna). Not milk at all.;negative
I was quite disappointed in the taste, have had Newman's regular coffee but the Decaf didn't have the same flavor.;negative
As soon as we opened the box, we noticed the smell. They were molded. The idea of possible mold being in the sticks is not something we want to risk for ourselves or our kids.;negative
First, I thought my machine was on the fritz. Turns out these KCups don't function very well. All other KCup brands ordered thru Amazon had zero issues. These were consistently problematic. Dont recommend.;negative
Love the honey sticks but arrived with some popped open and got all over the rest. I had one batch unscathed and other ruined. You can't return these if they bust FYI;negative
We need to move away from using so much corn syrup. Although my kids love this stuff, my wife and I are only ordering real maple syrup from now on.;negative
Tastes awful. Like burned toffee. It has rice crisps in it. Very unlike Coffee Crisp bars which are 5+ stars. Coffee Crisp can be found now at some Publix stores. Hurray!;negative
it was ok, but I added coconut milk, sugar and curry powder to make it more flavorful.;negative
Just didn't like the flavor compared to my other organic coffee I buy.  It came out a bit butter. But I am picky on the quality, preparation and quality of my coffee.;negative
"Popped and packaged well (no unpopped kernels, and few broken).  However, the flavor is way too light (subtle).  Needs some ""pop"" (no pun intended.)";negative
Very bitter - odd after taste compared to the brand I used to buy. Not good for use as a sweetener.;negative
this is weak tasting not up to my standards;negative
"Much more watery consistency than I like and is usual.
Plus, I don't really like the taste.

Not recommended.";negative
Cheaply made, weird aftertaste. Would not purchase again.;negative
wrong size. one package was broken. Returned all three;negative
Not for me, but my husband enjoyed the chocolate.;negative
For some reason this is nothing like the Sauce I can get from Nandos or the local store.  Its a different color, different consistency (much more watery) and tastes different.  I won be ordering this again.;negative
I didn't like this tea it was to strong and kind of bitter.;negative
Looked old to me. Package looked crumpled and unappetizing  NEVER AGAIN for tis frugal Dutchman.;negative
I wouldn't recommend this it has a horrible taste and the inhaler is hard to work. Find something else that is easier and better taste.;negative
Can't make the coffee strong enough. I'm sure it's good if you like mellow coffee, but I'm Cajun and grew up on very strong coffee. Will not buy this again.;negative
I bought this as a gift and we have some as well. I find all four of them far too sweet. The sweetness, in fact, covers the other flavors in each of these. I would not buy this again.;negative
Was vacuum packed with a freshness label spanning a month. I received it halfway through that period and it was SPOILED.;negative
They were hard as rocks when they arrived, and when we got into them, they were moldy in the center. I wouldn't get these again.;negative
Go with the Kirkland brand- you won't get pits;negative
I really did not care for the taste;negative
Came to me in pieces.  Really like these biscuits but can't chance getting them in pieces.;negative
Considering it was made out of potatoes....I don't get it, but I tried. Not my cup of tea, may work for other people.;negative
Terrible texture - I'm hoping to  use them in smoothies otherwise I'll have to throw them out.;negative
Out of country beef, does taste weird, so I quit buying.;negative
They were so large that eating them was difficult.;negative
Love the taste, one of the box i got was not fresh. Another box i got this month Feb 2016, not fresh at all. Tastes very old, that's why lowering the rating.;negative
Bought this last year, bitter artificial taste I've been using organic stevia since which is much better;negative
The butterscotch candy is almost flavorless.  I am very disappointed in it's poor quality.;negative
Gross. It's not tasty like i thought it would be.  I enjoy other Califa products, but this tastes bland and bitter. Nothing like I'd expect coconut to taste like.;negative
Smelled  like chicken manure and tasted off. Not my cup of tea.;negative
Not satisfied. Very weak flavor. Would not buy again or recommend.;negative
They are an ok snack, but I'm sure there is a better cheddar cracker out there somewhere.;negative
Not what I expected, the hot chocolate and cappuccinos taste watered down. Not good! When you crave Hot Chocolate you want Hot Chocolate not watered down chock taste. Don't waste your money.;negative
I'm sorry but I did not like this at all.  Ick.;negative
First time buyer of Sourwood honey and I do not like it, at all!  To me it is totally tasteless and I am so disappointed!;negative
I wish I knew it had stevia in it. Stevia and me don't like each other. :/;negative
My husband did not like them. Not what he thought.;negative
I thought the texture to be very gummy and the flavor to be super artificial.  However, my daughter loved it!;negative
A wish the vanilla flavor was a little bit more vanilla E if there is such a word lol Not much taste to it will not order it again;negative
I received this product two days after the 'best used before' date. What a disappointment!;negative
This variety pack is a mix of K cups some can be used in a 2.0 and others can't.  The flavor apple ciders is terrible and doesn't seem to melt very well so my cider was clumpy.;negative
So so quality and too little lemon flavor. Noticed very few lemon peels in this product, as compared with others. Very light viscosity, almost liquid.;negative
The description of this product is incorrect.  I am disappointed as it no longer came with my favorite product the Oatmeal Raisin bars.;negative
Absolutely disgusting!!!!! Couldn't even get my husband to drink it, and he likes everything;negative
Nope never again...got one with a bug in it and , TJ nor manufacturer care much...beware. sealed with a bug in a caramel...ewwww;negative
This sounded so good in the write up, but I found it watery, and couldn't taste the lime or much coconut.  I ended up giving both cases to a friend.;negative
Boosted ones blood sugar like candy, strangely the sea salt ones don't do that.  ???;negative
These cookies look so pretty, but they taste like old dust. So very disappointed I am not even going to serve them. Disgusting.;negative
taste good but hard as a rock. got to heat them up to eat them.;negative
ripped off.  movie theater price.  tastes ok.;negative
I don't know why I ever bought these. Ingredients are poisonous. I will never buy these again.;negative
Grew up consuming much DD caffine, however, this was way too overpowering in that a chemical donut in my java? Not so much.;negative
absolutely tasteless, a waste of money;negative
DELIVERED AHEAD OF SCHEDULE! GREAT PRICE BUT UNFORTUNATELY THIS TEA TASTES AND SMELLS LIKE GRASSY DIRT! WASTE OF MY MONEY. I DO NOT RECOMMEND.;negative
Sorry to say but this is not to my households taste. To be honest it does take somewhat like a Margarita  but perhaps one that has been sitting around after the party is way over.;negative
All that were opened were half as thick as normal. Very chewy-tasted raw. Got a refund. Won't order again.;negative
I like these.  Just the right amount of salt on them and they are rather tasty.  Unfortunately they quadrupled the price now :(;negative
thought it was too expensive for small amount of honey;negative
I WAS VERY DISAPOINTED, I EXPECTED A BETTER QUAILTY FROM HORMEL. I ATE BETTER FOOD OUT OF CANS WHEN I WAS IN THE ARMY AND OUT IN THE BOONIES;negative
Plain plastic bage not labelled so you have no idea what is in it!  Not so cool.;negative
The cookies arrived in crushed into crumbs.  The crumbs were very tasty, but I want cookies, not crumbs.  I don't think it was the packaging, so maybe there is just too much shaking in the delivery?;negative
This coffee is extremely weak and the added flavoring for the Creme Brulee is weak also.  Not worth trying.;negative
Nicely packaged but I did not like it at all. Extremely weak tea and almost flavorless. I would not recommend this. Sorry I bought it.;negative
"I didn't care for it and way to expensive to buy if I did like it.  It ruined the taste
of my oatmeal.";negative
Causes acid reflux. Too bad that the box is HUGE. Friends don't like the spicy taste. So I am stuck with a HUGE amount of these weird chews.;negative
I thought Buddha teas were great except for their packaging.  You want marshmallow root that is loose and perfect?  Go to Mountain Rose Herbs.  The difference is amazing!;negative
i always loved Singapore Street noodles, bUT this is much too hot (spicy), even in Singapore unless you ask to make it hot hot, they don't serve that hot. i regret i ordered this bunch. sorry.;negative
Poor cherry flavor at best..was very disappointed in general..save your money..;negative
I could detect neither a flavor of spices nor a good taste of tea. Very disappointing. I'd return it if I could.;negative
Company description far, far exceeds the actual results. Drank 3 cups & gave away the rest.;negative
Never saw any benefits to replacing it with regular water is it flavorless;negative
"Taste great but waay too expensive due to what I assume is shipping costs.
It would be much better if it was available as a syrup that you can add to soda water.";negative
I've had better. Probably won't be purchasing it again;negative
Didn't like the taste it had a different taste but smelled good;negative
Always wanted to try blue mountain coffee. Not sure if it was cause of the k cups, or brand but wasn't impressed. Brewed weak with no clear notes of any unique flavor.;negative
big jar, but can taste a difference.  older.;negative
I did not like this product, it tasted to starchy for me.;negative
Melted into the packages. Don't order chewy candy or chips from Prime Pantry.;negative
"Not to happy with this purchase.  Weren't past , use by, date but tasted old. to thick and almost chewy.

Live and learn.  Tossed them rest out";negative
I personally did not like these but my husband did.;negative
None of the boxes had the directions to making jams and jellies in them. All they had was a packet of pectin in the boxes. All off them. Maybe that is why they were discounted. I just thought you should know.;negative
These are not true dry roasted peanuts. They have other unnecessary ingredients. The corn starch is more than likely from GMO corn. I gave them away.;negative
This seasoning doesn't have the flavor mixture that makes fajitas take good.  Seems to have a bitter taste to it, but maybe I don't know how fajitas are supposed to taste.;negative
We miss regular graham crackers  and are pleased that we found a substitue that is wheat free. They are good and we enjoy them.;negative
Not to my taste. Way too sweet. I was disappointed as I hoped to find a sauce better than I can make myself.;negative
Damaged container...had to dispose of it...could not use it.;negative
had a weird aftertaste, not something i would ever recommend. i'd rather have the authentic dish.;negative
Arrived stale, made even worse by trying to make health rice puff treats. Expensive too. A disaster all around.;negative
I've tried other similar products and loved them.  I've tried two packet - thinking that I had too much water the first time.  Nope, nasty.;negative
I didn't use it for cooking. I tried to use it to moisturize my hair. It wasn't worth it, so I won't buy again. It just sat on my hair and that's about it.;negative
"As noted regarding other McVities I ordered.  Taste was okay, but cam crumbled and
broken in pieces.

Would never order again!";negative
This is the worst coffee I've had in quite a while.  Don't waste your money.;negative
Do not order in summer time will arrive squished and melted;negative
Tough and chewy, I was disappointed with the quality although they were relatively inexpensive.;negative
these don't have much flavor. there were no cinnamon pieces in my bag.;negative
Not fresh should be in the trash.  I have unfiltered by colvita and there is no comparison this stuff is unusable.;negative
Not particularly good.  The Key Lime flavor was off and the texture wasn't up to the standards of the chocolate flavors.  I won't buy this again.;negative
"Strong coconut smell. It's very ""goopy"" even when stored in a cool place. I'll use it as I'm not wasteful, but I won't get it again.";negative
Too many buts fie me but great tasting;negative
Bag was open. Weighed in at 2lbs 5oz. wasn't as pictured. Would NOT buy again from this seller.;negative
Small size is a benefit but it does not have that much mint in it and also you are done with it withing minutes so you will nee to take at least 2 or 3  mints.;negative
The tea is very weak. Even if you steep the tea for 5 or more minutes in very hot water the tea still comes out weak in color and flavor.;negative
Colors are not vivid and will not photograph well if using on a cake. Also the sprinkles were not packaged well. Humidity entered the box and caused clumping. Do not recommend.;negative
wish they were bigger they were a little on the stale side i gave them away;negative
The mouth of the bottles is so large that it is difficult to drink from the bottle without spilling the contents on the front of my shirt. Will not order again in this size.;negative
The most disgusting salami I have ever tasted. Buying salami from Amazon is never a good idea. Youre better off going to the local grocery store.;negative
While the flavor on these golden berries was fine, they are so much harder and seem almost stale compared to the fresh, soft golden berries I've gotten from other brands. I will not purchase again.;negative
They didn't taste very good. I'm trying to get rid the other 15 cans;negative
I did not like this product  nor did my son.  They were mealy (texture) and had a sour taste and an aftertaste that I did not like.;negative
Didn't care for the taste and it didn't do a thing for me sleep-wise.  I think this is one of those products where it will vary greatly for each individual.;negative
Crushed bottles so you could not open excep over a sink;negative
Just okay. Seemed like old product but can't be sure. Won't order again.;negative
"This product is a half of pint, not a full pint.
Also, ordered multiple times and once I received them molded. Other times they were in perfect shape.
The tomato are very small and lack taste.";negative
Not as good as the starbucks discontinued version. I returned this after trying it several times in my hot morning coffee.;negative
All eggs were broken and damaged other items in bun.;negative
Sorry but this product is awful. Has an odd taste.  It's going back.;negative
There was more paper filling than produce!  Very disappointing for the price!!!;negative
Very small amount of jelly beans for $9. They're the size of those little kid raisin boxes. Way too overpriced. I'm pretty disappointed.;negative
I do not like this product. It is too strong and does not have a pumpkin spice flavor. I do not recommend this product.;negative
Did not like it, too coarse, takes more time to cook, and not creamy.;negative
Great candy, terrible quality. All the candies I got were really hard compared to a bag bought at walmart. So much so I actually had to warm them up a little before eating them.;negative
Sorry but this tea tastes like I am swallowing liquid fire. It is sooo strong even in my 24 ounce thermos. I think I need abt 40 ounces to cut this with.;negative
MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU, BUT REALLY DOESN'T HAVE MUCH TASTE.  I'M EATING THEM.  NOT SOMETHING I'LL EVER ORDER AGAIN.;negative
There is not much mushroom taste. Disappointed.;negative
Moldy, gross. I threw up after taking a bite. Stick to the local stores.;negative
Only about 1/3 of it's maximum shelf life remaining.;negative
"The product is fine and as expected.  Great oils.

The product description is wrong.  I only got 3 bottles total not the 9 promised.  There is no return for this item, so I cannot request a refund.";negative
too spicy for me but if you use it put it on when the food is hot and it melts;negative
Flat tasting and get soggy right away.;negative
"The tea was not good, had a golden brown color and taste was bitter. After trying one tea bag I figure maybe it was just that one bad tea bag so
tried another tea bag and still the same. will not recommend.";negative
Too many rotten, bitter seeds, won't be reordering.;negative
When I opened the box the mayo was separated into a big glob of white mushy looking stuff and greasy looking liquid....will NOT buy again....says can't return so I wasted my money...NOT HAPPY!!!;negative
Not our favorite. Bitter aftertaste;negative
Terrible. Horrible tasting. I can't drink it and enjoy. Purchase the supplement Garcinia Cambogia fruit extract and get the results this product claims to produce.;negative
Horrible taste-had to throw it out. Will not buy again.;negative
The product is good just overpriced;negative
the flavor in these cider cups is a bit off.  it tastes packaged....a bit chemical-y....only a hint of the actual apple cider taste. Wont order again.;negative
Have only tried two flavors and both seemed weak and tasted bitter to me.  I would not buy again.;negative
Actually I did not like the taste of the decaf. It is bitter.  I gave it away.;negative
Not a favorite and won't buy again.;negative
"WARNING! For ALL people on low sodium diets (like myself) this was shown as No Salt when I ""put it in my cart"" but when I received it they a SALTED to the teeth!!";negative
Because it is gelatinous and made with corn syrup. READ LABELS (and maybe reviews because if I had I would have abstained from buying this);negative
If you like freeze-dried food, go for it.  If you're not sure I will not suggest it.;negative
Not good at all. TOO expensive. Taste of all 3 brands is bad. Better to but those at the supermarket;negative
Tastes really old, I tried to return it, but I couldn't;negative
I was very disappointed with this coffee. It is very bitter tasting , and I put  creamer in ny coffee. So to me that's saying something if a coffee is bitter after you put creamer in it!;negative
Not the same cut of meat as in past orders.  Disappointed.;negative
Wow 8.99 for that itty bitty bag! I was disappointed by that small sample bag,shame on them!;negative
Some of the packs were open and they had Mentos just loose in there. I will not be ordering this again!;negative
Don't like the flavor, doesn't taste like a dark roast.;negative
I have not been able to make a single cup of coffee without grounds in it. Not pleased with this, don't like to chew my coffee.;negative
Smells great when brewing, however, is extremely bitter and has no candy cane taste at all.;negative
It was very stale I have bought it before and it was a lot better softer I put them out for clients and everyone complaining very hard and wish it was soft like the ones Ive gotten before;negative
Warning!!  Top of the bottle may break off when removing seal and opening. Cheap glass! I've had it happen to two bottles so far. Had to toss the whole thing.;negative
They have many flavors i enjoy, this is not one of them.;negative
too many broken.  regular are good, but these chocolate are chalky.  the ones that were not broken were cute.;negative
Product is delicious but can came dented.;negative
I didn't have good results bread was heavy and too sourdoughy;negative
It's okay, not great flavor.  Not sweet, but not deep chocolate flavor.;negative
Not a good quality of himalayan salt, some of them feels like stone.;negative
Buy beef tips. Much better taste, if you can stand the price difference. Heavy handed loaded with salt. Shame, because overall, good value;negative
LOVE that they are grass fed...just happen to taste awful...;negative
Yuck. So disappointed. Doesn't taste like any good coffee I've ever tasted. very nutty and bitter. Very off putting taste.;negative
Bloody awful milk, Don't buy! it's basically dishwater and is nothing like milk. Try any other options but this!;negative
Honestly did not enjoy them. Had like a plain taste to them. Very dry taste. Harder than most crackers. Not as much taste to them compared to regular saltines.;negative
At first I thought this was a great idea...then I tasted it and immediately regretted it.  Misses the pickle mark completely.;negative
Salt a lovely pink.  Grinds well.  Extremely over priced.;negative
The chickpeas were very stale and tasteless.;negative
My Brazilian wife says this is the worst coffee she ever tasted.  It doesn't come close to a Brazilian taste.  Nobody would drink it.  Gave it to the homeless and they threw it away!;negative
This product is not environmentally sensitive ... you will put it in the trash after one cup. Thus, thousands of years from now, your mistake will endure!!;negative
We got these for Hanukkah and they taste horrible!!  The kids were begging for the dairy free ones because they taste better.  Not worth the money on this item.;negative
not sure if it does what it says it will do. don't feel any different but keep using it to see. probably will not buy again;negative
No flavor associated with any type of Earl Grey Tea I have ever had before. Flat nothing flavor.;negative
The water is excellent but not the seller. Both cases were open and water was removed. I hope that they enjoyed stealing from a disabled person.;negative
This was horrid the crust was like cardboard the veggies were tasteless.;negative
For the price I paid for this small can it would take 3 1/2 cans to equal one box of hard tack that I can get for under $8.00, so not worth the money, will not order again.;negative
DELIVERED ITEM WAS NOT ENGLISH BREAKFAST.;negative
I was very annoyed when I read on the package that this is a product from CHINA!!!! This is mentioned nowhere on this page!;negative
Too many bitter (toxic) ones. I would strongly encourage one not to carelessly eat through this bag.;negative
Would to purchase again....doesn't taste anything like peanut butter to me;negative
"Great coffee, have been very pleased.  Package however came with the middle one having rips and tears.  Coffee leaking everywhere.

Someone should have caught this?";negative
"smell like butter scotch NOT butter and bottle was damaged I would NOT buy again, because I wanted ""Butter"" NOT butter SCOTCH flavor!!!!";negative
Beans are good, cans were all badly dented. I ordered these on another occasion with the same results. I won't buy  them again because I'm not sure how safe they are. Damage happened prior to shipping to me.;negative
I didn't care for this coffee at all, a bit bitter to my taste.;negative
Mediocre caramel corn .not terrible;negative
Taste was only marginal - they were okay but will not repurchase.;negative
These were terrible.  The taste was chemical and not like a pizza or really anything I want in my mouth.  Also... mostly crushed so ewwww on many levels.;negative
Great quantity but not the best flavor they taste nothing like the runts but thankfully my son will still eat them being we use them for behavior rewards;negative
I was expecting something like Trader Joe's fiberful green bars. I was sadly disappointed. Inedibly crunchy with a really foul banana aftertaste. I may just throw the other 9 out.;negative
For the price, the quality is underwhelming, for sure.  Several strawberries had bad spots that had to be cut away.  I'm disappointed, especially since I live in California.;negative
I'm a fan of hot sauces and this one is not good. No flavor, no heat.;negative
"I never imagined a brand name like Red Mill would sell anything with such a bad taste.
Baking flour should be taste free.";negative
Did not taste like esprosso or chocolate;negative
I ordered 4 cans bc of reviews. Thus crab is awful. It's tasteless, dry, you cannot use it to cook with it in cold dishes. Complete waste of money.;negative
Complete waste of money. Once opened the cake looks NOTHING like the picture. It's basically a raisen cake, nothing more.;negative
Not good.  Some of the figs are hard.  I am giving them to the food bank.  Maybe they can use them in cooking.;negative
"FYI: Listed as gluten free but if you turn it over it says ""processed in a factory that also processes wheat"". I had 2 small bites before I saw the label & was sick the next day. So Celiacs beware.";negative
"Listing clearly states this contains ""Onion Powder"" when it actually comes with dehydrated onion flakes.  A big difference for someone who is not a fan of onions.";negative
This turned out to be really bad... it certainly grow and becomes alrger when you cook it but it neither has a good taste nor a good look when cookced;negative
Does not have a good vanilla taste. You can taste an extreme amount of alcohol.;negative
I also feel a bit deceived by the spuds not having organic label.  Why can't you be honest about this.;negative
This is inferior to the (mostly disappointing) Torani SF white chocolate.;negative
great price and presentation, otherwise the taste was very disappointing.  i could not even give it away tio my patients!;negative
Tastes like spearmint. If you like that flavor you'll probably like this. If not you'll hate it. I ordered this by mistake instead of Mojito & regret it.;negative
These are absolutely Twinkies and Cupcakes but they are undersized. Won't waste my money again!;negative
The flavors are acceptable and I use some on vegetables but the do not stick to popcorn that I bought them for.  Maybe nothing will.;negative
"This DOES NOT taste anything like sugar!!!!
There is no after taste, but it does not replace sugar in liquids like iced tea or coffee.";negative
Not a good chocolate flavor..will not buy again to use in molds.;negative
I ordered these thinking they would be like Kellogg's fruit bars but they are not and I took one bite and that was enough. The rest went to my office for who ever wanted them.;negative
No longer a good deal.  And the quality has significantly diminished;negative
I have a sensistive nose, so for me to call this bland is saying something.  No complaints about the price to try it out, but I would not considert bying it again.;negative
It is not what I expected. Little icing and taste pepper that I don't like;negative
Did not dissolve I choked on it every cup.;negative
The texture was very soft/mushy, almost unedible. This time of year I expect much better flavor and texture.;negative
I used to like Udis alot. Now the bread still tastes good but it has lots of holes in it and not usable for me.;negative
CONTAINS A LOT OF PEANUTS, returned for refund;negative
This coffee was bought for my husband and he disliked the taste.  He did not want another cup of it, just not a good flavor at all.;negative
Don't care for these, very little flavor even if using more than suggested amount.;negative
Overpriced refined sugar with some honey, and it arrived damaged.;negative
Mostly NOT stevia...did not read the small print or it was false advertising...  Not happy with it at all.;negative
While I knew these wouldn't have any flavor, I couldn't get past the weird texture.;negative
They don't taste the same as they did back in the 70s.  I don't like them @ all.  I just gave them away.;negative
This made me violently ill at my stomach. Vomiting and diarrhea.;negative
taste was ok but value was lacking. I will not make another purchase of this item. It was worth trying,;negative
It is okay but you really need to add some crab because it is hard to find in the soup. Once you load it with extra crab the soup has good flavor;negative
WELL THE TRUTH IS THE TASTE IS NOT FOR ME BYE THE VEGGES TASTE BETTER GOOD LUCK I KNOW YOUNG KIDS WELL YOU KNOW YOUR OWN KID DOES HE OR SHE LIKE YUCKY THEN THEY WILL LOVE IT ????;negative
Very watery, not worth the cost. Store cost is 5.00 less than amazon;negative
The kernels do pop big, but there are a lot of husks in the finished popcorn.  I won't buy it again.;negative
A WASTE of money... no slap here ... Wal-Mart sells better coffee than this.... Sorry....;negative
"Seems that a lot of the flavor must be in the oil. Mixed with water leaves a bland frosting like paste. Prefer the chocolate
but...
 won't be buying this again.";negative
Tasted pretty good, but a terrible value for how much you get vs. the cost.;negative
After boiling this for 50 minutes,  I gave up and threw some sauce on it anyway. Tasted like healthy rubber bands.  Threw it away.;negative
Didn't like the flavor - quite artificial-buy the AUstralian product - cheaper and much better;negative
Tastes horrible, after taste is even worse!;negative
Unsatisfied with item poor quality packaging;negative
There is absolutely no good reason to add potato starch to my shredded cheese. I guess I'll have to start shredding it myself.;negative
This may be a very healthy drink but not if one can not drink it because the taste is simply awful.  At least for me, I was unable to get past the taste.  So it was a total waste of money for me.;negative
"I've had a few other brands that tasted MUCH better to me; if there's only fennel and sugar in it, I think some of the seeds were moldy or contaminated.";negative
A very poor product that was extremely overpriced.;negative
This was horrible. After cooking, it was not shelly at all. Most of my time was spent washing this product. Not worth buying guys.;negative
"Tea would be better without the ""natural flavor.""  Too floral.  I find that it is not my preferred tea.  I have enjoyed the Davidson non-blended teas.";negative
These nuts were overpriced and the quality was not good.  Many were discolored and tasted stale.  I would not buy them again.;negative
"No definition of flavor
ALL TASTE SAME";negative
Not worth the money. Weak flavor as used as advertised. Not a good value.;negative
Did not like these. May be a personal preference, but the combination was super odd and very undiserable. Couldn't even finish one. Gifted the rest to someone else.;negative
I know I cant do a return due to flavor, but if I could, I would. It tastes gross and chemical/artificial. I don't know if its the entire Healthy Request like or just this one. Progresso is better.;negative
HEAVY OILY TASTE...NOT CRISP AND LIGHT...WANTED TO LIKE THE PRODUCT AS BETTER THAN WHAT IS ON MARKET BUT I JUST DON'T.;negative
These were not very crunchy. They were chewy and seemed a bit stale. I won't be buying this brand again.;negative
These do not taste fresh. They really don't have much taste at all. They are definitely not crispy. They're chewy. I try from a different company next.;negative
terrible after  taste  will not  buy  again;negative
"1. Small peanuts.
2. Broken 50% broken pieces, 50% whole.
3. Cheddar flavor is very mild.
4. Not what I expected.";negative
I have been sadly disappointed at lunch time twice now when I opened the box to find the turkey slices missing from the boxes.;negative
I love teas, of all kinds.... and I hated this tea. It tastes like you're drinking strong potpourri, and it leaves an odd slick feeling in your mouth after drinking.;negative
Arrived over ripe for the second time;negative
"Not really the best tasting, in my opinion.  Not very ""caramela-y"".";negative
I expected this tea to be floral but it is just weird.;negative
I absolutely love Haribo candy, the peaches and the raspberries are my favorite.  I tend to be someone who will eat just about any kind of candy, but these are so gross and stale they are inedible.  Pity.;negative
Small broken pieces with a bad taste. Should have returned them.;negative
The water flushes so quickly through the K-cup that the resulting brew is weak. I will try it using less water.;negative
Bad pods.  Exploding in my keurig 2.0 machine.  Other brands are working fine.  Tried a few before giving up and asking for a refund;negative
"Have you looked at the calories - have a Snickers instead...at least you'll enjoy the calories

Given 2 stars because my kids love it...but are fooled Because they think it's healthy";negative
They tasted great. But price to what u get was not worth it at all.;negative
Taste great however I didn't k ow these were so flexible size bags. I feel dumb paying $11 for $3 worth of product;negative
Tasted like sawdust. Not nearly as good as several other Kind bars I have purchased. Also, watch the size/count. Thought it was a good deal but it was a smaller box. Won't be getting this variety again.;negative
I ordered sliced almonds and received slivered. I managed to make them work, but it was not what I wanted.;negative
Not impressed! Beans were so dry I couldn't split all of them.  I loke to make vanilla sugar. The beans that I have bought in the past were very plump and fragrant. I will not buy these again.;negative
Watered down in my opinion. Going to stick with the regular ones.;negative
I was not impressed with the flavor.;negative
Not a dark maple syrup. It doesn't have much maple flavor.;negative
"shows 4and a half cups:  will not set

You have to use two packs to get 4 and a half cups.  Will not buy again";negative
"Don't purchase here, go to a store, not Amazon, to purchase.
Not as fresh. Much more expensive online.";negative
Not as good as I thought it would be. Could have done without the aloe chunks. Felt like I was eating jellyfish.;negative
The item that I received had mold on it!!!;negative
"It's not real chocolate! The inside is tasty but, the out ""chocolate"" it's only flavored chocolate doesn't even melt when you eat it. It's literally like wax. Waste of money ... threw them away!";negative
How did this come with ants? I am not sure where the problem occurred and the ants weren't apparent until I opened the first package. It's going to be awhile before I give oatmeal a go again.;negative
We all try to get our childhood memories back but this just made me realize that we can't.  Not really very good.  The memory was better than the cookie.;negative
Not to my taste but I wanted to try it. Maybe I'll try it again someday.;negative
only good thing is zero calories. tastes disgusting;negative
"This is instant coffee, cheap coffee!

I should have known by the cheap price!";negative
Bitter powder, did not add vanilla flavor at all.;negative
Did not grow. None of the kits by Eves Garden will grow. Don't waste your money.;negative
The chocolate was over tempered and super dry/waxy;negative
Success rate of about 60% with my NEW 575 model. Nothing but a headache!;negative
"somewhat bitter tasting and ended up donating/giving away the rest of them.  didn't really help for the purpose I was using thme for; upset stomach";negative
Worst tasting coconut oil I have ever purchased. Tastes like plastic...completely inedible and disgusting.;negative
Surely depends on you preference but this is not mine. A bit too much, not sure what, that one does not find in ordinary mayonnaise.;negative
These taste great! But... they contain some ingredients that I don't prefer to eat. Others may not be so bothered. So check the ingredients and be sure you are okay consuming them.;negative
Been using whole bean coffee too long.;negative
Bleh. This soup tastes like a combination of plastic and cardboard.;negative
The tea is all right.  However, the canister is extremely hard to open.;negative
"Chips only. Aside from two beef jerkys my box contained only chips.

There were no crackers. There were no cookies.

Falsh advertising.";negative
I can of soup at this price how nuts was I to order it  ILB IN TX I PAID 6.36 FOR I CAN PLUS SHIPPING 4.90 TOTAL 11.26 FOR I CAN OF SOUP.  DO NOT BUY  THIS IS ROBBERY!!!!!;negative
The amaretto flavor tastes artificial. Maybe their Amoretti Premium Crema Amaretto would be better. Not sure I want to spend any more money to find out though.;negative
Too bitter - returned.  Maybe it was exposed to too much heat while in storage?;negative
Not a good buy plus has sugar listed as the second ingredient and high fructose corn syrup to boot.;negative
"This is just ok for me. Too many noodles for my taste.
Taste bland too me.";negative
I was not fond of the flavors of this coffee... I will use it though not to waste it.;negative
What a horrific ripoff. I tried  the ginger beer and immediately  knew i had been robbed $15.;negative
This had dairy and did not care for it.;negative
Too hot for my tastes  - Combinations sounded so yummy and if you like HOT then go for it but for me, I couldn't taste any of the flavor because of the spiciness.;negative
"These tasted ""too fishy"" for me. I did not enjoy them. Has a nice spicy flavor but overpowering fish taste. I enjoy other Seasnax flavors.";negative
These kept falling apart easily...too much of a mess for our kids.  I won't purchase these again.  Plus, they didn't taste as good as we had hoped.;negative
Very Prompt Delivery, Quality Product.  Thank You.;negative
Had a lot of salt in the shipping box and very large grind. I also had some strange particles in the pkg.;negative
It was sooooo bitter tasting to me I could only take 2 sips. The Vanilla flavor could not be distinguished. This coffee is no way a medium roast. I feel bad I couldn't return it, so be forewarned.;negative
"Well. I always buy to drink Vietnamese ice coffee. This is too light. Lighter than regular ice coffee. Coffee powder sank. Is it because the powder is too small?
And also it took so long to delivery .";negative
"How can you sell a food product that has a warning label the reads, ""Contains chemicals known to California to cause birth defects, reproductive harm. That's not food, that's chemical warfare.";negative
Does not taste like the name suggests! Too sweet...more like Grenadine than cherry juice.  I am very disappointed and do NOT rec. Beautiful bottle.;negative
"again, the product needed to be  packed in dry ice...disappointed, can' buy chocolate from you,unless its winter !!!! i was going to join ""Prime"" but those experiences made me change my mind!!!";negative
Saw & tasted NO difference in the amount of caffeine for energy which Robusto is suppose to have more than Arabica!;negative
After 2 chews the gum lost all flavor.  It wasn't bad tasting but I chew gum for flavor not just to chew gum base.;negative
They have a strange chemical taste when u first pop them in your mouth.;negative
Doesn't taste the same as runts. I suggest getting them from bananarama or whatever it's called.;negative
Used two of these cups and threw the rest away. The cups burst and the grounds made a hellof a mess in my coffee maker. Coffee was unfit to drink....never again with these people;negative
These are tasteless to me.  I'd never buy them again.;negative
I used to love this tea, however the latest batch has no taste at all.  It tastes like overpriced regular black tea with not much vanilla flavor.;negative
Not a great taste..holds color well, thick and spreads well, too;negative
Super grainy and plastic-like taste. I've had way better mochi for less than half the price.;negative
"These have very little flavor and the texture is unappealing, very dry and ""heavy."" It's unfortunate, because I like the idea behind them, but I think a new recipe is in order.";negative
If you don't eat these up right away they get VERY sticky in the wrapper and are difficult to unwrap!;negative
Disgusting, bitter tasting candy. It had the texture of plastic and bitter medicinal herbs. Very off-putting and I am a licorice person.;negative
Disgusting! I cant believe the reviews on here, this taste like powdered Poop. it was seriously so gross :(;negative
Does not taste like regular gochujang. Also discolored (white foam) quickly, and did not last as long as the gochujang that comes in the tub.;negative
I think this is very Yucky and will not be ordering anymore tea pods like these.;negative
I was surprised with the musty stale smell when I opened the bag. Unfortunately the walnuts tasted a bit musty also. Will probably throw the bag away.;negative
Bland and lacking the richness of several other brands. Lightly salted, perhaps a bit more salt would cover up the dull flavor here. Glad I only bought one jar, back to regular brand.;negative
I couldn't even eat it and threw it away.  It didn't mix well, the texture was wrong and it tasted like chemicals.  I like Earth Balance, just not this product.;negative
I read all the reviews and I am really disappointed I wasted my money on this. The taste is horribly sweet and just not at all what I expected.;negative
"Way too dry and spicy. Instead of enjoying the meat flavor I basically had to ""enjoy"" the pepper. Won't buy it again.";negative
Thank you. price is to high for no more than you get.;negative
Yuck! Did not notice I was buying sugar free. Very bitter aftertaste because of the artificial sweetener. Would not recommend.;negative
didn't like them..faint taste of cinnamon and an odd fruity after taste...;negative
I am not a fan of these at all I would rather drink coffee Black than with these.;negative
To small for the price, don't waste your money. Taste not bad;negative
Too coarse, I don't have a grinder, so I gave this to a friend who could use it.;negative
Leaves a bitter aftertaste that I'm not fond of.;negative
I usually love Emerils but this box sat in someone's warehouse way too long. It tasted like dirty water.;negative
This is  a bold coffee, just as advertised.  It is way acidic for me.  I like bold coffee and have not had problems in the past.  I will pass the rest on to good friends.;negative
I won't buy this item ever ever again! 12 Small packages not worth the $16  I paid for , too expensive!;negative
I don't care for the taste. I could drink a gallon of oolong from our local Chinese restaurant, but I can't stomach one cup of this stuff.;negative
Packaging too small for the price. Won't buy again.;negative
Those were Very bitter tasting cacao nibs.. I still have them and don't know what to do with them.. they aren't even edible to me;negative
"overpriced and tons of sugar
gooey.";negative
It taste okay, but they are  not soft and the taste doesn't stay very long. I wouldn't buy them again.;negative
Arrived frozen. Had to request a refund;negative
Did not arrive ripe. Beware, the guacamole will have to wait - give them a couple of days to ripen.;negative
"The product page had the following confusing statement: ""New - CLEARANCE PRICE!!! PRODUCTS EXPIRE JULY 06, 2016"" The product expires within one month.";negative
soggy and tastes off. not recommended.;negative
I just returned this due to the fact that they all contain white grape juice. The photo of the ingredients list don't state that specifically. Unfortunately, I am allergic to grapes so I had to return it;negative
If you think this healthy.. Well you wrong.. Loaded with sugar;negative
These are terrible.  When you open the package, they smell rank.  They all taste the same, which is disappointing as well.;negative
ughh....wondering if I got a bad batch.  This stuff does not taste good.  It is a dark, army type green.  I picked it based on reviews, so I am thinking maybe just not a good batch??;negative
Bought them since I prefer packaged in small packets instead of one giant box.  They seemed suspiciously cheap still gave it a shot. Received them yesterday. They are VERY stale.;negative
Bought for a freind,he did not care for the flavor. The jerky itself was edible,just the flavor not to his liking;negative
Sand on every bite.  Don't buy it !!!!!!!!!!!!;negative
I have opened 2 of the 4 I purchased and they are a funky dark grey color. I have been buying these on regular basis for the past 1-2 years and this is the first batch I have been unhappy with.;negative
Can is way too big. Hard to get opened, way too much.;negative
i ordered cinnamon/raisin bread and received plain raisin bread..had not been looking for more I would not have discovered the error.  Now I'm mad;negative
"did NOTHING to make me sleepy. matter of fact, tried it couple more nights. Sleep was worse than taking nothing, very aggitated after drinking this,
and had to get up many times to pee.";negative
Got this do to reviewers saying it cleans out the dishwasher... nope. Do not believe it! Maybe OK for drinking (didn't try it...), but to clean your dishwasher? No way!;negative
I didn't care for this at all, it's a runny dough so you can't have a crust up the sides of it, only on the bottom. I also did't care for the flavor.;negative
Not what I was looking for.  They seem too dry and stringy for me.;negative
One of these was moldy. The ones that were not moldy weren't ripe. Won't be ordering again.;negative
I did not like this product at all.  It has a really odd flavor and the texture just doesn't do it for me!  Maybe it needs a different sauce to make it taste better!  I put a Thai Peanut sauce with it!;negative
I normally drink DO Matcha, I was trying to save money and bought this Matcha based on the reviews. I like Matcha straight and I could not drink this.;negative
Didn't taste good.  Off for some reason. Plus outrageously expensive.  I used to like Bush. Won't buy Bush again because with this price cant take the chance.;negative
Like a lot of other brands, these have the smell down, but not the taste.;negative
I couldn't dry brush this onto fondant. I couldn't dry brush it onto molding chocolate. I couldn't get it to dissolve into alcohol. This stuff is useless. It clumps and never blends properly.;negative
Product came stuffed  in mailbox!! Cookies all broken. Not very happy;negative
This is what I imagine mouse pee tastes like. I usually get better oolong in bad Chinese restaurants.;negative
WAY too oily ... even pouring oil off the top didn't help it.;negative
Prefer U.S. Organic dates from either Martha's Garden or Healthy Naked Dates in Arizona.  These dates are Product of Tunisia.;negative
Not the best. They taste kind of nasty to be honest.  I would have rather gone with a brown rice pasta.;negative
Too salty and sour, not my taste...;negative
The almonds taste old or off. They also had a powdery look to them.  I still use them but they don't taste good at all in my desserts. Perhaps I got a bad batch but they're the worst almonds I've ever tasted.;negative
Tastes burnt. That's about the only taste it has. Lacks all of the characteristics that define good coffee.;negative
Not at all what I expected, it was a gift so I don't know how good it tasted but it looked weird, I was disappointed when I saw it, the food looks fake.;negative
Tube is too short leaves almost 2 inches in the bottom of the bottle. Plastic is thin  and cheap.;negative
not cooked enough for me so we baked them off then very good;negative
Like plastic on the outside and cardboard in the middle.;negative
I do not like the taste and will not use it.  I am going to give the box to a friend who uses this in his tea;negative
I'm not thrilled with the flavor of this product.  It tastes like a root beer gone flat.  It's slightly better hot than iced but I doubt I'll finish even one bottle.;negative
Bitter taste,also had weird floating stuff in 5 of the bottles;negative
Overpriced for the few items that come in the box.  I won't purchase this again.;negative
Just okay. It didn't taste as good as the Tzatziki I bought prepackaged.;negative
It's not something I'd ever choose to eat again.  I like chick peas, but find these lackluster.  The texture is unappetizing.;negative
Huge bag however mine are all hard and taste awful minutes after. Disappointed. My dollar store gumball a taste better  and long longer.;negative
made from GMO soy. Eat it if you want hormonal deficits;negative
Nasty. Worse hummus of my life. Came dry, some opened and the chips all smashed. Naturally it is a NO REFUND item. Yay!;negative
Most of the juice cans were severely dented.  I don't buy dented can products.  Very disappointed.  Ordered this product from a different retailer and website and cans and juice were perfect!;negative
"It tastes quite awful. No where even close to real peanut butter!
I threw the jar after a trial of one spoon!";negative
I does not work in my keurig 2.0  at least the mad money one does not work;negative
I give only one star because the plastic bag, on the bottom of the box, had many small holes, which made the cereal stale and there was an added bonus of a bug inside the box.;negative
This gum has a hard texture and a very strong mint flavor that I do not find to taste like wintergreen in the slightest. Will not order again. Could hardly chew the first piece.;negative
very stale  I don't know why i have to write more to get this in, it is stupid and makes many now want to even write;negative
I like the concept of a sampler, and don't mind the small sized bites, but every variety in the package was stale. Surprisingly cardboard-like taste. Not something I'd recommend or purchase again.;negative
Very small as far as pineapples go. taste was good but just not big enough to warrant all that work!;negative
The peanuts I got was not fresh at all. There are just too many bad ones in the bag and it is hard to hand pick them out.;negative
Pretty looking lollypop for a candy bar, but tasted awful.  Not a hit with the junior high kids at all.;negative
really gross and it didn't give me any benefits;negative
They looked old! They also did not taste very fresh. I was so disappointed. Some were discolored. I will not order again.;negative
"I liked the seasoning but I've had better ""gourmet"" peanuts before. The other brands have better nuts! Virginia Diner and Royal Oak especially.";negative
Disintegrated in my mouth in less than 5 min. No buzz. Taste like you chewed up coffe beans.;negative
Tastes terrible, so bad I couldn't even get my roommates to drink this stuff when I told the house it was a free for all.  Nobody had a noticeable increase in energy or anything.  Just a gross gimmick.;negative
Maybe I got a bad batch, but I thought I had a bitter licorice taste.  Not what I would have thought I as Caribbean.;negative
I like that they got here fast but I guess I read the label wrong. I wanted just the regular jalepeno kind but it was cheddar jalepeno (they are not good at all).;negative
This brand of Oolong is much, much too wimpy.  Kind of like drinking hot water...  I won't buy it again.;negative
Never buying this brand again. Item arrived opened and with foreign material inside the box. It looked enough like mouse poop for me to refund the order and suspend my Fresh account. Gross.;negative
The only ones I liked were the sugar cinnamon cookies.  Wish you could buy them separately.;negative
Not very good. Very strong vinegar taste. Can't really taste anything else.;negative
I did not like it.  My 8 and 11 year old did not like it frozen into popsicles.  My 13 year old (Type One Diabetes) actually hated the taste.;negative
It contains sucralose.  And in my opinion, sucralose is evil.;negative
This Ghee is very grainy in appearance (see photo) and is not very flavorful.;negative
its for my husband who believes these things really won't spoil.. so it is an experiment for him...lol he  is having fun;negative
Dont eat this if you have Crohn's or Celiac disease. This isn't a good yeast, and will flare symptoms;negative
Was ok the crust was like cardboard. Won't buy again sorry Amy.;negative
I don't like the orange or grape flavor;negative
I can't believe I have 6 of these huge bottles to drink and it tastes nasty. Very strange aftertaste. I can't even describe it. I may see if the local food bank will take it. It's that bad.;negative
Not as good as I had hoped. The sweetness was fine, but it had a gritty feel to it. It also had dairy in it, which I am allergic to.;negative
This is just absolutely awful. The only thing worse is the flaked biltong.;negative
came stale had to throw them out they where not cheap either;negative
Wasn't sure at first if they maybe weren't fresh.;negative
Won't order again.  What happened to Jerky I remember as a kid.  This stuff tastes like it's made from a meat like product, not real meat.  Too sweet.;negative
It was ok. The slimming one gave me a stomachache. I may try it again someday to try the detox one.;negative
Haribo black licorice is terrible.  I love Haribo but their licorice is just awful.  If you like really really mild black licorice then you might enjoy these.;negative
Normally love kind bars.  These were crumbly and tasted very old.  Or maybe mishandled in the warehouse.  Not good at all.;negative
This is crap my bag was tore open I wouldn't eat it now for anything one star bad shipping;negative
Like the strawberry more and I felt the chocolate taset wasn't there.;negative
really did not care for it, ok I guess;negative
Applegate tends to be a little slimy.;negative
Tastes like cardboard but they are dehydrated potatoes after all.  They don't mix the best but the fact that they are all natural is good.  I have only tried them once though as the taste is just not good.;negative
The cookies tasted fine, but they didn't have the appeal of the picture. The center cookie had a large dot and the rest only had sprinkles. Considering the price, I wouldn't buy them again.;negative
disappointing/ You can't taste the cranberry which was the whole reason I bought these. The taste of cinnamon (I think) is so overwhelming it smothers the other flavors.;negative
Hugely over-priced.  Sam's sells this product for 66% less.  Save some money and get them there.;negative
Kirkland is a 1000 times better.  Very, very tiny.;negative
"Same as with other reviews for the McVities Biscuits.  This was the better tasting, BUT again
came broken in pieces!

Would not order again!";negative
Disappointed with the quality . . . not very aromatic.;negative
Terrible tasting.  Not up to par for a Hershey product.;negative
Way over priced. Poorly packed for shipping and arrived dented, so could not give as a gift as intended. Just your typical Hersey's kisses, so definitely not worth the high price being asked.;negative
Don't buy these expecting delicious cookies.  They're sweet and they're crisp and that's about it.  In their defense, gluten free is hard to do well.;negative
Don't like the taste--just don't find it satisfying.;negative
This had a week left before expiration, but it smelled really bad. It arrived cold, but it makes me think the meat wasn't always kept cold.;negative
Didn't care for these. No fkavor or aste at all. Not worth having bought it.;negative
"Ordered 01.05.2016.
Received 10/2016 date. Ok I guess";negative
"Nothing good about this. Seriously, nothing! It's weak, not fresh, and certainly overpriced for what you get.
French roast should be anything but weak. This doesn't have that bite, the caffeine, nothing.";negative
Too many cans arrived dented. There's not enough fat in the product, and it's the lauric acid in the fat that I'm after. I don't like the taste.;negative
I guess if you are a fan of flavored water which I am apparently not, these are an easy way to provide some flavor other than tasteless water.;negative
"Did not read ingredients and this ""vanilla"" has more cr*p in it than regular McCormick's vanilla! Artificial flavor and other junk. Boo :(";negative
It just doesn't taste good. The vegetables are too mushy and hardly any pasta. It caused major digestive problems. Never again;negative
"Terrible
Love Jello cooked chocolate pudding & Jello cheese cake mixes so thought this was worth buying a 6 pack.  Horrible after taste.  Would be embarrassed to give it away .... total loss!";negative
Normally we love L & L brownies. These have a gross flavor. We ate them but we won't reorder this particular flavor;negative
Has a cinnamon taste. I like cinnamon but do not like the taste of this. Neither does my daughter. A waste for us unfortunately.;negative
Not as good as their small round Cheddar Cheese Puffs.;negative
Not a lot of flavor.  Relatively plain taste - doesn't remind me of DD coffee.  Mild flavor, not too strong.;negative
taste a little off, i just did not care for them.  old man mike bengyak;negative
These muffins were dry and lacked a rich chocolate flavor.;negative
I don't think Aspen's Eggnog Mix tastes anything like eggnog.  It just made the milk very sweet.  Very disappointed.;negative
Maybe it's an acquired taste. But I won't be buying these again.;negative
Tastes like coconut, and also a synthetical flavor. Would not recommend these.;negative
Smells and tastes weak..not like a good strong cocoa.  Hershey's is better.;negative
Very tasteless.........I'm so disappointed.;negative
"I had a project in mind when I ordered the air plants when I recived them they would not work as I had thought they would
The returne process was easy, Great compant Hinterland Trading";negative
Changing my review after seeing honey in their ingredients when on the front the item has a vegan label. NOW they have redesigned their packaging.;negative
Too hard, tastes stale.  Not impressed.;negative
Even though it is supposed to be Caffeine-free, it has too much Caffeine, for my system.;negative
This is gross. I dumped the whole bottle after taking one sip of it.;negative
These don't taste like they have ANY salt on them.  They are chewy not crunchy.  Not at all what I was looking for.;negative
These were stale.  Such a disappointment.  I could barely chew them.  Don't buy them unless you are not worried about having to see a dentist!;negative
I was hoping for something I didn't receive. This flavor almost tasted like burnt vanilla with a strange aftertaste.;negative
Not as good as the ones bought at Costco.;negative
"save your money and skip this purchase.  No flavor.  I like a lot of Annie Chun's noodles, but this is definitely a ""no"".";negative
BEWARE!  COUNTRY OF ORIGIN IS CHINA;negative
This has become way too expensive. The price is ridiculous.;negative
Great cereal, but don't be misled by this seller's ad. This price is for one box--not 6 boxes.  Not sure why they haven't fixed this, as it's been advertised like this for months.;negative
"I will not be ordering these again.  Have come across many, many cashews which are black and some are even a fluorescent
green color.  Yuck.";negative
"Peculiar and salty little crunchy ""snacks."" Sort of good but not good enough to buy again. Cheetos are a better choice and cheaper too.";negative
It's sort of fine, but it's mostly bland trashwater.;negative
This is not a gluten free product. It contains flour. I didn't really taste it. One star for wrong advertising.;negative
Not a very good sauce.  Not much thicker than water and the taste was not what I consider a good tasting BBQ sauce.  I would not recommend this sauce nor will I purchase it again.;negative
Theyre delicious. But tiny. I was expecting something a little bit different. Bigger pieces. Not as authentic as I thought it would be. I thought traditionally some of them have nuts.;negative
2 stars as 50% of the cans in the package were badly damaged.  Which is a shame as the lentils taste really good.;negative
Not very good. Threw away. The chocolate tasted very bland.;negative
They are the driest awful tasting bars I've ever tried!;negative
This tea smells good, but my entire family doesn't like the flavor.  It just doesn't seem to work and tastes terrible.  What a shame, since I really like the idea of this tea.  Just had to throw the box out!;negative
When I get the product it is already broken and some powder of goji left in the box. The package turned out very sticky.;negative
I just didn't like any of the flavors.  Maybe it was me and not the soup.  I thought they all had the same taste.;negative
"most of the flakes were crumbled up into such small pieces - i mean, TINY - as half of the box was a fine powder !
come on Tony - what happened ?";negative
Don't like the texture will use to bake only.;negative
I don't like this product-I love lemon and don't think the lemon flavor is real tasting-I will not buy it again-the price is fine but otherwise I will not buy it any longer;negative
unfortunately, I took a gamble on this and ordered 3 packsit is way too salty and has very little Black Pepper Flavorthey should have called it Salt Flavored insteadyuck;negative
I like Sweetleaf packets much better in my coffee and  oatmeal!;negative
After drinking this for a while, I ended up throwing more than half of it away... I just did not like it...;negative
Tastes like salted nothingness. Many better ways to enjoy 100 calories. Also, yuck.;negative
Not much flavor at all.....sweetness is minimal;negative
These are absolutely disgusting. They are gritty and have a bitter aftertaste. I couldn't even finish the one I tried.;negative
Tastes like 50% bacon and 50% coconut. Why do I want coconut flavored bacon? I thought this would taste more like real bacon. I'll try the TVP bacon next.;negative
No taste, no color. I do not like because I need many grams for some flavor. I will not return to buy;negative
Has a gummy texture and not even close to regular pasta.  would  not buy again since there are better options available.;negative
does not work in my keurig, would never buy your product again;negative
Great licorice, but only if you can get it fresh. Avoid Terrific Deal Inc - their product was really old.;negative
Not very chewable. Did not taste that great.;negative
My kids been asking for one so I bought it and they didn't like it. So grape isn't a good flavor to choose from. I won't be buying this again.;negative
Weak don't recommend it for authentic moroccan flavor. Buy ahmed mint tea or numi tea. Stash is too peppermint flavory.;negative
Well after trying so many vegan drinks, this is only 2 stars.  It works fine if you adding fruit, banana.  But after a few bottles. The taste is  a tad terrible.  Overpriced as well.;negative
Another reviewer is right, the coffee is bitter. No amount of sugar can fix that. Going back to my tried and true for over a year now...Italian Lavaz**;negative
The only Jack Daniel's is the label taste like any other BQ sauce;negative
Way to sweet. The dark chocolate one is much better.;negative
I looooove mushroom but this broth is really really gross. Its more of a weird buttery/cream flavor (in the grossest way ever) than mushroom flavor. Totally ruined my recipe. Bleh.;negative
For someone who loves tea,  this one barely earns a passing grade.  The best part is the elegant tin can.  Twining's darjeeling is much better although by no means gourmet.;negative
Way too hot.  Bought it a while ago, and we never ate most of it.;negative
this smells bad and makes my smoothies taste worse. Ive had good bee pollen before.;negative
Soso. Prefer Challah bread unsliced;negative
Followed all proper instructions & plant died within a week!!;negative
I had high hopes for these peanut butters, but they are all just WAY too sweet. Hardly any peanut flavor. I'll be sticking with JIF or Skippy from now on...at least we can taste peanuts.;negative
Horrible taste, would not recommend;negative
Personally I found the texture disgusting;negative
I am so proud of these great companies to afford us options for conscious eating. I love other Beyond Meat items, but this one was just not my favorite. I just need to be honest.;negative
I love french vanilla tea, but this was absolutelt the worst taste, I usually drink 5-6 or more cups of hot tea a day, and this will not be one of them.;negative
Terribly sweet with the cherries and lacking in flavor overall. The squirrels like it so not a complete waste.;negative
I was very disappointed to hear that there has been some problems with Italian olive oils so I went back to California olive oils.;negative
This is just terrible ....the stevia sweetner in this product leaves a really bitter taste in your taste buds .....I do not recommend this to anyone!!!;negative
"Just not what I expected.
I'm not really sure what I thought it would taste like.
I love the Chai Teas, but this one ... Never again!";negative
Does not seem fresh, seeds's color is pale. Did not like the taste. Changing to a different brand.;negative
Was a pain to finish, very cheap quality coffee;negative
Did not help stomach made stomach worst;negative
This tuna is dry and hard.  I won't buy it again.;negative
The cherry one is way better then the other. These are okay but I think they should rethink their recipe. It could be better.;negative
Not very roasted, ... taste like raw peanuts;negative
Sorry but had a horrible taste and was hard.  Really wanted to enjoy it.;negative
They use low grade thin plastic bag without foil layer for oxygen and humidity protection and a horribly fragile zip lock that breaks after a few uses.;negative
Vendor great, product... not for me.  Tasted like a strong Lipton to me.... meh.  Back to my Lady Grey.;negative
"I found the gum to be so offensive that I threw it all out in my garbage.  Didn't even try to
return it.

Sorry - I was hoping for a much better experience.";negative
Not impressed. Taste like jack links original beef sticks.;negative
$9.99 for one can of soup  is this real?  terrible ad  deceiving  do not buy this item;negative
The pineapple taste is really bad according to my tastebuds;negative
No thanks.  Kind of bitter and has slight overtone of cardboard.  Organic Bold and Donut Shop are still our faves.;negative
Very weird taste, Not Torani's best flavor.;negative
Too pricey for what it is, but it was a cute surprise delivery for my Dad.;negative
It is extremely sticky. Won't ever buy this again.;negative
The chips were all broken in small pieces....I would not order them again.;negative
Received product promptly. The product leaves a very strong and nasty aftertaste.;negative
Had to use more than I wanted to in order to make the color darker on fondant.;negative
"Delivery was on time.
I usually like Starbuck's coffee but this was bitter and I was very disappointed.
I ordered another braqnd and it was not bitter.";negative
The concept of this product is exceptional.  However the coffee is very weak even at 6 oz. cup. Will not order again.;negative
EVRY CAN I GOT WAS DENTED SO BADLY.. NOT HAPPY CUZ THESE TOMATOES AINT CHEAP AND I YTHINK SOMEONE SHOULD FIX THIS FOR ME... OTHER THAN THAT I LOVE THESE TOMATOES ITS THE ONLY KIND I USE IN MY SAUCE;negative
absolutely did not like the flavor.;negative
This is much too sweet for my preference.;negative
this was my first try at clarified butter and i was not happy with it at all, i tried another brand on here called purity farms its in a blue can and i much prefer the flavor and its organic;negative
not sure if it's the brand, or because it was in plastic, or if something was wrong with my batch, or if it was rancid, but mine was THE worst coconut oil I've ever tried.;negative
Got a few bags of these for gifts. Doesn't taste ANYTHING like beer. Just a sweet jellybean.;negative
just not my style ... i'm sure others will like it;negative
Tastes like 7up but smells like oranges. Probably great as a cocktail mixer.;negative
The candy arrived squished, smashed up, and turning white. Never again.;negative
Like another reviewer said they are as hard as a rock so no telling if they are old or stored wrong but since the entire bag went into the garbage I will not be getting them again.;negative
Pretty disappointed.  Huge bottle but so bland, you have to use a ton.  And I am not that picky.  This is generic that just doesn't match up to Kernel Seasonings, or make your own blend;negative
Very bland.  I ordered to just eat plain.  I am sure they would be fine for and probably made for sushi.;negative
Very peppery. Tough and too spicy for my tastebuds.;negative
Gave me and my wife instant diarrhea.;negative
has sugar alcohol A LOT can't even taste lo han. Save your money and buy the real thing;negative
the candy stuck the wrapper and could not get the wrapper off the candy;negative
Not what I remembered!  Price is out of line.;negative
These are okay. I thought they were a bit crumbly, not sure why. I think I will stick to grocery store bars.;negative
I have been trying to get out of buy & save or whatever you call it, and it will not let me cancel it, so I have to return it every month.  Please cancel it for me, I do not want any more at any time.;negative
it's not my taste. i would not buy again, sorry.;negative
VERY TERRIBLE--LIKE DRIED CUT GRASS.  I WANT MY MONEY BACK.  nOTHING AT ALL LIKE CINNAMON.;negative
"This batch of sardines was truly horrible.
No human or cat would eat them.";negative
Threads for the dispensing end of tube broke first time I tried to use it. Flavor mixes are great, the gun... Not so much;negative
Did not care for taste AT ALL. Gave away to someone who did like the taste.;negative
I don't know why this got good reviews. Tastes bland,  like cardboard. Life is too short for poor quality coffee.  Peets is much better.  Avoid Gold Cup, but I did like their Pecan flavored coffee.;negative
taste like regular pops with sugar in them. I did not like them.;negative
Disappointing that it ain't have real dill, just coated in pickle flavored seasoning.;negative
"It doesn't taste much like anything. Maybe slightly chalky.
The Pad Thai was good, but this I won't be going back to.";negative
I just wanted menus to suck on, these quickly devolved in my mouth.  I said all I wish to say, why should I write seven more words?;negative
Awful a small box of cookies for $7 overpriced.;negative
The flavors, imo, are nothing special. Not bad but not very good. The small amount in each bag makes this not an attractive deal at all.;negative
These are the worst Jelly Belly Flops that I have ever tried to eat. I threw most of them away.  I can't believe anyone would sell a product this bad.;negative
This does not taste like Irish Cream. We did not like it, has an odd flavor. We will not order this again.;negative
Bought cacao. Tastes disgusting. Not sure if I will be able to finish all the bottles. Waste of money. Not sure if I can return with one opened though.;negative
This was a little too bold for my taste, if you really like dark extra bold coffe, it may work for you, but in my opinion just a little harsh for my taste.;negative
I haven't tasted them yet, but I did recieve one soup with gluten. Ok it says gluten free here on the site. I can't eat gluten so now what?;negative
Sweetened product. Tastes fake and chemically. Much prefer the raw unsweetened varieties.;negative
"This coffee isn't that good especially if you select the mug size on you Keurig.
It tastes too weak for my palette.";negative
Flax flavored ocello sponge. Yeah, weird texture and flavor and I would just rather do without. However it is somewhat bread-like and if you can tolerate it God bless you!;negative
"The product is fine.  The listing is misleading.  At the very bottom of the description it says: ""varieties are sold separately"".";negative
"yuk mal appropos

85% raisins, rest cranberrys
some di some dat
some getthefucc";negative
"EXP DATE IS VERY SHORT. Love the product but allowing only a short period to consume one-star.
Replacments provides for an additional 7 days. Moo Moo";negative
Ordered before...Very GOOD. This batch was stale and crushed in box. Most cookies were broken;negative
I bought these as a healthy snack alternative for my kids and myself. I have to say I wasn't really a fan of anything other than the apples. Even my kids weren't impressed. I won't be buying these again.;negative
Again too much flavoring where I could not taste the almonds at all.  I was expecting more truffle and less kick!  Again gave it away.;negative
i popped one bowl of this popcorn and it was awful. it didn't pop well at all and the popcorn popped up so small. i through the rest of the bag in the trash. i would never order this again.;negative
Most slices were OK but some were bitter. I think there was citron in the cake. I don't like citrons. Add a star if you do.;negative
Broken open in box and box was broken on side;negative
This is incredibly salty -- less flavor than salt.;negative
To peppery. Not like the restaurant flavor.;negative
Week brew coffee - will not buy again.;negative
Flakes are too crushed. The Raisin Bran Crunch is much better. This is mush.;negative
Wasn't really the stuff I thought it was,  have to use a ton of it to taste sweet, and I don't like using that much chemicals.;negative
I wasn't impressed with these.  They arrived crumbled and their flavor was meh.  They were dry and tasted stale.  Maybe I received a bad batch.;negative
Have order these in the past and always good - this time not so much.  Somewhat stale and there were little blacks specks throughout the package;negative
Not a fan.  It is very gritty/grainy.  I use protein powder all the time so I will not buy this again.;negative
no go on these, just dry bland flavor, so im not dissapointed there weren't many;negative
i use to love these bars, but odawalla made changes to the bar and it is not as good. i will not buy again. it is more chewy, sweet...something is off about it. very disappointed in the new bars.;negative
Gross. Not much else to say .. even my other who eats anything couldn't stand them... all boxes went in the garbage.;negative
I was expecting a nice full coffee with some brighter tones to it being a Kenyan but it isn't anything like that.  Very sour foretaste that lingers into a very thin finish.;negative
I didn't like the flavor. Tasted like bitter lemon and no sweetness but if you like lemon water at restaurants def tastes like that;negative
This container must have been stored someplace HOT at one point. The wrappers were pretty much impossible to get off...;negative
Vinegar flavor is too strong for us. We didn't enjoy them. Fresh and crunchy. Liked bbq and regular sea salt flavors very much!;negative
Tastes like dirty stale water.  Not much more I can say.  The bottle looks nice.;negative
The ingredients listed in the description and the ingredient label photo are not the same as the received product;negative
"Bland and somewhat watery; not at all the flavorful tomato soup I remember from Campbell's.  Don't know what they did to change the formula but I won't buy it again.";negative
It is expensive considering amount of it. It could be good for one time trial if I have not been exposing to Tapioca. I would make it with tapioca powder.;negative
I wanted to like this but it doesn't have the tang like Miracle Whip that I was seeking.  I can finish this off as its not nasty but it lacks any bite and the texture is a tad oily/gummy for me.;negative
Like many, I only received one bag instead of the 10 in the ad.;negative
This product clogged up my machine.  I will never order again.;negative
Ghirardelli opened in the 1800s.  That must be when my package was created.  Broken, melted, WHITE!  Never again.;negative
Not for me too many ingredients that may not be book for you.;negative
These were stale.  My husband is not at all picky but couldn't eat them....had to toss!  I've gotten these before, but never will again!;negative
Quite possibly the worst jasmine tea I've ever had in my life. It tastes like you are drinking a straw bale.;negative
These figurines are so tiny that they aren't even worth buying. Kids would choke on them in a second!!;negative
I did not catch that they had a smokey flavor.  For me, it ruins the chips.  For that reason I would not purchase them again.;negative
We were not pleased with the taste of this item.;negative
Well was looking for something different in a hot cereal i like oatmeal but i do tire of it. This stuff just does not taste that great to me will not buy again !;negative
Does not work in newer machine. Not a smooth flavor and stays kind of chunky. Wouldn't buy again.;negative
Too sweet for me. Lingering after taste. Mine is called 'surfer'. I do not recommend this.;negative
Yuk, that is all I have to say.  We eat these all the time, make granola with them.  So much cheaper on Amazon and now I see why.  These taste NOTHING like Pepitas.  Just saying....;negative
YUCK...this stuff tastes terrible !!;negative
Save your money!  I cannot really define the taste.  A little banana taste, a crunch of coconut...bleh!  Was saving these for when I got the munchies.  Had to rinse my mouth out.;negative
PIECE  OF JUNK. IT WAS A NICE TRY BUT JUST DOES NOT WORK.;negative
Did not like it gave to friend  she likes;negative
I just found out (from some Amazon reviewers) that it is very unhealthy to give wild animals raw peanuts.  I am very upset.;negative
"It wound up costing me twice as much as just getting it from the grocery store.
Their packages are just pages of 1 pack of 18 instead of the (3)packs of 18 I normally purchase.
Probably my fault.";negative
I think they have a quality product but this is not my favorite flavor. Since trying this I only buy the Zesty Chili Lime.;negative
"It does not taste like Chinese Restaurant Tea.  Much more ""earthy""";negative
This is extremely sweet. Serving size is just a quarter teaspoon, enough to sweeten a cup of coffee, but at that size you don't get much chocolate flavor.  This is extremely sweet for any kind of chocolate.;negative
Nice flavor, however, the nuts are swimming in cotton seed oil.;negative
Does not taste like my old favorites growing up. The flavor is bland and it breaks into shards instead of pieces.;negative
the hostess products when fresh are very good but when they are 3 months that's 90 days out of code you might as well use them for hockey pucks because you are not going to eat them;negative
this tea was very sweet. too sweet for my taste. the cinnamon was ok but flavor too sweet for my taste.;negative
I found this in the black jelly bean section and thought I was getting licrich, It was blackberry;negative
It tastes terrible and give you gas. I don't like it at all. would not use again. Many other products out there that are much better.;negative
"I use Prince of Peace's White Tea and it is very good. This tastes terrible to me.

I am cheap but I threw it all away because the taste was so bad.";negative
Chocolate arrived melted and not usable.;negative
Thought I ordered cherries but got cranberry. They don't taste good;negative
the berry tastes much better than the orange;negative
Very salty tasting and just not palate pleasing.  I've bought other brands as quick recipe fixes and this was the worst of the lot.;negative
Product tastes good but amount provided too small.  Look elseware;negative
I think my bag is stale. It just doesnt pop. Only 1/4 of it will pop.;negative
Odd flavor combination...however the almond is awesome;negative
I like sugar, but this is a bit ridiculous. The fruit was too hard and really tasteless. I couldn't even finish the bag. Waste of money.;negative
almost all cashews, almost no pecans;negative
I was hopeful, but didn't feel a thing...no boost, energy kick, nothing.  Back to my five hour!;negative
"I was excited for anything with power and garlic in their product name, but this lacked flavor. It was only a few bucks, but found it to be a real waste.
It just takes up space in my fridge, blah.";negative
Simply put without going in to details, just did not like it. I will stay with Spectrum Coconut Oil Thanks;negative
Not what I was expecting. Lots of sugar coating, tastes like sugar not papaya. Would not buy again.;negative
It was stale and we could not eat it.;negative
Item was as described. Just wasn't sure how to use it or whay's its purpose. I used it in sauces and stews.;negative
Too thick.  Did not taste as good as others I have bought;negative
They are ok, but I wouldn't buy them again at this price.;negative
This was pretty gritty. The taste was ok.;negative
too much shell  does pop well  small kernels and a lot of shell;negative
Big disappointment. Taste like what you step in while tipping cows so the name is correct. Many better coffees on amazon for less.;negative
THE MIXTURE IS NOT EQUAL OF FLAVORS;negative
After laying awake for two nights, I was disappointed to discover there is a lot of caffeine in the product.  It is very frustrating that this active ingredient is not emblazoned on the label or the listing.;negative
This tea smells bad and it also tastes bad. You don't get much for the price and there are much better brands out there for less money;negative
I just got for may expiration how could I eat everything in one month;negative
Taste is good but why add milk powder???? Keep it vegan.;negative
Sorry but this tastes like plain tomato sauce, no spice at all.;negative
I bought this to make pancakes.  The texture was spongy and not at all appetizing.  I tossed the rest and will stick with the Atkins baking mix.;negative
I don't like the texture or the flavors.;negative
I liked the hot in the Arriba and thought I would try the medium - no dice - the hot is better.  This medium is way too mild with no bite.  Still a pretty good taste but not hot enough for us.;negative
Not much licorice, the taste of anis more prominant.;negative
Fairly weak coffee both in taste and strength. It was good enough to drink, but not good enough to purchase again.;negative
Disappointed - not spicy enough at all - bland flavor.  Not worth it.;negative
Don't care for taste. Funny after taste.;negative
For some reason I thought this was a popcorn product. It is ok but not fantastic... the taste is mediocre. Not much bang for the buck.;negative
Pretty flavorless. Your favorite brand of pre-sliced bread is more memorable.;negative
Grainy powder with twigs and bits of dirt.;negative
No bite, no heat, no real ginger flavor unless you chew 3 at a time, and I mean chew.;negative
I drink a lot of pickle juice for cramps, but in my opinion this brand tasted terrible. Maybe it was a bad bottle, but I will not try it again when there are brands out there that I really like.;negative
Yummy,  but it had many broken bits.;negative
Tried it a couple of times and just did not care for the taste at all. The tea bags are not wrapped individually and some of them were broken that tea fell out. Needless to say they went in the garbage.;negative
Strong aftertaste.  Not all that good.  Will use it up but won't buy it again.;negative
It came in with the chocolate part runny and the white part was rather hardened with suger crystals like it was old.;negative
caused inflammation in my body.  I am gluten intolerant and the inflammation from this product caused the same effect, even though it is gluten-free.;negative
Too much Pectin...Flavors are not strong enough.  Also this product was made in China.  If I knew that I would NOT have ordered it.  I will not reorder this product.;negative
PRODUCT UNUSABLE- 25% cand DENTED- POSSIBLE SAFETY PROBLEMS WITH BOTULISM;negative
This tea has a very weak peach flavor. I do not intend to order it again. Stash Premium Peach Black Tea has a more robust peach flavor.;negative
It was so green, it was not edible.;negative
Price: $13.74 ($0.79 / oz) indicates a count of 12 .... it is not;negative
Super sweet with no flavor.  Also not good texture, kind of chalky and pretty crumbly. :(;negative
Not as good as Turko Baba. Fail. :-(;negative
They were stale or something.  We threw them out.;negative
These keep getting stuck in my verismo, no idea why. I use other capsules from this brand with no problem. Not a huge fan of the taste either.;negative
OK for those who like a mild cup of coffee, but it's not like what you get at a McDonalds restaurant for breakfast.;negative
Not so good.  Weak flavor of chocolate.;negative
Good value, tastes great, but has soy added. BB-remove the soy.;negative
What is wrong with these? The sauce is nothing like other raviolis. Its kinda spicy. The ravioli is bland and hard. These are horrible.;negative
I was very disappointed in how many have artificial flavors. I will not be ordering again.;negative
Not at all like the good ones from the grocery store. Bitter, bitter, bitter.;negative
I received the regular corn nuts and I ordered the ranch not thrilled but I will eat them. Please don't do it again. Love the ranch ones;negative
I did not care for the flavor of Udi's cherry walnut granola. The taste seemed chemically to me. I have enjoyed the other Udi's products I have tried.;negative
I've purchased this product many times from other vendors. The recent bag I received from Amazon is too soft with no spicy flavor as in the past.;negative
I would never buy this again.  It taste like cow poop.  When growing up, we used to make it and it was delicious and I saw this and decided to buy it but, big mistake!!!;negative
This tasted bad to me.  I would not buy this product again.  Nothing bad against the seller as this product was delivered on time.;negative
good seller, fair price, fast delivery--could not manage to get past taste and teture to eat them;negative
They were definitely not a medium size... small to extra small;negative
Should have a sodium warning on the box.  I literally could not eat it and threw them in the trash.  Do not waste your money on this product.;negative
Where is the the pepermint flavor? all sugar!!!!!!!!!!! will not purchase again;negative
disappointed they stick in the box and cannot take the bag outl;negative
The nuts were rancid, not all but enough to spoil the whole pack! Shame on you!;negative
Bitter tasting and not worth the cost.;negative
Weak and flavorless. The spices are out of  balance.  Almost undrinkable.;negative
The coffee leaked from the pods and clogged my Keurig. I won't buy again;negative
I HATE IT, I TASTE, & I THREW ALL 12 BOTTLES OUT;negative
"i do not recommend this product to anyone who eats organic healthy food
an real disappointment and grocery items are not refundable";negative
Very artificial strong strawberry taste.;negative
Package arrived damaged and with two cans missing.;negative
This is three individual size bags.  This is NOT three typical large bags.  Pay close attention to the weight. 3 qty  1.75 oz bags.;negative
"Garbage that was leftover from Christmas
Notice the box.  Candies are just as old
Sad";negative
To me, this tastes just like Trader Joes decaf Irish Breakfast, which is much cheaper. Not buying again. Plus this is too astringent for me n makes my mouth pucker.;negative
Not impressed with any of Annie's products, all very bland!;negative
I ordered these because when I bought this popcorn at the grocery store it was fine, but these were kind of stale. Still eatable not not as good.;negative
Cheap but not worth buying.  It doesn't have that deep rich flavor and aroma of dark-roast K-cups brings out, and not sure why a lot of folks gave a high rating.;negative
A bit bummed out that this salmon contains a soy filler. Never dreamed it would. Thyroid problems + soy = bad combo.;negative
Not what I expected.  Very disappointed that I can't send back.;negative
This is very poor tea. I would not recommend it to anybody.;negative
Don't waste your money... The sugar free version is terrible... Very little flavoring... This product is not up to the Amoretti standards... I love their regular flavorings...;negative
"Unfortunately this particular box of gums contained staled and hard pieces.
Don't know why, since the fruity flavour Orbit gums were great . . . .";negative
Although I love the chicken bites also labeled with this flavor, these are overly salty and awful tasting. Threw mine away after 2 bites. Another family member hated them too.;negative
The batch I received tasted of vinegar so strongly my son nearly threw up. They are also far too salty.;negative
WAY too sweet for something claiming to be key lime flavored.  It's got lime- but just too much sugar to go with it.;negative
1 out of 2 looks like a stepping stone you can get from a hardware store. Very disappointing. Now what do I do?;negative
Flavor is gone very quickly with trident gum, buy extra instead!;negative
The yellow popcorn has a very stale taste.  The same brand's white popcorn is much more crisp and fresh.  I ended up popping the yellow corn and feeding it to my chickens.;negative
might be great for cooking but not for skin. it's a mess to try and put on and you have to clean up after you put on. plus it seems to be bad for face vs. coconut oil.;negative
was a little too sweet for my taste;negative
Truthfully I didn't like this at all - but that's just me.;negative
Bad, I put four bags all in one mug ,and still taste like a water and not like tea, very disappointment.;negative
We have used this brand for months and this is the first time we have been disappointed.  Seemed like refined coconut oil not Extra Virgin.;negative
I don't drink coffee but thought this would work with my Pero. I didn't care for the taste with the Pero. I ate trying to use it up in other things.;negative
We, so I thought, gave tried all GF bread crumbs until I came across this brand. Tried it and did NOT like it at all, my kids even asked what tastes different in the meatloaf...;negative
These cups will NOT work in the Keurig 2.0 brewers.;negative
Didn't like the flavor of these. Gave them all to a charity food drive;negative
All of these were too saucy and salty! I only like this company's beef and potatoes.;negative
I just didn't like the taste and texture.;negative
This tea was pretty tasteless compared to others I have purchased.;negative
Ohhhh talk about not what I expected AT ALL. Tastes like someone whipped up sweet n low.;negative
I did not care for these at all. The texture was intolerable. Threw away the entire shipment.;negative
This may be healthier than other substitutes, but it tastes nasty.;negative
Not pure monk fruit for the price find either erythrytol or stevia more affordable;negative
Flavors so/so... very thick so they don't spread well.  And when i opened the jar there was big space where peanut butter was missing... they shorted us.;negative
I used to like columbian coffee but I now favor costa rican coffee.;negative
Taste is subjective, but with all the RAVES about this flavor, figured we'd give it a try. Not as good as everyone claims. We prefer other flavors. Love KIND bars, just not this flavor.;negative
this came completely stale, it was like eating a circus peanuts in a cone. I won't be buying this brand again.;negative
This is very weak chai tea very little flavoring;negative
It's hard to find the broccoli in this chunky soup, since it's the size of parsley flakes. It's best used as a dip or similar. There are better Progresso soups.;negative
so using a flavored coffee is a little much for me. My son LOVES it though. So for that reason, I buy it.;negative
insanely small amount for the $$$$$;negative
"Very disappointing if you have been eating Bumble Bee or another good brand.
I'm using them for cat food.";negative
I was disappointed with a chemical taste and smell.  I believe this was a quality control issue and these are undrinkable.  Truly worse than old coffee from a fast food restaurant.;negative
The slices are smaller, not really filling.;negative
These were more like candy than lozenges, and much stronger honey flavor. I could hardly taste any ginger.;negative
Nothing against the snacks.  I just can't take the taste of seaweed--salty and fishy.;negative
I had been ordering cinnamon from another source & I decided to try this because it was less expensive per pound.  It tasted weak, not very sweet & a bit stale.  I returned it.;negative
Taste is very strong even in small doses for my tastes. Leaves a very strong aftertaste and I like fairly salty popcorn. A little goes a very long way so be careful.;negative
Not one can in this 12-can shrink-wrapped order was undented. Most of the dents were deep. Some cans had multiple dents. No thanks.;negative
I had too much trouble finding good directions and getting the information I needed to use these kefir grains.;negative
I just did not like the strong taste.. Maybe good for others just not me..;negative
Don't be fooled!  Yes, this has a fair amount of protein, however the amount of sugar in the product negates the benefit of the protein.  Tastes fine, but the product name is highly misleading.;negative
no coffee taste, will not purchase again.;negative
Molded ridiculously fast. Disgusting.;negative
Really excited about these, but they were really strange tasting. Tossed the cooked one and donated the rest.  Wish I had been able to try without ordering a whole box.;negative
Not for me. But just a taste thing. Fast shipping and great price.... IF you like them.  :);negative
This game is really hard to chew. It looks like they may have updated it to a different type of gum called juicy fruit fruity chews. I recommend buying those instead.;negative
Not really that impressed. Very dry and the spices seem 'off'. My favorite snack of this sort is still Bhuja Crunchy seasoned Peas (also purchased on Amazon);negative
Didn't notice any difference after using it for a month.  No energy boost, no metabolism change, etc.  Not bad though, tastes just like match tea.;negative
Wonderful but there are better options;negative
Yucky Taste. I'll stick with Plantation.;negative
Gross, unhelpful, not as described.  Suggestion from doctor but this product not the same.;negative
was trying to make something like a lobster roll with this, pretty bad should have just gotten some shrimp and made it that way Will not buy again;negative
overpriced, did not know since I could not shop for a few weeks at the stores;negative
I should have trusted those reviews that said it tasted like chemicals. They were being kind. One bite was all I could stand. Sad because the red and black as so good!;negative
as others noted it seems old - dry and little flavor;negative
Used to love these. Taste was weird maybe old.;negative
These do not taste good.  Even from beer drinkers.  Was kind of a joke gift, but didn't expect them to be disgusting.;negative
"This is for 1 box of altoids on 12!!!!!!!!!! Horrible deal!!!!
Returning mine, I can get these on sale at Walgreens for .99 cents a box!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!";negative
Not my favorite soda stream flavor.;negative
Not much flavor, even after adding chocolate chips :( My kids wouldnt eat them.;negative
Low quality. Had several people try it and nobody liked the coffee this produced.;negative
NOT AS ADVERTISED!  There were only 3 colors, red, green, and white, PLAIN sprinkles, no mix.  False advertising and picture.;negative
Not real tasty. Check for sugar content. Not like regular or low sodium V8;negative
Not as good as original Im honestly glad Im done with the box. But whats weird I remember these being so good but that wasn't the case when I got them.;negative
Only two survived and they have still not bloomed. I love the two I have. I would be nice if more had survived and if they would bloom.;negative
Free pricing for noodles even if they are made of Buckwheat;negative
some were melted in their package and others were swollen, had to discard almost 30%;negative
For the price of 80oz this is a GREAT deal... however, it tastes awful. In my opinion it is not worth the good deal. I'd rather pay a little more for better tasting fondant.;negative
Very few RED pieces and the Yellow were stale (Hard);negative
Not happy. The ingredients list includes (among other questionable ingredients): Bht (To Maintain Freshness), Yellow 6 Lake, Yellow 5 Lake, Yellow 5, Red 40, Yellow 6 And Blue 1.;negative
I am not a fan.  I bought because I am doing the Whole 30 and these are compliant.  It separates once in the coffee.  It tastes oily, not creamy.  Unfortunately, I will be throwing these away.  Blech!;negative
Something seems to have gone wrong in the formulation of this product. Other Katz GF foods are fabulous and I will keep buying  them. However, this one tasted so bad that I threw it away.;negative
a lot of the nuts were bad won't order again;negative
For cappuccino it was not rich, sweet or creamy enough.  Was very disappointed in all of them.;negative
I suggest choosing another brand of candied orange peel. This brand is sweet but with a very mild almost unidentifiable orange flavor.;negative
Way overpriced and not worth a s*** here...Most of the product had mold in two days...Disgusting.;negative
Has really strong smoke flavor that I don't care for.;negative
Was not impressed at all. This didn't have a very strong flavor. I had to use 4x as much in my shake to get an adequate flavor strength.;negative
Didn't really like the taste. Didn't taste like caramel to me.;negative
I think I was expecting a sweet snack....and this wasn't it :(.  While the taste and texture is ok...its almost savory.  Not what I expected at all.;negative
An unrecognizable, unpalatable cookie - and an insult - to original Danish Wedding. A cardboard-confection, using really old cardboard, and no sugar to even coat it.;negative
Didn't taste like hazelnut OR chocolate.  Not worth the money OR calories.;negative
"Very disappointing flavor.
Ended up returning it to amazon.
Stick with real milk chocolate.";negative
"PI CANCELLED THIS COCO, IT SEEMS IT HAS LESS OF REAL COCO AND MORE FLAVONDS/
I WANTED MORE FLAVOR FROM NATURE AND NOT CHEMICAL.

RESPECTFULLY
mickeytialy3@aol.com";negative
Takes like alcohol, which normally wouldn't be the worst thing, but not for breakfast on a Tuesday...;negative
Every bar was broken in multiple pieces.;negative
stale if amazon gonna get into food better work on this;negative
This tasted only of alcohol with a hint of vanilla.  I added two vanilla beans so as not to have to throw it out.;negative
I tried to sprout these and after two days a lot of the soy beans did not germinate and began to rot.  I tried picking them out but there were so many I was disgusted and had to return it.;negative
tried two recipes hoping for a healthier way of cooking but could not get past the taste of coconut in my food. I ended up giving it to my neighbor;negative
Not giant but extra small and a lot of tiny pieces. Not worth the price!;negative
this coffee has a very funny taste to it not good you would think wolfgang it would be good don't buy this coffee this is a review of 6 people there are 6 people in my shop we all hate it not good;negative
Really awful. Tasteless with a weird texture. Ordered the lemon peel as well and it's equally as bad. Ruined my Christmas cookies.;negative
It's ok. Not as good as Garrett's popcorn.;negative
"The cookies are great and I have no problem with them
When the tins were delivered the box looked perfect but 2 of the 3 tins were dented
Also to my surprise Costco has them for about half the price.";negative
I did not like this brand of pumking spice had a slight bitter taste. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED AND STUCK WITH A FULL BOX  I can't use.;negative
For the price these sucked.  I went to local grocer, bought a bag of Snyder's Pretzels , scraped off the salt and was happy again.;negative
Not great, disappointed at the weak flavor, not typical for the Hawaiian robust flavor I am used to.  Will not purchase again.;negative
It's just sooo small. The taste is good but not that fantastic.;negative
I got medium roast, and it tastes more like a super light blend. Could really barely taste the coffee.;negative
"I just didn't find them that good.  Most of them got discarded.

Flavor not exceptional, not a great thing to be chewing on.

Disappointing.";negative
Gone up $7 since my last two pirchases at beginning and end of December!!  Not happy;negative
I made a mistake by buying two bags.husband cannot take this it affects his stomach bad.might b okay for someone else;negative
This is not the same as I used to buy.  What happened to it?;negative
has aftertaste... if left unrefrigertated  lots of mold....;negative
Thought this was going to be a special treat - better than Swiss Miss Hot Choc. Save your money and buy reg. packs of Hot Choc. at any grocery store :);negative
I got these to add to my son's lunches.  He said they tasted okay.  However, half the box were crumbs.;negative
I add one star because I haven't receive the mash potatoes yet but in the past I loved them & still do;negative
The taste is mild but there is a ton of salt in each cube. The salt overpowers the chicken taste.;negative
If it was suppose to have carmel flavoring, I could not tell because it was too milky. I like a taste to my hot drinks.;negative
Packages are filthy and the contents are crushed.;negative
mine were rotten. only one was OK. They were pretty beat up. Although in plastic protector. . .;negative
I was looking to replace the discontinued McCormick Cajun seasoning.  But this one is not near as good.  I think it's hotter and not as tasty.;negative
Flavor is off--calling it strawberry takes imagination.  Also, the licorice is extremely hard--maybe stale--and very difficult to chew.  We gave up and discarded most of the package.;negative
I like that it's organic and BPA free, but the decaf has no flavor really.  It's very weak.  I brewed it on the very strongest Keurig setting and added no cream, and could taste it a little bit better.;negative
"Tastes horrible. Like flavorless sodastream.
Do not try it grizz";negative
Tastes great but does separate and is a pain to mix.;negative
AWFUUUULL !!!  This isn't coffee...it's like dishwater with a hint of something!!!  YUCK!!!  Waste of money!!;negative
bland flavorless should have ordered the porchini instead;negative
not to crazy about this halva.don,t think I will buy again;negative
Thought it was like belacan but not. More fishy.;negative
I have bought other chocolate Stevia drops but this one has a little bit of a bitter taste Will not send back but will not order this flavor again;negative
Yuck!  Pringles are not like they used to be.  Just yuck.  Will not buy again.;negative
Bottom of bottles rounded by over filling.  Will not stand up. Leaks when opened.  Cannot use;negative
"Title says 50 count tea bags and this is loose leaf tea.
I'm not sure how it tastes as I have yet to go buy disposable bags.";negative
A little too sweet.....I think it had some sugar substitute in this.  I gave it away to a friend who likes sweeter things.;negative
"stale. product is the original but the gummy bears are cloudy. normally gummies  are clear these are cloudy and the flavor is not exactly the same.
they all kinda taste the same.";negative
Not the best dressing I was looking for skinny girl and mistakenly bought this instead, asks from the fact that it was super expensive for 3 bottles. I only used 1 the other 2 are sitting there.;negative
ORDERED THIS FOR MY FRIENDS WHO DRINK DECAF. NOT ME;negative
Arrived stale and soft. Enough said. Threw them out.;negative
It wasn't terrible but it's not as strong as I would like.;negative
No disclaimer what so ever, I can't believe anyone would give this to their kids...;negative
I really tried to like these, I know they are good for you. But, I just couldn't.  They are not delicious.;negative
I liked nothing. They are gross tasting. I want a refund. This is not a returnable item. I am so mad.;negative
Not as tasty as hearty chicken cup o Noodles.;negative
I didn't care much for the flavors in this package;negative
These made me sh*t myself inside out!;negative
Neither my daughter or me like the flavors;negative
Not good and too salty with too big of chunks of salt;negative
These walnuts are so old I know they were picked last year. Very low quality. In order to eat them, I have had to cook with them, as they taste rancid.;negative
Do not buy in warmer weather. Both bags came as a melted mass of goo.;negative
"I tried several different ways to make this. I never got a hint of ""cherry or chocolate"" flavor. Even the coffee flavor itself was not very good.";negative
Not nearly as good as their oreo-style cookies;negative
All four flavors taste very foul. I'd imagine this is how deluted house cleaners taste like. This product also gives the water a chemical smell, which makes the product fishy. DO NOT BUY!;negative
Thought this is was going to have the butterfly's w a lunch out whole at least to help me remove them for sheet nope nothin gotta cut them and as you cut they rip;negative
This is a powder base, very salty, and it doesn't taste much like beef.;negative
This gum is okay.  Purchased it to replace the Trident Candy Cane gum that seems to have disappeared off the face of the earth and have been underwhelmed.  Definitely not as good as the Trident version.;negative
Order jars of mayo at your own peril. They are thrown in a box with no cushion and sent your way. If it hadn't exploded I would have been worried that the seal was broken in transit.;negative
These arrived melted into a gooey blob.;negative
These do not taste well. Then get hard and dryer out super fast and overall not very good. The difference is calories and carbs to the no tamales isn't different enough to warranty these at all;negative
I don't like the taste of coconut water...;negative
The taste of these pretzels is good However, the amount of salt is overwhelming. I purchased an entire box, which turned out to be a pretty big mistake. We will not be able to finish these.;negative
Nearly half the batch was out of date and moldy inside. Disgusting. I hope my daughter doesn't get sick from eating some of it. Waste of money.;negative
It's sweet but you can barely taste the pumpkin flavor. I would rather have Chai.  Really disappointing because all the other Cafe Escapes are AMAZING.;negative
Yuck!  This tastes like it has gone bad.  Waste of money-- can't return it.  Ick.;negative
The candy was not fresh and had a brittleness to it that is not typical of fresh.;negative
"WTF is caffeine doing in a supposedly ""healthy"" soda alternative.  Waste of money and just threw this in the recycling as I can't have caffeine.";negative
I love Bai juice and I love carbonated water but this flavor is not good.  I'm not sure I'll even drink more than the one I tasted...;negative
Doesn't taste like bacon.  I was hoping it would be more of a shock factor.;negative
Love this coffee and have been sending to my daughter as well.  No bitter after taste.  Love it!!!;negative
These taste terrible.....I won't be buying these again.;negative
My bread machine makes wonderful bread from other mix brands but consistently fails with this mix.;negative
Not what I had hoped for in a cherry cola at all. Some people seem to really like it, but not me. The sweetener tastes very odd. No perceptible cola flavor and only sort of recognizable cherry.;negative
the seal on these k cups broke, grinds, coffee everywhere, probably a defective batch, will update after contacting company.;negative
I don't think these are very good cookies. Not worth the money at all.;negative
Tastes good, but too much caffine and gave me indigestion.;negative
Very Disappointed . . . Name is misleading as this is not Kona Coffee . . . what the BIG Print implies, the small print explains: Blend = 90% Arabica + only 10% Kona !  *Let the buyer beware!*;negative
Tastes like old beer. Very bad. Other flavors are good tho;negative
The Kisses Where to Old to eat, they were turning white. White on dark chocolate. So I gave them away, What a waste of money.....;negative
Missing straw. No returns ? Uh why?;negative
It was very difficult to enjoy any of the candies in this bag because they were all melted during shipment.;negative
Safety seal broken, had to discard since there are no returns.;negative
There is little Jasmine taste in this tea.  The tea tastes like some sort of herbal medicine tea.;negative
this is a very strong and bitter coffee, sorry I purchased it....will go back to my Illy coffee.;negative
They all tasted the same. We never got a nasty one!!;negative
Too hard to chew, very hard consistency.  Poor flavor...;negative
Awful. I use Lavazza in my Moka pot and love it but Lavazza Kcups made the worst cup of coffee I ever had.;negative
Only one kind worked in our machine. What a joke.;negative
This is my favorite favorite KIND bar flavor, but sadly this entire box was stale and inedible (even though the expiration day does read May 2018). Very unfortunate. Hopefully won't happen again.;negative
Flavor is just ok. Suggest you use an organic healthy italian sausage instead. Pretty dry in comparison to the good stuff.;negative
Stale Twinkie, lousy bacon that you can barely taste. Not the best quality chocolate either. No redeeming value.  A lot of money, don't bother.;negative
Tastes horrible!!! Had a very overpowering sunflower taste.;negative
That's the best thing I can say about this formula.  Clumpy, does not dissolve and tastes pretty well nasty.  I'm trying to find people I can give the cans away to without feeling mean.;negative
Don't buy this. It's all water with no taste. Save your money.;negative
"I always buy Crown prince  sardines and they used to be delicous , i bought  a case of  12
but this batch was terrible tasteless and i am throwing it";negative
Better than nothing, but a little odd tasting.;negative
i brought this to cook with and it has no coconut taste. Wont buy this again.;negative
These went from 2 oz to 1/2 oz  from tasting good to nasty with an after taste that just won't go away.  I'm cancelling my S&S today.;negative
Never going to know for sure how good this product is. When I opened the package, flour was everywhere. Box was crushed and mangled beyond any usefulness.;negative
Something about this flavor makes me throw up every time I try to eat it. The roast beef flavor is the best;negative
"If I am not mistaken , I think it said mild chili, and this is not mild.  It has jalapeno peppers in it and we're not used to such hot chili. The flavor is very good though and is nice and thick.
Dorothy";negative
Holy Cow is this SWEEEEET !!  Geeze,,,,way too sweet for me....if I wanted candy I would order candy.!  Won't order again.;negative
Awful.  Very dry.  I ordered a lot of this--shame on me-- and threw out most of it.  A total waste of money.;negative
None of the other flavors last in my house except these, no one seems to like them.;negative
"This is NOT ""Just like sugar"".
 Has a very faint sweet and bitter taste. Does not mix well with liquids.
Don't waste your money.";negative
My mistake. Thought I ordered kippered snacks. Don't care much for sardines.;negative
Horrible!!!! What happened to the original recipe of the peanut butter carnation bars.  I will not order this again.  Carnation, go back to your original recipe.;negative
I know a lot of people like these mucho.  For me they are too sweet, hurts my teeth.;negative
This is a blend.  I thought I was buying 100% Hawaiian.;negative
My stomach had issues with this organic black bean pasta.;negative
I love the girl scout cookies that these are supposed to taste like but I didn't care for these granola bars at all. My daughter liked them or else I would have only given them one star.;negative
Too much salt. Like drinking sea water. Yikes.;negative
Dry, flaky and bland.  Will not buy again,;negative
They aren't really air plants I don't think...you have to take them out and water them once a week...making it quite a pain in the butt to take care of them.;negative
Did not care for their version of mint;negative
These are a scam! They have no salt, were stales, and every one was burnt. They are probably buying the burned ones from the factory and passing them off on Amazon. Don't get fooled!;negative
Seriously, this ginger tea has no bite to it at all.  I cannot believe it but I think I may return it.  Disappointed.;negative
Way too expensive. Go to the grocery store for a better deal.;negative
Not a good product at all.  There is not enough Sriracha in it and it did not properly emulsify so it is not pleasant at all;negative
They came smashed some of the bags of chips were burst inside the larger container. Not please with this one!;negative
Nice energy boost but wish it was cheaper for such a small bottle.;negative
The rainbow Twizzlers flavor is weak. Nothing like the great Strawberry flavor of the normal Twizzlers. I would not reorder these as it is hard to tell one flavor from another.;negative
Great crackers, but arrived in crumbs, even the box was smashed.;negative
I was disappointed in these. They were very spicy and they gave me bathroom troubles. Will not buy again!;negative
I love that it's made in USA but it came in large clumps that were impossible to sift, crush or use.;negative
Yuck. My husband tried and tried to get these things to work, but they were gross. We tried following the directions and also doing other things to make them work. No go!;negative
All the favors taste very similar and not very good! Only liked about 3 different flavor a and there were only one or two of them! All the not so good favors had 3 or more of each;negative
I wanted to love it, but it is really salty! and its annoying that you can't close the box once you open it.;negative
It is ok, the product I received was old and clumpy.;negative
I am sorry Vega SaviSeed, but these Karmalized seeds taste awful to me. I think they would taste better without the caramelizing outside layer with a little bit of sea salt only.;negative
Bought this thinking  it was going to be very rich, very chocolatey cocoa. It's not.;negative
Just recieved these and almost broke a tooth before realizing they are well past their best by date of December 2017. Wish we could have tried fresh bars.;negative
...all the way around. Way too coursely ground, too costly for the amount...much preferred Simply Organic Ground Nutmeg. It was better quality, and very reasonably priced.  Much more product for the money.;negative
Very gooey and sticky. Flavor not bad, but not worth it.;negative
I only wish I could send it back.  It is terrible!  It has no flavor and I cannot imagine a use for it.;negative
Too sweet, tried it on some dishes but not really a fan. It is similar to soy sauce but it's very sweet tasting.;negative
This was terrible.  It's never going to be eaten.  Wasted money.;negative
Not for me...but I should have read the ingredients more closely. Oh well, someone around here likes them. They took the whole freak'n box!!;negative
seems like there is not enough of a jolt for me I will not be repurchasing;negative
Not EVEN CLOSE  to the quality of the full size glass dropper bottles of Sweet Drops. These little ones are too hard to dispense, and don't taste as good for some reason.;negative
GEE I CLICKED ON SUGAR FREE AND ORDERED BECAUSE IT WAS SUGAR FREE SCREWED AGAIN WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN TOO;negative
Chocolate biscuits were all stuck together and could not break them apart without breaking them into little bits.  Very good tasting but I like a full biscuit.;negative
Not really impressed.  I thought it would have a garlic flavor that would blow you away.  It does not.  It is also a little salty for no reason.;negative
The genmaicha tea from Numi is not flavorful because they use a few little bits of toasted brown rice instead of whole kernels, so that flavor is absent.;negative
These did not fit in my Keurig at all, and a lot were damaged when I put them in the Keurig. I would not recommend or buy again.;negative
"when using the k-cups they would crack open when brewing, not good, all the tea would go into the
cup and couldn't drink it.";negative
Small pieces.  Seems expensive for not much gum.;negative
Doesn't tast like cream cheese. Its bitter. Not sure what the heck this stuff is suppose to flavor!;negative
I purchased these cranberries expecting something different, but the reviews were pretty accurate, not great for snacking. They may ok for baking.;negative
I ordered this candy for my husband who is diabetic.  When we ate it we were expecting the crunch of a Chick O Stick.  Unfortunately they were soft and soggy.  Not a very good flavor.;negative
this gets no stars.  It says it fits Kurig but does NOT.  I will get a refund.;negative
Vegetarians beware! this product contains eggs....  Had to give it away since the ingredients listed eggs but the main description didn't.;negative
Super salty. Didnt taste very fresh. Aldi brand is much better.;negative
Wanted to like it. Not exactly what I was expecting. It wasn't bad. I'm just used to a very strong blue flavor.;negative
This is the weakest tea I ever tasted. I actually put 3 bags in a diffuser and still could not taste it. A waste of money;negative
Difficult to fill in the air. even more difficult to flatten it.;negative
For a cake mix it's not the best. Too gooey and pricey.;negative
Love the concept but I could barely swallow half of one of these things. So dense, tastes like a ball of protein powder, and just overall nearly gag-inducing.;negative
Tasted very bland, with fairly poor texture. Either I prepared it incorrectly, or it just tasted like water. Also wasn't spicy at all.;negative
Nice texture for the first 15 seconds.  The gum does not have a strong ginger flavor.  The flavor itself is mild and fades within 30 seconds, rights when the texture gets too slimy/sticky.  Won't repurchase.;negative
Was disappointed not what I expected.;negative
The bags burn in the microwave. Holes burst out with butter and kernals all over the oven. What a mess. Other brands do much better.;negative
Had to request a refund, candy was stale or improperly stored;negative
Haven't opened the package yet because once I read the ingredients I was thoroughly disappointed -- dextrose, sucralose, fructose, etc. Why not just cane sugar, which would be more in line w/the price!;negative
This is 180 degrees off from the good asafetida sold at Indian grocery.  A pinch is all you need . I'm not sure what this is but not the real deal like the cooks use in India.;negative
I guess people like this stuff, but for me it leaves a bitter aftertaste.  I threw it out.;negative
I would not buy again, mainly because half the shelf life is gone because it was packaged over 15 months ago.  I probably will send this back for fresher product.;negative
Very disappointing- as low a cup size as I set on my Keurig pot it still tastes like French Roast, not Espresso.;negative
Just gross. Can't stand to eat them.;negative
I don't know why, but I much preferred the salt coins to this candy. Both are Gustaf's salt or double salt licorice, but the coins tasted better and the texture was more enjoyable to me.;negative
Tiny beans, hardly any flavor.  I made coffee twice thinking I hadn't added enough beans.  Both batches were terrible.  Taste is subjective.;negative
I was spoiled growing up near so many apple orchards and cider mills. i prefer the real stuff. this just didn't even compare.;negative
Looks like dishwater and has no taste.;negative
Not as coconut tasting as another brand.  Liquidized.;negative
Glad I tried these, but I wasn't too impressed with the way these turned out when I made them in the microwave or in the oven.;negative
"Mine wasn't solid/spreadable.
Came as a thick liquid, lid leaked also and made a mess inside package.

Smells/tastes good. Won't buy again";negative
strong after taste, ruins a good cup of coffee.  even when used in baked goods you can taste it.  guess the good thing is it will not cause a spike in blood sugar but you won't enjoy the food you are eating.;negative
This took a long time to ship and also was rough on my throat (tried pancakes and then crepes).  I will look elsewhere for a finer product.;negative
Excellent brand which I have been using for years. Unfortunately 3/6 boxes were shipped open, lids and foil cover off and we lost the contents (exterior box was intact);negative
My daughter doesn't like coconut water. I was hoping these would taste like fruit juice but she says they taste like coconut water. I love them though so I will drink them.;negative
Dissapointed, I ordered strawberry ,but received  peach.;negative
Way to small, do not know what to do with them or how to use them;negative
Different  have to acquire  a  taste for  it;negative
Tea brew system is OK, the tea that came with it (which i've had there tea before and its normally amazing) just wasn't for me. I didn't like it at all.;negative
This is not a sweet flavored drink so be prepared for that.  I really didn't like it;negative
Where's the salt? Dry and boring, now I'm stuck with three bags!;negative
I bought all three flavors for various kids and adults and no one liked the chocolate.  Very disappointing.;negative
Was looking forward to this and ended up being disappointed.  Saw them on shark tank and got excited.  It wasn't smooth and just had a eh taste.;negative
Got for coffee, not happy. Tastes chemically.;negative
Free hell I ordered the item to make this free with Sub. and Save not known it did not count.;negative
I never write a bad review but this product is far away from the original line;negative
I did not care for this cherry juice. It tasted different from the other tart cherry juices I tried. Its flavor was different and its real thick.;negative
The bananas came bruised and within a day were mushy. We had to throw all of them out and didn't eat them, which is a waste.;negative
Slimey, sticky and tasted terrible .... Threw out the entire case!;negative
It's just too salty and hot not very much flavor, I was rather disappointed as I am a big fan of the pain is good line.;negative
Disgusting.  One bite and the rest went into the trash.;negative
The shipment on Dec. 28th 2015 was very stale and tastes awful. I am very disappointed with the flavor of that shipment so much that I cancelled my subscription;negative
Don't really like this tea since it always makes me hungry and leaves a not very nice taste in my mouth.;negative
"stale hard candies non edible must have been stored for months
bag had hole in it to let in air";negative
"The bag of seeds had worms in it!
I didn't even have to open the bag to see the worms crawling...";negative
Tastes really good but does not do anything to help sleep, at least for me. Not worth the price.;negative
Ordered the wrong one ........ meant to get Veranda blend instead. My mistake.;negative
Dry, hard and rather stale tasting ... not good.;negative
No good. Too salty. Too fishy. All eggs are squished to the point of turning into a liquid. Way overpriced for what it is.;negative
Spoke with vega some ingredients from China in their products. Yum yum.;negative
Turns to slime and tastes like dead fish.  Giving it away.  Thought this was going to be similar to kale chips.;negative
"Small amount and over priced.  Unusual flavor.  (The ""5-star ratings and reviews look fishy to me.)  I do not recommend these macaroons and I won't buy them again.  Lesson learned.";negative
I love the cereal, but it got crushed in the big box it was delivered in.;negative
This has an odd chemical undertone and a nasty after taste.  Maybe it was a bad batch but the other sodastream flavors had that same peculiar taste.  Not a fan of this brand of syrup.;negative
I really like the honeydew flavor, but watermelon just wasn't that good. No complaints about the quality, just not a very good watermelon flavor, it was too artificial tasting, like a cheap candy.;negative
These were just ok. They are not exactly like the ones found in the cereal. These seemed a bit stale and firm compared to the ones in the cereal;negative
Taste is fine, but very week sweetness, need to use a lot!;negative
Decaf was the WEAKEST coffee we've ever had.;negative
Not one of my favorites, no reason, just not as good as other Columbian blends.;negative
Nasty creamer! My friend told me it was better for me. So we tried had bitter taste. Not ordering again!;negative
"Unfortunately the ones we got are horrible quality. Not fresh, and also taste like they were absorbing humidity for a while, not crunchy all the way either. Should return ;/";negative
Subscribe and save brought these to my door at a great price however I couldn't get anyone to ear them! Ended up giving them to my neighbor girl.;negative
Bad bitter taste. Get Jim's Sweet Love flavor. It's much better.;negative
what a joke i had to spend extra money to set up the plants come on change the picture and tell them you got to set it up yourself what a joke.;negative
Tastes fine. Just don't pay the online price. Go get it at your local super market for 1/10th the price.;negative
not honey, just sugar with flavoring;negative
The cardboard box would have tasted better. Being healthy is one thing, eating this is just wrong.;negative
These nuts are drenched in oil... the only way to eat them is to rub them with a paper towel first... then they are edible. I would not buy again.;negative
This was a very light roast and was not to my liking.  It tasted very light and bland.  I will not be buying this again.;negative
This may be perfectly fine tea for brewing, but I was expecting it to be the bright green powder I use in my smoothie. This is leaves for brewing only.;negative
Of poor quality  Made a taffy like mess with butter .This almost cost a big bowl of cheadar popcorn to b tossed but ate it anyway .Then dicarded this horrible product.;negative
We didn't like these.  IOO, they tasted a bit waxy which made them unpleasant.;negative
Fiber one streusel bars...shipped to someone else!;negative
Missing that fatty strip, sizes super inconsistent;negative
It's convenient, but I'll stick to Uncle Ben's microwave rice.  This rice had a weird after-taste and needed seasoning, whereas I am usually perfectly happy with plain rice.  Won't buy this again.;negative
"Had high hopes after seeing this product on ""Wrapped"".  As a lover of chocolate and molasses, how can you go wrong, right?  Mmmm, just ok in my opinion.  My mom and dad loved them so maybe its just me.";negative
just not the gum for me, nice packaging just too different;negative
Steaz other teas are better than this one.;negative
"nothing germinated.......  Kept trying and even with much care and planting in peat pots nothing came up.
Nothing came up.";negative
"Awful taste.  If I could have given it a ""no stars"" I would have.  tried three of them.  Threw the rest away.  Wouldn't even bring them to work.";negative
I only ate one of these and tossed them.  They were terribly chalky.  The flavor was okay, but the texture was just meh.;negative
Nearly undrinkable flavor. Anyone who says these are delicious is lying. Also, if you don't shake the can well, you get a nice oozy mess of brown sludge at the bottom.;negative
I always buy these and the company unfortunately changed the texture which was a huge part of what I liked. Please change back the texture!;negative
I only got one in the pack it is clearly states 2 and I would like the other one I bought! please and thank you!;negative
these were old and didn't look nice for the valentines we were using them for. We made olaf valentines with marshmallows and all that. Amazon took care of it though and refunded our money.;negative
"I bought this as a replacement for coffee because it is acceptable to drink even with acid reflux
But the taste, ugh, its bad, I threw it away";negative
I like the sauce but the seal was broken for one of the containers and the sauce leaked in the whole package :(;negative
Sent to a friend as a gift and she said they tasted stale-will not be re-ordering.;negative
Love the product, not the flavor.  I love ginger ale. I have tasted other ginger candy.  Just personal preference, but this was not the flavor for me.;negative
The lager plants did not survive, and do not look at all well after their initial arrival- I really like them too- its the one that looks like a big gift bow.;negative
My tap water tastes better than this.  Has a dirty aftertaste.  I bought this based on reviews.  I find it hard to believe people really like this water.;negative
Not a real dark roast.  Lacking in flavor.;negative
WEIRD TASTE, PROBABLY MY BATCH...WHO KNOWS ? W-S HAS A GREAT ONE, LOOK FOR IT !!!;negative
Full of sugar, like an injection of sugar in your blood.;negative
This is a cheap tea imported to the western market with a big markup.  It is very strong and almost approaches a low quality black tea.;negative
Too sweet. No butter.  Bland overall.  Will never buy this ever again.  I am stuck with a box of popcorn that no likes.;negative
Nuts are rancid - I have eaten twice and twice I have gotten sick!!!  BEWARE!!  I should have known when almost all of the pistachios were brown instead of green that something wasn't right.;negative
They tasted stale and just a little off, not like I was used to.;negative
Tastes pretty terrible, almost like a pumpkin spice candle, it has that strong taste that's too overpowering.;negative
did not seem very fresh? had an OLD smell to bag? I will NOT buy this brand again! For the HIGH price I expected FRESH! not OLD leftover product?;negative
Was excited 2find organic chips! HOWEVER, they arrived 65% smashed into crumbs,  not as whole chips for dipping! Very Disappointed!;negative
OMG these are the worst pretzels I have ever ate in my life!;negative
Butter chicken or butter paneer is always very mild in the southern indian restaurants so when i saw 1 pepper, i thought mild.  This is definately a 2-3 pepper recipe. :(;negative
Not much flavor - the stuff in the tube is much better.;negative
Made with palm oil :( Poor animals. Raise up your soul and pass this buy.;negative
I was trying to find another tea similar to Maharaja Chai Oolong. Perhaps this was an unfair comparison.;negative
"OH how disappointing!  Pies were overly sweet, with very little real coconut.  Will not purchase again.

Dr. B. Morrison";negative
They just don't taste that well to me.;negative
I didn't enjoy the taste, but perhaps I can still use it for an egg replacer in recipes?;negative
Stale and rancid nuts! Maybe it's related to plastic bag packaging.;negative
Not a lot of cinnamon flavor. Not a great selection, not horrible.;negative
The WORST dried mulberries I have ever had. Dried out and crispy with tiny twigs still attached. Too much of a hassle to return.;negative
"3 jars of crystallized mess.

It does say Naturally Crystallized on the jar so I guess it's my fault for not enlarging the image to read it.";negative
FREIGHT WAS HIGHER THEN THE COST OF THE SUGAR.;negative
Being a Southerner, I have enjoyed real apple cider. This is nowhere near in taste.  Very weak...don't know what to do to make it better.;negative
"Skip it! Container is cheap ugly cardboard ..little baggie of candy is anything but ""old fashioned"" in flavor. Not ""gift-worthy"" and not enough to serve guests at home.... keep looking.";negative
got screwed all bottles less than half empty to little for to much;negative
Flour all over everything in the box.  Busted bag.;negative
Didn't really care for these more like a dry tic tax than anything.;negative
Nothing to write about. Mediocore candy.;negative
This is obviously a matter of taste. In my view, if you like sickeningly artificially sweetened beverages with chemically artificial flavors, this is for you. If not, stick to plain bottled water.;negative
Just tasted a bit off so I gave it away the lady and her family liked it.;negative
Not organic like the larger one I had preciously ordered... and, plastic bottle vs. glass.;negative
Horrible tasting! NO ONE will drink it in my family. Totally bummed I wasted the money.;negative
This is the great quality beef jerky and like this flavor all but the fact that it is burn your toung off hot even with a glass of milk my toung is still burning.;negative
"Wierd peach-like 'flavor' .  Eating too many at a time causes some rather undesirable internal effects (i.e, gas & diarrhea) on occasion as well!
Won't be getting it again!";negative
Very disappointed, these tasted like straight cocoa powder and food coloring! =/;negative
Made from whole new potatoes....MADE from ??;negative
Package arrived and the product was moldy.;negative
not my favorite coconut water as it doesn't taste natural enough for me. I've tried many and this is not the one for me;negative
They were ok. But didn't seem real fresh. I ate them but they weren't the best raw cashews I've ever had. Would not buy again.;negative
I didn't care for the taste, and they were too hard to chew.;negative
Don't know what the problem is, but a few of the nuts have a gasolline taste.  Into the trash they go.;negative
I was very disappointed. I've had good luck with Starwest herbs before but this dill weed was old and tasteless. I ended up throwing it out.;negative
a little bitter for my taste gonna have to return it i tried though;negative
Was not too crazy about this product.  Hardly any flavor....went back to my old coffee choice.;negative
Coffee not very fresh and had no particular flavor. Will not buy it again.;negative
Flavor ok. Didn't taste chocolatey. Probably will not buy again.;negative
this is terrible  not much taste  not very sweet  way too thin  I would never buy it again  beware!;negative
"Two out of the four boxes I ordered had partially whitened candies that were rock hard.
Several more candies turned to mush within a month.  This didn't happen with another batch
I bought several years ago.";negative
Tastes like plain old grape juice with a funny metallic aftertaste.  I actually threw out the last can.;negative
"NOT red laces. It's just a giant bag of Twizzler Pull n' Peels.

I'm sure they can't be returned, so I'm just going to light the bag on fire. What a let down.";negative
This does not taste just like Pad Thai. It's a very poorly done version and I prefer regular Ramen to this. I won't be getting it again and will have trouble finishing the rest of the case.;negative
i do care for it it does not aha a strawberry taste;negative
i cannot comment on quality because the box was left by the door on a rainy night. The samples looked small especially the bread.;negative
Not a whole bean in the entire bag . coffee grinds and pieces of whole beans . will not buy again;negative
It's not the best...won't buy again.;negative
Not happy that it contains artificial sweetner;negative
First time  user....noticed the expiration on side is 01/2016...conveniently covered over.....No way to do business!;negative
Terrible flavor. Lots of plastic taste. I ordered several cases so my non-coffee-drinking hubby could enjoy our pod coffee maker, but no such luck. These were not good.;negative
Did not like it at all.  Very strong & bitter, left horrible taste in my mouth.  This is first time I tried coffee I was not familiar with from Amazon.  Will only order coffees I am familiar with from now on.;negative
it doesn't state artificial flavorings in the ingredients list on Amazon.....but they are listed on the box.  Not for me because of the artificial ingredients, but my husband likes the taste.;negative
Bought these to replace new formula Quest Bars.  These were horrible, all flavors.  Especially the weird coating.  Would not buy again.  :(;negative
Not a very good flavor, if you like a weird yogurt texture in your chocolate then it will be perfect for you, however for me I'll stick with the original hazelnut milka instead.;negative
I have no idea why the regular Chef Boyardee beef ravioli tastes so much better than this overstuffed version. There is just no comparison.;negative
Tiny package,  way over priced.  It is to be included in a Christmas gift.  I hope they taste good!;negative
These are very hard and crunchy so they tend to break into a lot of crumbs when you eat them. The taste was pretty plain. Will not buy again.;negative
pure sugar, fruit if their is any is just a medium for the sugar. Candy would be better def.;negative
Would it buy it again. Nuts were soft inside. Wasn't stored properly i guess.;negative
I love love love Donut Shop Coffees.  But this stuff tastes bad.  Stick with Original, it's awesome!!!;negative
Bought these to add to a trail mix, but they did not really taste good, somewhat hard to swallow as they had an aftertaste from the preservatives.;negative
I loved these but the last couple in the case I bought had big lumps in them that didn't dissolve when shaking, then I got one that was completely rancid. I just don't trust them anymore.;negative
Very grainy.  Leaves quite a residue on my glasses and has a bit of a funny after taste.  I've had better.;negative
Perhaps you can expain the 32.1% increase in90 days?;negative
These are way to strong unless you love wasabi taking your breath away!;negative
"These must come from a back room in the warehouse. The ""Best Buy"" date was February 2017. I ordered in July 2017.";negative
"Has that sour preservatives taste and needs to be washed out thoroughly to make it bearable.
Very expensive too for what you get. They're just noodles, lol.";negative
wild selections solid white albacore tuna in water. not worth the money.;negative
Strange texture, not sure what to do with it.;negative
"Didn't work at all for me, and I'm quite experienced with bread, including sourdough, salt rising, and other breads. Nope.

Reduced from two stars to one.";negative
good price, but I did not liked some of the tastes and the quality of some of them.;negative
Was not as good as other products I have bought from Frontier.;negative
I eat alot of soup, this soup has very large chunks of potatoes, BUT it has a weird chemical taste. Almost like the bacon flavor is chemically induced...THIS IS THE WORST CAMPBELL SOUP I HAVE EVER TASTED.;negative
not my favorite GF product.  a bit too cheesy for me.  some may enjoy it though.;negative
Not crisp....kind of on the wet side.;negative
"Weak and tasteless don't bother trying
Even with 2 bags";negative
Not impressed I've had other brands with better taste;negative
Not edible at all. Why buy a product with zero everything and it taste like wood. What a waste of money.;negative
It tastes absolutely disgusting. nothing like maple syrup consistency and it has an off taste than I was expecting. the aftertaste is horrible, too. I wouldn't recommend it.;negative
three of the four crtons were crushed or torn open, the outer box had no damage so hese had to be packed that way. Not happy with this delivery;negative
I bought this hoping that it would be a good iced tea.  You have to put the setting on the smallest cup size and it really has very little taste.  I was really sorry I ordered this tea and wasted my money.;negative
IMMEDIATELY after receiving this item i threw it in the trash unopened. There is a warning on the back of the package stating that it contains heavy metals that are known to cause cancer. REALLY??!;negative
Did not like this one.  I had to throw them out.;negative
Sorry but did not like the taste or consistency;negative
serves it purpose but if you want to be healthy, you should limit this product like you do sweets.;negative
I like the chips but not that flavor;negative
Hard to get the wrappers off as the candy is sticky. Finally just threw the whole box away having used only about 10% of it.;negative
Very disappointed. Poor coffee flavor and tastes like the paper that the pods are made of. I enjoy Sumatra coffee and this doesn't even come close. I will be exploring different manufacturers.;negative
Sorry, but for me, it was too bland...;negative
Words fail me to describe the flavor, or I should say lack of it. Didn't expect home made taste but this stuff is bad!;negative
Melted previously, but thx Amazon for the refund when the vendor didn't support. Taste was ok but they were horribly disfigured/flat. Watch out for sharp edges if giving to kids.;negative
Not that great. This comes with a ton of popcorn that just doesn't taste that great. I'd rather get the lays bold variety pack of chips.;negative
Other than the good flavor we did not enjoy these. Hard as a rock, had to throw them out.;negative
BEST COFFEE ON THE MARKET.  HAVE IT EVERY MORNING.  REALLY LIKE THE EASE OF USE;negative
Not good, not soft, no moisture left in fruit, in short stale old figs;negative
"it's not what I expected, didn't like it. ""Not my cup of tea"", so to speak.";negative
These tasted awful so I gave them to my neighbor who says she likes them.;negative
Didn't realize they are made with corn syrup. not keeping them.;negative
It seems to have a slight chemical taste. I am not a fan;negative
I'm sorry to say that mine came completely hard and unless I heat it up, I can't squeeze it out at all. Basically unuseable. Taste was good.;negative
The cherry jello is good but is overridden by hard chunks of fruit.;negative
While I really love their other products, this one and the sweet potato don't hydrate well and remain too chewy for my tastes. I prefer buying these 2 fresh.;negative
These were way too spicy for us. Left a burning taste. Used in a pepper grinder.  Amazon is being kind enough to refund ud after we return product. Was looking forward to these.;negative
The scones were just OK and not something I'd likely take time to buy or make again.;negative
Why would you make this so sweet? Put a warning label for the people who like tea not the sickly sweetness - what a way to ruin tea for me.;negative
Awful, not like any other ginger snap I've had and I am a big fan of them. They tasted like ginger straight off the spice rack. Couldn't even for myself to eat them after spending so much.;negative
Sorry to all the positive ratings... these were dirty... tasted like gritty sand.  I literally had to WASH them first.  Not worth it.  Not interested in returning them but would never buy them again.;negative
Not all it was supposed to be, too  much rice and very dry.;negative
"These jelly beans may be ""sugar"" free but they still had a boat load of carbs. I am very disappointed in spite of the good flavor.";negative
Less satisfied with TH than previous purchases.;negative
Not a whole heck of alot of cherrys in a CHERRY pie;negative
Love and B&J's but not this flavor---too much going on;negative
Disappointed. Not very chocolaty, grainy, not much flavor. Too much sugar. I will NOT buy this again.;negative
Don't like the flavor and all the liquid in it.;negative
White only one star because they expired too quick;negative
Three jerky eaters in my house and no one will touch this stuff. I can't give it away.;negative
Disappointed. Not a good dill pickle flavor.;negative
Sometimes you get what you pay for. This time Free is what it is worth.  It has a nasty after taste and sounds like a bad idea from the get go. . .and it is;negative
Dont buy this in bulk (30 in one box).  Over half of the were broken.;negative
Didn't like the taste or quality(low grade) Deeply disappointed.;negative
I was out of my regular brand so tried this.  It is very spicy, but has a definite fishy smell and taste.  As I generally use this in cooking chicken with coconut milk it doesn't work for me.;negative
"Zero star for the low-quality teas. The jasmine is fragrant but extremely bitter. The white tea, in theory mild, has no taste. I am too discouraged to try others.

The 1-star is for the fancy packaging.";negative
Bunch of water no fillings may as well be awful progresso. WHERES THE SOUP?;negative
Alot discolored nuts. You cant really just pour a handful without picking out bad nuts. I won't reorder.;negative
A little pricey compared to vanilla or strawberry;negative
Flackers is not what the doctor ordered. Although it is in a pretty package, the texture is more gummy when chewing than crisp. May be a personal preference, but I will not purchase again.;negative
I bought this coffee because of a recommendation of a friend and while it's okay I'll just be making it occasionally for myself to drink. Will only buy the sample size of unknown coffees from now on.;negative
I ordered the small packets NOT this big bag that will take forever to use and I have no where to store. Thank you.;negative
Very, very thin and watery. I threw it out. Honey Tree brand, also sold here, is much, much better.;negative
Had other brands in past, more chewy than crisp.  Would not purchase again. I have added to this post several times to allow me to submit.  It is what it is.;negative
Plain.  Don't like. Will not buy again;negative
I bought this for my husband because he likes strong, Colombian type coffees.  This one is just okay.  It's more of a medium roast.  Not a bad flavor, but not strong and bold as advertised.;negative
Tried this multiple times and it just clumps. Tried to add ingredients in different order. Ill never buy this product again;negative
EW EEW EEWW...bacon flavors/smoky flavors do not belong with coconut.  If you love bacon, stay away from this!;negative
I do not like these. They died very quickly, and there was nothing I could do about it. I expected they would last...;negative
I was disappointed in it not being able to taste the maple. Bolder than I thought it would be. Overall it was ok, but won't get again.;negative
I wanted to love it. However it was so bitter I couldn't eat it. It's a wonderful idea but perhaps if it had some more Stevia in it or something it wouldn't be quite so bitter.;negative
Way too sweet. I wouldn't recommend :(;negative
I usually love this corn. This bottle was completely stale, and it's not cheap.;negative
No one in the house liked. To salty;negative
It had the taste of ice tea powder, like Lipton...I did not like it at all;negative
"I usually buy Sprouts coconut cream and it separates out in the fridge (which I want), this didn't.
I will continue to buy my Sprouts coconut cream, thank you.";negative
Taste aweful.  Cheap tv dinner like.;negative
Not what I thought. The product was stale & the expiration date is Dec 2017 today is Oct 2017! Couldn't mail this to my son like I planned too, will get something else;negative
It came all lied together because it obviously got too hot and melted.;negative
This stuff tastes disgustting. I can't even mask it with extra cream and sugar.;negative
Taste was that great plus very hard on your teeth...beware;negative
"If it's not peanut butter, it's dry ""cheese"" crackers.  The cookies were the best part of this package.";negative
"THIS STUFF IS HOT, BUT NOT AS MUCH AS IT IS TOO SALTY!  IT IS LIKE EXTRACT OF SALT.  USELESS PRODUCT
UNLESS YOU DON'T HAVE A SALT SHAKER.  YUCK!";negative
hate it and can't even find anyone to give it away to!;negative
Cinnamon tasted artificial and the rolls did not turn out fluffy for me but rather chewy.  I much rather have the regular chebe bread that you mix cheese into.  Those always turned out great for me.;negative
I asked for flavorless oil, got flavored;negative
These bars are awesome, but I thought I was buying a 12 pack. It's the same price as the 12 pack in other flavors. At my local store they are half the price, so I'll just buy them there.;negative
Matcha Tea should be a bright green in color and fresh in taste. This is neither..;negative
After eating ONLY salad for a week, I made this Carbquick pizza... I only ate 2 slices. To its credit though, it LOOKED delicious;negative
too much salt. poor quality nuts which are hard to find any way in cheap seeds anyway. one of the worst purchase on Amazon;negative
the size of popcorn is good but the date was expired of the product;negative
Since Amazon doesn't list the ingredients, here they are: coconut milk, water, sodium metabisulfite, polysorbate 60, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and guar gum. That alone speaks volumes to me.;negative
Kicked me out of ketosis and made me very I'll! Never again!;negative
Had a waxy taste/feel...did not like them.;negative
I did not like these at all. Thew them away!;negative
Meh. It's not just plain cheese. It has spices on it.;negative
Great idea... A bean based cereal. Maybe another flavor would be better but this was way too sweet. Reminded me of the Fruit Loops my mom used to give us as kids.;negative
Item arrived with the bag cut in a couple of places and pepper corns all over. The external bag was okay, so must have been packed with the cuts in the the bag. Not sanitory at all :(;negative
Not sure if it worked. Did not taste s difference in the final product...coconut milk yogurt.;negative
Wasted my money, I do not like the taste at all.;negative
Odd taste and very expensive, will not buy again.;negative
Bought 3 boxes of Reva packets would be perfect for traveling but I tried 1 packet and it tasted awful, had to give away.;negative
Tastes like it turned. Has a filmy taste.;negative
Some of the items were a bit stale!;negative
Won't be ordering again. Price is $1 per miniature cup.;negative
Has not worked for me.  Very disappointed.;negative
Eh, its okay. I thought imported honey would be even slightly better than what one can find in a local grocery store. I was wrong.;negative
I liked being able to buy in bulk but these must have been shaken around too much...they are slices anymore, they are orange mush.;negative
nasty candy , and the seller was not easy to work with at all .;negative
I've been eating these for a while now, but the last box I ordered tasted old. I'm kind of disappointed with the quality this time.;negative
GAVE IT AWAY TOO FIZZY FAINT GINGER ALE TASTE;negative
"Not very flavorful; can barely taste the violet.";negative
I guess I'm always ordering at wrong times of year, or getting older stock as they always come melted and taste somewhat stale;negative
Old stale product.  Beyond expiration date, not even close.;negative
I soak Brazil nuts in salt water over night. Then rinse them in the morning and eat. About half of these are floating on top of the water in the morning. Troubling.;negative
My diabetic husband didn't care for these. Too bland for him.;negative
do not buy - a waste of money - gastritis is worse than ever- that is just cruel - just something else to peddle;negative
Sugar shell too thick, makes almonds too hard. You're paying mostly for sugar. Almonds should be larger. Ripoff.;negative
Too much fishy flavor for my tastes. It was also kind of gritty? Not a fan.;negative
Jeez I had no idea how much candy this was. Definitely not the sour I was looking for. More of a sweet taste.;negative
Did not like vegetable taste . Expected more fruit flavor..;negative
Horrible stevia aftertaste. I don't remember I had eaten something worse. Stevia tastes as a s....;negative
Hard as a rock!  Even boiling water would not reduce the clumps to liquid/cream.  May have been due to winter freezing weather temperatures but...unusable and I'm requesting a refund.;negative
The bag is labeled as pictured but the flavor is not pecan.  Maybe I got a bag filled with the wrong flavored coffee.;negative
The mints in the container I received were not soft or puffy and seemed stale and had very little flavor.  I was unable to give them away once someone tasted one.;negative
Despite the Amazon description, this item is NOT organic. That alone is a deal-breaker.;negative
Horrible!  You can't roll them as they fall apart when you try. They are too thick, which makes the flavor over power anything in the wrap.;negative
"Not at all ""dark"" in flavor or color.  More like milk chocolate - and artificial tasting at that.";negative
Tastes like coconut BUT awfully dry And hard- ended up as an offering to the squirrels in my back yard;negative
These bunnies were so tiny I had no idea they were hollow and that small very disappointed;negative
The inside product was none to fresh red sauce.  Though I like this brand in the grocery store, the quality was nothing near something to eat.  I throw them away one at a time for emphasis.;negative
I couldn't tolerate the taste in my coffee but for others it might be more acceptable.;negative
I opened one jar of this, tasted it, then gave the rest away. I expected chocolate-flavored peanut butter, not chocolate spread with a faint peanut flavor. Good idea, bad execution.;negative
TERRIBLE!  This changed the taste of the icing.  We had to toss the icing and make over.  Would NOT recommend.  Very disappointed.;negative
Tasted strangely bland and like cheap peanut butter after two chews. Not sure if a bad batch but never tasted a marcona like it. Probably going to try and give it away I guess.;negative
"I am very disappointed that they started putting High Fructose Corn Syrup in this ""so called"" Classic Dentyne...ruins it for me! Won't purchase it again until they stop using fake alternative.";negative
don't waste your money.  this product is awful!;negative
I want to like this product! I just can't get over the price that it's twice as much as other equally fine offerings. And why is it so difficult to see the weight of this product in the pictures offered;negative
Received defective bottle and can't get help from the seller.;negative
Tastes ok but very oily. It was 'runny' which is odd for peanut butter and threw the consistency off.;negative
I returned this because it was almost all black pepper, with just a few of other colors. Save yourself some money and get multi color pepper at Smart & Final.;negative
Not all that great of an item.  Tasted bad;negative
I love some of the other bars, but this one....I didn't like nor did my son that's ask;negative
'Zulera' was my seller, for some reason this batch had a strong solvent based upon opening the bag, afraid to eat them;negative
Overpriced. Wish I had read the other reviews. Little to no peanuts just a sugary tasteless brittle. Wish I had made my own the microwave.;negative
I have to use way more than what they say is equal to a teaspoon of sugar to get a teaspoon's worth of sweet! Other products are more economical.;negative
Kabanosy are one of my favorite sausages. They are supposed to be dry and were advertised as such. They were not dry. The flavor was OK.  This is not  the traditional kabanosy - it is an imitation.;negative
I'm still trying this coffee but to me so far the taste is just not very good.  It is a strong taste which is great but I don't know how to describe it, the taste just isn't very good.;negative
Arrived with an expired date by 2 months.  Tried them anyway because I don't like sending things back and they were stale. Don't bother ordering them!;negative
This was our first time trying the unsweetened kind. We found it thin & watery, with not much flavor. Disappointing.;negative
"I used to love this stuff. Recently got another box and don't know if theres something wrong with this batch or if my tastebuds changed; it doesnt taste like anything anymore. Bummer.";negative
these cakes where very dry this not how this panettone is to be they are a soft moist bread like cake that is very tasty;negative
taste nasty. like garbage or toothpaste;negative
Worthless unless you want it for a coating or breading...completely crushed to dust.;negative
It is described as organic but no where on the bottle does it state this product is organic. don't be fooled;negative
I like these kind a lot,  however,  this package I received through Amazon tasted old.;negative
Arrived already fermenting - fresh day but rotting.;negative
Hated it!  Our family did not like any of these flavors...;negative
Ridiculously short best by date. Received package on December 4, and its best by date is December 26. Yes, thats right, only 3 weeks. Cannot recommend. Coffee tastes stale.;negative
Was expired when I received them!  Had to throw them out!  Will never purchase them again.;negative
"Tastes kind of artificial, not as good as some off the shelf nationwide grocery store brands.
Made in the US, not Australian licorice by any stretch.";negative
This works, but the stars are few because the price is ridiculously high.;negative
These cutlets are super thin and very greasy. The oil that comes off these when cooked is insane. Also very dry inside.  two orders and both times the expiration date was a day out. Never again.;negative
"I would not recommend this!
Better off with REAL BUTTER!";negative
Contains High Fructose Corn Syrup!  YOOHOO, people don't like that stuff anymore.  Please consider alternatives.;negative
I really wanted to like this protein mix! It has a strong chalky taste and smell.  I would NOT recommend this protein mix to anyone.  Get Orgain it is much better.;negative
if you have dental treasures like crowns or fillings...avoid;negative
The liquid in this product includes juice other than from peaches. Because I have allergies to some of the other juices, I disposed of the product rather than consume it.;negative
They changed the types of chocolate coffees, and you no longer get the same ones.  My favorite, chocolate chipotle mole is gone and replaced with peanut butter coffee.  Ugh.  Yuck!;negative
Not very tasty and not worth the price.;negative
I was expecting this to be at least something like espresso which it is not. I compared it to the fresh roast and the frenh is way stronger with better taste.;negative
"bought 2 packs of 6.
both have to go into trash because upon opening powder is greyish color, not dark dark brown....
very sad....";negative
Delicious, but you get a total of six pieces.;negative
Good peach taste, but it leaves that stevia after taste I don't like. Also a bit too sweet for me!  A matter of taste!;negative
CORN SY RUP USED FOR THE XYLITROL NO GOOD FOR ME;negative
Bought these in December 2013 as part of a Christmas gift to my husband. He did like the flavor, but he said the texture was off putting.;negative
An organic drink loaded with caffeine. For a sick person, a disaster. I wanted probiotics and other goodness, not be kept awake for days.;negative
"These ""cookies"" (actually small round discs) were spicy with ginger and gave me heartburn.  Sadly, I ended up throwing them away.";negative
"The ""meat"" has a creamy texture like biting into a stick of brie cheese.  Principal ingredient is pured cow hearts.  Each stick has 14% of the USDA daily fat allowance.  I wouldn't feed it to my dog.";negative
What the heck do you use this with.  It doesn't taste like anything.  Had these trees growing in my yard for years, had no idea the fruit was usable.;negative
Very light cheddar taste, and that's putting it respectfully. You're better off getting another flavor.;negative
Way too sweet for a BBQ rub. I guess it would be okay if you like that kind of thing.;negative
Ok but they leak grounds and only OK on flavor. I won't reorder.;negative
Deceiving description because its a mixture of various, unnamed juices.  The color looks like it might contain carrot juice.  Not what I got in the recent past.  Why not just tell people whats in it?;negative
Don't care for this one...strange aftertaste.  Won't be buying it again.;negative
arrived dried out  - put in sun and watered every 3 days - its dead... am disappointed;negative
They are hard as a rock and not very much wintergreen flavor.  I used to get these when I was a kid and they were very flavorable with the  wintergreen.;negative
Not any flavor of raspberry at all.  A huge disappointment and waste of money.  They were soft, as advertised, but that was their only good quality.  Will not buy again.;negative
very inconsistant textures some stale many flavors listed might be just one, others missing. mostly peppermint.;negative
Very dry and crumbly.  The Cocoa Crispy cookies are much better I think.;negative
These were not very good. Some down right nasty. Skip these if you have taste buds. Definatly would not buy again.;negative
Tragicaly, it does not taste great.  Not exactly fair trade because it just aint fair.  I prefer a strong coffee flavored drink, this is strong but is oily and bitter.  Dissapointment.;negative
could be way cheaper. If you're buying for baskets, get these in bulk elsewhere. I didn't taste them, I just needed hem for bulk.;negative
Stevia sweetner is not to my liking.  Flavoring is barely noticeable.  Needs a greater concentration of flavor if they're going to sell it in such a small bottle.;negative
Horrible product! Have no idea what's in it, but Mango isn't one of them. Order wood chips, might taste better! No JOKE!!;negative
My last shipment is full of bugs, I'm enclosing pictures. The package hasn't been opened by bag, bugs are inside the bag. It's absolutely disgusting.;negative
My box only had 38 (not the 40 promised) k-cups included. And it was packaged in an herbal tea box that had been taped back together. So disappointing!;negative
The expiry date is Jan 15, 2015. I ordered this just a few weeks ago, so this is very out of date coffee they are supplying! Will try coffee tomorrow and report further.;negative
The best gluten free/dairy free chocolates!  They're absolutely delicious!  You can't tell they're gluten and dairy free!;negative
No blueberries, I won't buy this again.  Very sad.;negative
Remember wallpaper paste.  Similar texture and I imagine tastes the same.  We made gluten free treats for the dog out of it. I like most other Bob's Red Mill products but not this one.;negative
I was expecting lots more heat, but these have hardly any.  The taste is pleasant, but I bought these for a spicy kick.  Didn't get that. Disappointed;negative
Meh.  Doesn't really add much for flavor, doesn't seem useful.;negative
Have to use three times as much as advertised. In order to get the equivalency of a packet of splenda I need to use 3 drops;negative
"I do not like this flavor. Will not get again. Tastes klike dirty dishes.
not what I expected at all.";negative
Very weak flavor. I think the shipment was adequatly sealed and set on the shelf for a long time. I spent a while in Turkey and have never tasted pistachios with such poor weak taste.;negative
The bag seemed light and so we weighed it!! It was only 2  and one half pounds! We counted them out and they were 30 short! Not an honest company!;negative
Nothing but almond and peanuts. Pistachios were rotten and all the nuts were rancid. No walnuts, just a few small pieces of pecan. Very disappointed.;negative
Made of manufacture is 14 months ago.  Are you kidding me?  Returning.;negative
Not a great taste. Does not taste like a high quality tea. I don't want to drink it, and cannot be returned.;negative
Xylitol made from birch trees is easy on the stomach. This is not. It's made from corn. Tore  me up about an hour after consumption.  Buy another brand.;negative
A poor imitation of the real stuff, not worth the money, buy Italian or don't bother.;negative
"Arrived stale!  Stale Butterfingers, ugh the worst kind. 11.5 oz for 10.99 is a real ripoff, could have bought a full box of 36 full size butterfingers for $20.49. Don't buy !!!  couldn't give ""O"" STARS.";negative
Very Disappointed....the bag it is delivered in kind of crush the toffee off the cashews....not as tasty as I thought...wouldn't buy again;negative
Warning.  We are now feeding this to the birds.  Maybe people in the North like it but it is not for people in the South.  We usually love Bob's Red Mill products but not this one.;negative
These are the most disgusting things I've ever tasted. There is barely a peppermint taste. It's just chalky fake sweetness. BAD.;negative
nasty tasting - full of unnecessary ingredients and definitely nothing like the real thing! Definitely not worth the price nor the hassle!;negative
I am not happy with this purchase. I thought I was buying chili powder mix to make chilli.;negative
Very dry, tasteless and very little salt. I've never had disgusting almonds until now.;negative
Dont buy them, sour like sour patch kids. Yuck! Waste of money.;negative
Not one person in the family liked the taste.;negative
i love this, but too too expensive!;negative
It is a big bag for teapot not for a cup of tea. Not easy to store either;negative
This tea tastes like water, it does not steep cold at all and even when I added hot water, I needed at least 2 bags to get a cup of decent concentration.;negative
I was so looking forward to trying these but it arrived with corrosion all over the top. I can only assume it leaked and the salt reacted with the metal. I had to toss it. :(;negative
The sweetener in this gum gave me almost instant diarrhea.  I cannot recommend it.;negative
I think that Designer Whey must have changed their formula because this tasted worse than usual. Too much of the fake sweet flavor.;negative
Jack Links' turkey jerky is so delicious. This stuff is dry and stringy. Do not like. I might end up putting it in soup or something.;negative
Very nearly cut myself when I opened this in it's bubble envelope.  So now I have an envelope of loose curry and glass.  It was an Amazon pack job.  House smells delicious tho'.;negative
I wish I knew that there was a California label in the back of the package stating  (that the Chemical inside the package is known to cause Cancer).  All these 5 stars , some inconsiderate People :(.......;negative
Just be sure you know you're paying a lot for mostly Erythritol, not Monkfruit.  For the price, I prefer the benefits and taste of Amazon's birch xylitol;negative
This oil is not green the way it's supposed to be. The bottle makes it look green. I don't like it. Fake product baja precious;negative
Smallest bag iv ever seen! Havent even tried it yet. Just got it in but I was shocked how small the bag was.;negative
the lavender oil tasted soapy.  none were very good as flavoring.;negative
"In one word HORRIBLE! Through them away immediately.  Composition unkind; no flavor to mention.

Worst candy I ever had.  Never again";negative
I was so happy when I received the Millet flour but really disappointed when I open the first bag it was loaded with bugs all the bags had bugs;negative
What a rip off.  You get no more than a little jelly jar full of popcorn oil.  I cannot believe I paid this for what amounts to maybe 1 1/2 cups of oil;negative
Terrible tasting -- don't waste your money -- pouring it down the drain today.;negative
They melt away and stick to the plastic wrapping they're in if you don't eat them right away;negative
I am vegan and this product contains milk;negative
Bought three gallons, all three went bad 9 days before the experation date printed on the bottle.;negative
WHY DID THIS ARRIVE IN LITTLE INDIVIDUAL CHEAP BAGS? Ifelt as if I was paying for sampler bags and paying full price . Look for blooming tea elsewhere people.;negative
Janet was all melted maybe if you ship to Florida that needs to be wintertime my mistake as well;negative
Good product and taste awesome but not as much juice as expected. Got like 6 glasses out of it.;negative
To many unhealthy additives. Will not buy again.;negative
Did not care for this gum did not hold flavor and to expensive;negative
"flavor lasts 30 secs and BLOATS - beware
OK to clean teeth and spit out";negative
I hoped I had found a winner from the other reviews but I found this to be too light in flavor so I am going to continue my search for good local marzipan.;negative
I just don't like these.  Dry and the taste isn't good.  Lots of other choices, like the power bar peanut butter cookie.;negative
Yuck.  These have a really weird aftertaste.  Bummed because orange tic tacs are so yummy.  These got thrown away.;negative
I ordered the black garlic, and got the Pinot Noir. What the heck?;negative
Very bad flavor. Overwhelmingly sweet.;negative
Tastes more like molded cheese instead of white cheddar;negative
don't know if we got a bad jar but we got sick. never would buy this again. apparently you can get food poisoning from raw honey.;negative
Very messy. Arrived with sucker pieces everywhere all over the display box. Many are broken and very busted up. Nervous to eat these as they look old.;negative
Mine also arrived in a lump. No fun;negative
they are so thin that I would be ashamed to serve them to company;negative
they are very dry and more gritty than I thought.;negative
It did not work,,idk enough about this ,,so i had to give it a 1 star,,;negative
"***Updated from my May 2017 review
09.15.17 I know good and well they did not send me expired water!  At this price, this subscription now ENDS!";negative
Good price, but small and cheap granola, bars. Not real tasty;negative
THIS IS JUST A VERY SALTY FLAVORLESS LIQUID AND NOT AT ALL LIKE SOY SAUCE.;negative
I had never tried it before and was expecting it to have at least a bit of pumpkin flavor.  It didn't .  It tasted much like peanut butter which I am not overly fond of.;negative
Most of the candy in the box has crystalized. Have found 3 good slices so far out of the 5 lb box. Very disappointed;negative
"These jolly ranchers were OLD.
They were rock hard- I know jolly ranchers are a hard candy but these were extra hard. They also stuck to the wrapper and were almost impossible to unwrap. I tossed them";negative
Bottles were bloated indicating poor storage. Concerned about leached plastic as a result. Not sure about quality, Fiji water is great, but these particular bottles seemed defective...;negative
The entire package was sticky and unusable.  Very disappointed.;negative
Mint infusion is overwhelming with this brand.;negative
Not as filled as they once were. Disappointing.;negative
These taste terrible. I don't understand why you would buy it when normal baked chips have almost the same low calorie count.;negative
They only sent 3 packs and they are all a bit too sweet for my taste...the jerky isn't bad though...just not good imo;negative
Works as stated and wraps good. Texture like eating wax paper and gets oily as it warms up in your hands. Won't buy this again. Had high hopes...;negative
I suppose I should not have been surprised, but it's quite sweet.  Cranberry implies tart, but I suppose the apple supplies sweetness.  If you like sweet in what should be a savory dish, you might like it.;negative
Out of all these teas only the peach mango was good. The rest were extremly strong and bitter. Wont buy again.;negative
1st order was broken all too pieces. Replacement order was broken & 2 were dead.;negative
the box we got will expire in one (1) month???  first off I did not know dry mix KOOL-AID expired...;negative
Nice mix, but the jelly beans were rather hard.;negative
The label is deceptive. A single serve bottle should be labeled as one serving. When I looked closely this had twice as much sugar than I thought.;negative
These arrived a melted, liquid mess....I am sure they would have tasted much better had they not been melted first.;negative
First of all, it is small package for $10 I paid for. The color is darker and tastes like oxidized tea. It just tastes off.;negative
tastes like RC cola, NOT Coca-Cola Zero. Don't be fooled, and don't fool yourself.;negative
I don't really like it. Tastes too artificial.;negative
Good price but the chips were crumbles up.;negative
it arrived on time buttttttttt.  its rancid.;negative
All of the k-cups were dark roast. Based on the photo, I thought it was more half and half (light/medium and dark). I spent a long time looking for a package that was a mix of medium roast. Way too dark!;negative
I should give this pie one star! Complete waste.. didn't eat.. all sugary and no real taste as advertised...;negative
Hardly any licorice  ,really small bags. Not worth the price;negative
The pods do not seal very well, even with the use of an electric pod sealer, and it may just be the construction of the filter, or the type of sealant.;negative
They have pits and I need to learn how to remove them for pitted dates.;negative
"I have no idea what you'd call the actual flavor of this gum, but it most definitely was NOT wintergreen. ""Disgusting"" would be a lot closer to what it actually tastes like.";negative
Read the reviews & went with it. Bad idea this time. Nothing special, quite hard to chew & little flavor !!;negative
Worst tasting creamer I have ever had. Just yuck. Threw it out.;negative
Gave them a try. I did not like it. There are better mints out there.;negative
These pecans were old, dry and bitter, not something I want to eat. So sad, because I  love fresh, tender pecans and I was hoping ....;negative
Too many calories and too little flavor.;negative
Tastes terrible, so bad I couldn't even get my roommates to drink this stuff when I told the house it was a free for all.  Nobody had a noticeable increase in energy or anything.  Just a gross gimmick.;negative
over salted for salty and I like salty really hard and not very good;negative
"Did not care for the ""plastic"" taste of this product. Would not purchase it again";negative
Taste is bland, no actual fruit flavor, disappointed;negative
Disappointed.... this is not a concentrate or powder you add water to. This is a ready to serve liquid, only 2 small servings (8 oz ea). The taste is very bland and almost tasteless.;negative
Its more on the chalky side, rather than chocolate or peanut butter side or both.  Take the chalkiness away, make it richer, then you have a good and better product.;negative
Didn't really like these, not much flavor.;negative
"Don't be fooled by ""whole grains"" -- read the fine print. I was turned off by sugar, wheat, and 35 grams of carbs in 1/3 cup. It was a free sample.  I put it in a big box of stuff to give away.";negative
Won't grow in Ohio, couldn't even get to sprout indoors;negative
"Ad states that this is 12 packs of 6; but all I received is 6 individual packets.";negative
Not really that sweet, plus gave me diarrhea. Xilitol much better....;negative
It is easy to apply, but I am not so sure about the idea of Broth Concentrate. Good that it is reduced sodium, but it does not taste as good as regular beef broth, unfortunately.;negative
Kind of flavorless to me, and way over priced for what you get.;negative
This is a misleading product. It is not pure Stevie Extract. It has a lactose filler in it. It states on the container that 1/3 tsp is equal to 1 tsp. Of sugar. The real thing is 1 tsp. = 1 cup of sugar.;negative
The noodles had a very weird texture and the broth was not tasty.  I couldn't finish 1 cup of this soup.;negative
Did not like the taste. Gave it to a vegan friend of mine.;negative
I love these bars. Chock full of healthy ingredients. This is my favorite flavor. I love that is made with agave. All that being said they were all melted greasy on the outside. Won't by them again online;negative
These are VERY VERY SUGARY. Almost nauseatingly so. If they were less sweet, would like them better. Nice texture.;negative
So brutally dark I couldn't stand it. Not sure why the heck I ordered an entire box of this stuff.;negative
Smells terrible. Had to throw it away.;negative
This coffee has a weak, muddy flavor.  I would not purchase it again.  The price was good, but I would not recommend this coffee.;negative
Too sweet. Not pickle-y enough. Oh well.;negative
"My bad I didn't notice ""double"" in description.  This was way too strong and bitter for me and I tried steeping it less. Didn't enjoy at all...";negative
I am a tea lover I drink tea everyday, but this tea was just weird. It smells like liquid smoke and tastes like when you smoke meat but no meat flavor. Very odd tea.;negative
No up to Bistos usual standard, too much thickening and not enough flavor, I  do not intend to buy again;negative
Doesn't taste as good as the brands in the glass bottles, but I can at least put it in my purse.;negative
Not happy, I trusted Terrasoul as i buy their Cashews often and never had a problem. I hate to say it but These almonds however are Terrible!  Most are dry, about 10 to 20% are bad/rancid.;negative
Really gritty. Get Maqui Powder instead.;negative
They were crusty and dry, with white salt like crystals falling out of the bottom of the bag.  There was a small hole in the bag as well.  Opened the bag and it smelled terrible.;negative
very odd flavor combinations, does not taste very good.;negative
"this ia a good idea; however, difficult to open.  must squeeze/twist pretty hard & product oozes free - usually all over fingers.  also, portion size is a bit too small.  still love agave.";negative
Product is sweetened with Coconut and not as described.;negative
Way to much cumin and not enough chilies.  To much rice to many kinds of beans.  I will give the other two varieties at try but not expecting them to be any better.;negative
Partially hydrogenated vegetable oil? Very annoying. I liked these until I read this ... no thanks!;negative
Solid / Clumpy / Simply coffee grounds mixed with honey / Nothing Special;negative
This posting is misleading.  It claims to have no salt.  Just got mine in and guess what the first ingredient listed: SALT!  Avoid this product if you are cutting back on salt.;negative
Resolve and Dawn leaked all over...had to throw away.;negative
I brewed a cup of this today, and it appeared as if there was tea coming out of the cup.  It is not very strong.  I hope that maybe it was a bad K-cup.;negative
Did not taste like curry, did not taste like coconut, could not find any shitake mushrooms and the chicken was dry. Tasted more like bell peppers than anything else. Would not recommend to anyone.;negative
They are soaked in very greasy oil. Ruin the fish.;negative
This does not come with a certified organic seal, deceptive advertising.;negative
"MEH. My kid hated them
Wound up giving them away at school";negative
Coffee was very weak after being perked.  Not good at all.  Would  not purchase  this one again.;negative
The taste lasts exactly 2 minutes. After that, you may as well be chewing cardboard.;negative
didn't really digest well for me. won't buy it again. but then again my stomach is pretty sensitive so i'd say at least try it for yourself. i try not to eat too much refined cereals anymore in general.;negative
The one good thing about this product is that it contained a good quantity of seaweed (i.e., 50). However, these were not very flavorful.;negative
I am not a fan!  They left a weird residue in the bowl and in my mouth...  Won't order again...;negative
not very fragrant at all, and had a piece of tattered plastic that looked like perhaps a torn finger of a glove in with the spice powder. Would not recommend.;negative
Read the ingredients it has some other chemical in it, so to me that is not RAW! Leaves an after taste for me like diet drinks does;negative
"Pros: It is super well packaged and does not need to be refrigerated.
Cons: It tastes like canned fish, not like standard smoked salmon. This is not bad per so but does not justify the price.";negative
Save your money get your popcorn at the grocery store;negative
Fake cinnamon. Dont buy anything other than ceylon cinnamon.;negative
Do not like this flavor very much. Prefer others and so do members of my family. Will probably have to throw it out.;negative
Too salty - I disposed of it.  Love the flavor but too much salt for me.  I wish this were available in a low or no salt formula.;negative
Pickles were soft when I was expecting crispy.  Did not like, but that's just me.;negative
No flavor at all.  Advertising is pure garbage.  This is Folgers in a cup.;negative
We enjoy a cup of coffee with Bailey's Irish Cream.  We decided to try this Irish Cream flavored coffee.  In our opinion, it seems to have a bitter taste and smell.  This is one of our LEAST favorites.;negative
I also had ordered for back up food storage.  They taste like chemicals.  Hope I never HAVE to eat them.;negative
this is not pure vanilla and i will request a return. very misleading as the ingredients are not immediately identifiable. Added stuff.;negative
was good but didn't receive the rest of my order;negative
Has a string in it so be careful not to swallow it. I was hoping for individual sugar cubes like the ones i had as a child. Flavor is ok, not like i remember though.;negative
Far too hard. Even my dogs didn't like them;negative
Thought I got a cheaper price, but I am wrong. The chocolate fudge is just ok.;negative
This has Dextrose in it and no wonder my blood sugar went up need to sue this company for false advertisement !;negative
Tastes like chemicals. I won't even be using it.;negative
I really wanted to like this because I enjoy cream in my coffee and I was on a very strict diet. I couldn't get past the taste. It's a great idea, just needs something else.;negative
These taste fine but the packaging is *absurd*.  Each packet is maybe two bites, maybe they're about 1/4 of a human-sized snack.  Absurd and tedious and expensive and a waste of packaging materials.;negative
Loaded with pepper. I couldn't eat it.;negative
Not worth the money.  Too much sugar and not enough toffee.;negative
This tea was so badly beaten up by the time it arrived, its like tea powder. Makes the tea look like mud when brewed.;negative
I think you need to require a taste for this product. It wasn't for me!;negative
Always a favorite but this shipment was hard and stale and went right in the garbage disposal...no wonder it was an add on item. Don't waste your money for stale candy.  Boxes even looked old.;negative
Will NEVER buy again. I added a singles Kool-aid packet to try to make it tolerable, but I could not drink it. I am now stuck with 11 bottles. YUCKY!;negative
I did not enjoy one bite. I love Kashi cereal but this is a cookie that doesn't taste great!  It had no taste. 2 stars because it has fiber and it visually looks like a cookie...;negative
I bought these thinking it would be nice for a change. My take on them is EHHHH not that great of a taste. The sugar coating tasts more synthetic than like chocolate.;negative
I just received this not even 10 minutes ago and when I went to open the package, there was white powder everywhere inside the packaging itself. 3 bags were fine but 1 bag had a big gash in the side of it.;negative
Was not happy with texture or taste;negative
I found this tea to be bitter, and it needed some milk to take the edge off.  A coworker recommended it, so I tried it.  I think the Davidson's English Breakfast is a much smoother, more flavorful tea.;negative
They all taste the same. A little flavor and VERY sweet. The candy was hard, so was old, may be the reason for poor flavor.;negative
Received and the box had been wet at one point and the cubes were clumped together.  Not returnable so a waste of $8;negative
BUYER BEWARE!! The description says no added sugar, but there is added HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP. We were fooled by their LIE. Hope you aren't!;negative
Gross,too much low quality chocolate and the bacon was very burnt.;negative
Not soft and pliable like Orville Redenbacher's and we won't order this again.  Going back to Orville next time.  Unfortunately we have 5+ jars yet to use up!;negative
These tasted old and stale. My husband thought these were an imitation of the product not true Whoppers. Chocolate flaked off and did not taste good;negative
Coffee is good but most either will not pass the water through or deposit most of the coffee grounds into the cup.  Will not buy again.;negative
Thought was gluten free package color misleading;negative
I never tasted coconut flavor so bad. I spit it out. I don't know if it was  bad. All I know is that is tasted terrible.;negative
The first gum - in my life - that irritated my mouth and made me feel nauseated.;negative
"I remember the taste being more subtle,  which is why I liked them... and now that I'm

 in my 60's, they stick to my dentures!";negative
Prefer the original in terms of taste and texture.  Not for me, but could be for you.;negative
Don't buy this.  Terrible flavor per my Mexican hot sauce loving spouse.;negative
I thought I'd love it, as I do drink carrot orange blends. This one just has a super weird after taste. It's not at all enjoyable to drink, I'm sorry to say. Had to plug my nose to finish the cup!;negative
This is not a medium roast! Dark & burned;negative
Christine, thank you so much for making things right!! These cookies are awesome!!;negative
I gave it away as it has ingredients in it that I do not want, namely soy. For those who do not care, it may be great!;negative
Tastes awful! I threw it away - does not taste like peach in any way!;negative
I do NOT consider myself an expert...but...this was terrible!  It tasted stale and rancid.  Will never buy it again. Sorry.;negative
Product was advertised as coming in a decorative tin.  I received a cheap squeeze bottle.  Not worth $12.00.  Amazon issued me a credit.;negative
"Both bags were melted to the individual wrappers AND stuck on the inside of the bags.
You cannot tell they are balls they are so deformed and wasted on packaging.";negative
I am sure these are good for a child's pallet as grocery store versions are. However due to Amazon Prime Panty's lack of packing skills each can was crushed and open to the air so to the trash it went.;negative
The taste goes away in seconds and it was hard to chew;negative
"disappointing
will get you some color but no flavor.
Will still use it cause its coconut oil but definitely doesn't deliver";negative
I WANTED TO LIKE IT BUT IT IS DISGUSTING! PRICED A BIT HIGH. FAST SHIPPING.;negative
These are not good! We made them several ways and the texture is ok but they have a funny aftertaste. They are not returnable and we found them cheaper at an Asian market.;negative
The Product dimensions says 4lbs then shipping weight 10.5 oz under that- of course I saw 4lbs and thought wow! that is a lot of candy. BUT its NOT- its 10.5 oz for $11!! Delicious but holy cow- expensive.;negative
I really did not like the taste/consistency of these bars.  I bought them because Amazon had an amazing deal on them and now I think that's because they can't unload them.;negative
Does not have a good taste nor does it flavor to the food taste bland;negative
it's like the red nyquil.  yuck. I bake a lot and from now on will just use food coloring which won't contaminate my cakes with acrid flavors. definitely pass on this one.;negative
it was ok, but I was looking for espresso, I finally found it here on Amazon..Marleys espresso,,Tullys French roast, extra bold seems to be our fav for every day;negative
Gave me stomach cramps.  I threw it out!!!!!!!!!!!  There are a bunch of write-ups about this.  Try Stevia instead.;negative
No flavor. Does not taste like soy milk;negative
I usually order sincerely nuts, never had a bad batch. But ordered these when SN was out of stock. Never again. They're not washed, but definitely treated with something. What a waste.;negative
"Idem was smashed on one side, still useable
but I'm not very happy with the shipping of this idem.";negative
Over roasted nuts, which takes away the taste from the cashew;negative
When i opened one up i was greeted with a horrible gaseous odor ,so i tried another and another,no luck ,my cat turned his nose up too.;negative
I wrote the company to no avail. This was not the real thing. Tasted like black peppercorns and was full of stems and skins. Also took a month to get to us. I can not recommend this product to anyone.;negative
Got the wrong type. Meant to get the plain ones in olive oil ordered with lemon and its gross. No lemon flavor but the flavor it dose have is gross and the quality dose not seem as good as the plain.;negative
"I thought from the reviews these would be tasty.
Turns out they're bland and mushy.
They have a slight ""peppery"" taste.

Disappointed.

Thanks  ...  Ken";negative
Got it because it was supposed to be super hot. I am a pepper head and this was not hot at all. I actually had to add some Blair's 3AM hot sauce to this to make it hotter.;negative
Don't like not impressed at all. Fair tasting nothing fancy here;negative
I did not really care for the taste.;negative
"The sampler I received looked nothing like the picture.
It was like dated Kraft-cheese on reverse-sale.

Avoid it! You would much better at a local gourmet shop, paying
a bit more but it could not be worse.";negative
Simply gross! Slimy and way too salty.;negative
"Horrid tastes.  tried two diff flavors, ugh ! I prefer hawaii made coffee beans and NOW I know why!!
Not able to return and Amazon is failing, is failing previous customer service with returns";negative
Great product.  One problem I had was the package was supposed to have 4 bags of jerky and the box I received only had 3 bags !  Not good !  Expensive product and I was cheated out of 25% of the product;negative
Mine where not fresh and had a lot of shell peace's in nut's that could break a tooth I want be back.;negative
Very weird hybrid of stevia and sparkling water. Won't buy it again.;negative
"I'm diabetic, and bought these because they were included when I did a search on ""diabetic snacks"". Looked good, taste like... well, let's just say that I'll just have to find a different way to enjoy.";negative
Filled with fruit goop. Woud have preferred a solid candy. Think mine were a bit stale too.;negative
We don't eat pork but this sausage has pork casing.  Be very careful if you don't eat pork.;negative
Not much flavor...texture is like soft plastic....Did not like this product at all. Going to toss it......;negative
Really bad, not even edible. Sticking with King David vegan white chocolate.;negative
Very good cookie but most of cookies were broken when received.;negative
I love oolong tea, this tastes great... however, I found the same quantity at a local store a couple weeks ago for a quarter of this price. Rip off.;negative
Bought it for my wife.  She says that it tastes like unsweetened cocoa powder.;negative
i hate goat cheese i tried it but maybe the people who commented are fancy pants food people that get paid to write reviews on this .;negative
Sour taste.  I like other caviars, but this one was a bust.;negative
I purchased a case and I have regretted it.  I made it with a garlic and herb creamy sauce.  This spaghetti, its' texture, and flavor tastes like Butchers' Twine/;negative
Just a matter of taste. and it is not mine.  Obviously others like it , so who am I?  But if you have never tried, think of 'acquired taste'  .  Maybe you can go there, maybe you can't.;negative
These seemed tasteless and too hard after cooking according to directions.  I usually Bob's Red Mill products but this was an exception.;negative
It's so much cheaper and easier to make your own coconut flour wraps. Plus you won't hafta worry about patches of mold like I received.  Gross!;negative
Vile tasting and gross texture, do NOT recommend!;negative
No taste at all, you have to use a soup stock chicken , beef to get some flavor.;negative
I love dill flavor but this do not taste good;negative
For the size and price it is a ripe off.  Found this in a larger size for half the price!  Feel price gouged on this purchase.;negative
all of them were hard and not chewable, had to throw out;negative
I was anxious to try these noodles, a good friend recommended them. But it turned out I couldn't easily digest them. I think they are worth trying though, very versatile & healthy.;negative
"It didn't taste like chocolate; it wasn't sweet but bitter; and it made things taste worse. I threw it out.";negative
"I saw these made on the TV show ""Unwrapped"", and they sounded like something I'd enjoy. Wrong. These cheese isn't sharp enough and they add way too much salt - it's all I can taste.";negative
not taste like pumpkin.  threw it out.;negative
"The salted part was too salty and overwhelmed the caramel taste.
The cost was way much higher than other venders - I meant to order the caramel and this was a mistake all the way around!";negative
Seems like a deal, tastes like a dud.;negative
The fortune cookies I ate or attempted to eat were stale.  I threw out almost the entire box of cookies.  I will not buy from this seller again.;negative
Leaves brine cloudy when fermenting vegetables;negative
THESE ARE THE WORST SWEET POTATO CHIPS! THEY TASTE OLD AND DAMP. WON'T BE BUYING THIS BRAND AGAIN. I'M GOING BACK TO TERRA CHIPS.;negative
Not good, they are chewy consistency;negative
Horrid, came out as a liquid...... PS-I followed the Knead first instructions......;negative
They were so stale I had to throw them out;negative
i hate this product.  it tastes terrible. i will not drink it and do not recommend it to anyone!;negative
Really awful. I got it because it's sugar-free, but I'll never eat all of it - upsets my stomach and tastes like chalk.;negative
Should not be taken while breastfeeding as it has a insulin product in it.  The taste is also lacking in the flavor department.;negative
There should be absolutely no good reason to add potato starch to a bag of shredded cheese. I guess I'll have to start shredding it myself.;negative
I suppose I am not a fan of this style of sauce. To much of a vinegary flavor for me. But better tasting than other ones that have had similar levels.;negative
"Received fruitcake in bag, VERYdisappointed!! Was squished!  Looks like a car drove over it!
Cynthia";negative
Strong chemical taste. I wishvthey would makev these with just sugar alchohol- sorbitol, xylotol or whatever and skip the aspartame.;negative
do not buy this, i did not get the brand that was shown, i got a random clear plastic bag of seeds from a different vendor, rubbish;negative
These were wayyyyyy too hot for me. I like wasabi peas normally, but these are so painful I can't eat them.;negative
I had bought some OliveNation caramel flavoring in the past and it was good. This hazelnut is unusable. It has a pure chemical smell and taste. There is a hint of hazelnut flavor but not much.;negative
too sweet! soy oil is bad for EVERYONE;negative
This juice was very expensive & I've purchased it other places ..THIS , was unsealed, and made me very ill !;negative
Expensive and didn't rise even though I followed the instructions exactly as printed.  I make a lot of bread this was an experiment to see if a package would be easier to make.  Certainly not cheaper.;negative
"I don't taste much mushroom flavor here.
It's like eating a flavorless item.

Perhaps it's how I used them:
In pasta sauce.

Maybe frying them in butter with other veggies will be different.

Thanks  ...  Ken";negative
does not really dissolve enough. the flavor is good.;negative
Received all smashed and broken. Not able to use or serve to anyone. .;negative
Just got this in yesterday. Haven't tried it. Mad about the expiration date. They expire in 30 days. Not cool for paying 26.00.;negative
they smelled like chemicals  -  did not use;negative
I don't know what it is, but this is some of the worst bacon I've ever tasted. Maybe because it's precooked?;negative
The cost is great but their are too many chex  cereal in them.;negative
Mix of tea, decaf, flavored and other coffee.  Not as advertised.  Should of paid attention to the reviews.  Not worth a return but would never order again.;negative
The nicest thing I can say is these all have a terrible aftertaste. Don't get me started on the bad stuff I could report.  They might have been seriously overpriced but at least they aren't refundable.;negative
These have an excellent taste but are very gooey and sticky;negative
Tastes horrible so I mixed it with another tea..;negative
not cooked enough.  way too fatty and too many hard bits of rind in the mix.  Pretty crappy product.;negative
NOTE these are 12 oz bags and many were impossible to open as they were not split.  Will not reorder;negative
Can the bottles have a thinner plastic(sarcasm);negative
"They taste like hospital cookies, won't buy these ever again.
Just my opinion,
Bill in Las Vegas
<><";negative
Came in smashed box, but vender refunded. Was not able to enjoy because sticks were crumbs and broken, best to buy local!!;negative
to me the flavors are over powered by pure sweet.  Im not saying they are not good they just are not what i was looking for.;negative
Not a fan of this coffee. Some taste like coffee that's been sitting in the carafe to long. (OLD) Others are bitter tasting. Think I stick to my Donut Shop K-Cups.;negative
They are fine if you really like chocolate flavored coffee, all other flavor were nothing to write home about.  I won't buy again.;negative
Eh... The quality of the meat is not worth the price. Didn't know about this infamous product. It's actually much cheaper in the local grocery store. It was about 10 cents per ounce.;negative
I think they got old before I received them.  Maybe the large amount does not move fast enough.;negative
way to strong of a lemon flavor my liking;negative
does not taste fresh. falls apart when cooked.;negative
Great Chips but you can buy them much cheaper in the store.;negative
I like most of the Crazy Cups flavors but this is one that just doesn't work for me.  The peppermint/chocolate just doesn't taste very good together.;negative
I am leaving one star because the description says these are keurig compatible and they are not. The mocha flavor doesnt have the outter ring needed for keurig to read the cup.;negative
Tastes nothing like mayonnaise! More like salad dressing! Gave it away.;negative
Not so impressed with this product, has a high sugar content, very little vanilla flavor.;negative
"Only buy if you want to forgo slicing up fruit to ""infuse"" your water.  That's all these are.  Not much flavor at all.";negative
Get the original BBQ flavor because this taste like vomit.;negative
These were sturdy enough to hold the contents I put in them, but I did not like the taste at all.;negative
Yes the packaging has changed and so has the flavor.  It is nasty.;negative
Chocolate tastes horrible to me but some people may like it;negative
Disappointed in the flavor and the texture. Not what I expected.;negative
I ordered this for my son at military college.  I got one for us at home.  Really more like snacks added to a kids lunch.;negative
I'm hoping to receive this soon.  I like Swiss Colony's offerings and want to get this candy out and in dishes well before Christmas.  It has been a while since I ordered it.;negative
Not hot, not spicy at all in my opinion.;negative
Taste is okay, a little stale, but the product is 60% dust and the pellets that aren't dust crumble immediately.  I was able to get a refund through Amazon's return policy.;negative
These can be found so much cheaper.  The colors re great.;negative
More cocoa and teas than coffee.  :/;negative
I get more bitter taste than chocolate, no amount can give me the flavor I want because it just gets overwhelmed by bitter stevia.;negative
Yuck! Not a good flavor. We normally buy peppermint or spearmint and wanted to give this bubblegum flavor a try. They're awful! The minty crystals did not go with the bubblegum flavor. Lose the mint.;negative
it tastes awful. I suspected it would....it's canned beef....;negative
Husband likes the flavor but he said it was very hard and dry in terms of consistency. We will not be purchasing again;negative
These are stale. I wish I could return them.;negative
Taste nothing like coconut, I don't know what was used for preserving this. It overtook the coconut taste, feels rubbery too. Kinda expensive, cant return either.;negative
Ok to use in shakes, but not that great in taste by itself.;negative
The taste didn't do anything for me;negative
good flavored nuts, but this is more than 1/2 peanuts.  Not worth the price.;negative
Meat was grinded too much.  It was like a paste rather than a chopped meat.;negative
Disappointed in Dunkin k cups. We found the coffee thin whereas we now  use Newman's Decaf KCUPS and they make a delicious cup.of coffee in the Keurig Brewer.;negative
Like others have mentioned,  these are not as pictured. What you get is 3 packs of 4 small 26g size, not the normal 40g bars.;negative
NOT AS strong as I expected. Was really bummed. Im a big Hazelnut coffee drinker. Just my thoughts tho.;negative
These arrived in one solid block. I hate to think how the supplier achieved that effect!;negative
I can only assume the product is ok, as it has a good reputation. However it does NOT ship well. The can leaked badly, and I had to request a refund.;negative
oh dear, i had forgotten what bananas can do to digestion( think baby)..oops...if you like them , have 1 a week;negative
Ordered 24 long stem roses and received 12 wilted tulips!;negative
Not sure why but this seems tosignificantly  lack the scent of cinnamon.  Very odd,  makes me wonder about it's freshness.;negative
Tasted stale.  Very heavy cracker.  Not Krispy.  I have had an Israeli brand which is marvelous;negative
Not for me... you may like it but not for me somewhat bland...sorry!!;negative
Compared to another brand I've enjoyed, I found them to be not bitter, stale-like, almost rubbery.  Quite a disappointment.;negative
While they taste good, there is no reason for Keebler to ruin their product with high-fructose corn syrup.;negative
canned goat milk isn't much like the refrigerated.  I use this for kittens and wasted 6 cans.  none of the 11 kittens would drink this.;negative
This Kraft product is no longer one of my favorites, it tastes too artificial for my taste.  I prefer real Parmesan from the deli, more flavorful and real.;negative
These goji berries are PURE S***.  Beware of the ensuing health consequences after consuming these tainted and contaminated goji Berries.;negative
Many of the tubes were damaged on arrival.;negative
I did not like the flavor of this at all.  I don't know if it was the combination of lime and black cherry or the artificial sweetener. Will not buy again.;negative
My husband and I did not like these. There is not a rich and creamy taste. We ended up using them in our smoothies because we didn't want to waste them.;negative
I love flavored coffees, but this one is just nasty.  It tastes bad while drinking it and then, as a bonus, it leaves a nasty aftertaste.  Ugh.;negative
Should not be labeled for consumption.;negative
These are not very yummy. The gummy bears are much better flavor wise.;negative
OUT of all the vegan snacks..this one is still aroiund..no onee wants to eat them;negative
Has the recipe changed or have I? It was a very loose sauce and there wasn't much taste.;negative
Worst product I have ever bought.  Hard dumplings, tasteless.  It should be taken off market.  A total ripoff..;negative
September. Small. Only slightly bigger than a horse Apple. Not ideal for cooking.;negative
Taste terrible--hardly used it threw it away;negative
I do not like this taste, it taste like something un-ripened.  I would love to get the olive oil that macaroni grill uses.  Wasted $26;negative
There was very little bacon flavor and caramel flavor. Very disappointed in the taste. The flavor left a bad after taste.;negative
Yum,  just not enough of them for the price;negative
I love vanilla beans, but, unfortunately the ones I received had mold in them. Eeeewwwwwww. Called amazon and they were great and offered refund. Such a shame! Beware if you order these...check them out well.;negative
Taste strange. Not the kinda tom yum soup in thai restaurants.;negative
should be fresh, which mine evidently wasn't.;negative
"Product is bad. No refund avaiible so what to do with a stale bag of camdy?
'";negative
Taste like your drinking muddy water, they say that its earthy with vanilla after taste. True muddy water with vanilla. Good laxative.;negative
It tastes so bad like it got a soap smell and taste. I'm a big fan of turkish pistachios and i have tried other companies before and i can tell which one is good and which is bad;negative
The taste was good.  I like the product but what I received was a bag of crumbs.;negative
Why would someone sell bags without twist ties?  I'm disappointed.;negative
This mayo has no resemblance to mayonnaise but is rather the consistency of salad dressing.  I think it would work far better as a dip for veggies but as mayonnaise it does nothing for me.;negative
I want to like this product so badly but the extreme fat content ruins the texture and mouth feel to the point I cannot enjoy them.  The good news is the dogs LOVE them...;negative
not as delicious as I was hoping it would be.;negative
The breakfast cookie is not to my liking and I do not think I will order them in the future!;negative
Maybe it is just me and my inexperience but I found this inedible ... so very bitter. However, this was first time I tried cacao nibs.;negative
Not worth giving up the calories for this flavor.  I will find a low calorie alternative, maybe yogurt based.;negative
This does not taste good. I don't know if it's making hot tea in a Keurig or the brand itself, but I bought these to use at our work Keurig and ended up throwing them out.;negative
I have drank alot of coffee in my day nd I found this very disappointing and funny tasting. Alot like mud. Sorry. It is coffee though so I drink it anyway.;negative
Received them stale, don't buy.............They were outdated;negative
can't be reduced to look and taste like real MASHED potatoes... never again.;negative
Sorry I like my water to taste pure without a strong after taste. Decided to go back to my filtered water.;negative
Didn't care for this it all. Was hoping for a similar taste to bw3s but nothing close. Taste like mustard.;negative
good taste, but not as sweet as other Stevia's so you need much more to get the same sweetness.;negative
Mostly flavored coffees that lack full body taste.  Look for the individual flavors that you might like and skip this assortment.;negative
Mine only had a couple of the flavors.  Was disappointed that not all 6 were there. Seemed like someone just threw a bunch on the box.  Got lots of the cheddar and the cinema.;negative
Can't eat these. A big oilyy type taste and smell and not a good taste.. This is my 3rd order and very very upset with this order.;negative
Not happy with the variety. Perhaps I am just too picky. Tastes okay.;negative
ITEM  IS  BLAND  WITH  LITTLE FLAVOR.  AND  THE  COST  IS  EXTREMELY  EXCESSIVE.  PREFER  OTHER  'NATURAL'  NUT BUTTERS  AND  THIS IS  FROM  A  NUT BUTTER  PERFECTIONIST.;negative
This tastes fine but uses hydrogenated oil in it which is the Worst and Most Unhealthy kind of fat.;negative
I've had a couple, they keep dying on me;negative
just like chewing on an old shoe! Not much flavor;negative
I like several of Dr. McDougall's items, but not this one. Don't waste your money. Try one of his other soups instead, like the split pea or minestrone.;negative
way to sweet..taste like hot sugar water..has no coffee back ground taste..sorry that i bought it..nothing like what you get in a coffe shop..waste of money;negative
One was open and all over the place.  Too expensive.  Next time I'll just get the jar.  They seemed to be old;negative
Incorrect quantity.  I only got one small bag.  Was supposed to receive 12 bags.;negative
The flavor of the gum is not that good and it doesn't last long at all. Disappointed;negative
Stale with no flavor. not sure how old this coffee is, no roast date on package;negative
Weird flavor, even added real Mac nuts.  Will go back to the real taro brand pancake mix;negative
I wanted to like this healthy snack, but found it to be too dry for me. It is a very good healthy snack choice, so you might want to try for yourself.;negative
Nothing but lemon heads, fire balls, and sour smarties.  Big waste of money.;negative
Advertised as Lightly Salted... more like way over salted. After eating one handful, your mouth burns from so much salt. Poor quality product and very oily and over roasted!;negative
Great product..but available for 73-cents per oz in smaller (2) 7.75 oz bottles!..why?;negative
This product was rancid.  I threw it away.  Now is generally makes good products, so it must have just been in a warehouse too long or something.;negative
Guess its just personal preference, but don't like them. Ended up giving them away and using them as dog treats.;negative
I didn't care for this flavor. It was okay but nothing special and it didn't remind me of bbq. I gave them away.;negative
Horrible. Acid and sour. My dog wouldn't touch them!;negative
Had these for a birthday they were Awful !!!;negative
these have a strange taste,  can't really put my finger on it, but even the service techs at work who live on the candy in my office, would not eat them. ended up throwing them away.;negative
If you like incredibly bitter coffee this is the one for you.;negative
not impressed.......should have known by the price...........will never purchase again!;negative
I did not find this product to be fresh. Perhaps raw isn't always tasty.;negative
like the last time the bottles leaked out in the box.;negative
This product is good I always buy it, but the price went up too much from $10 now to $ 38.99. I will not buy a pound of sugar at that price, now I will look for other options.;negative
These nibs tasted just like sawdust particles--not like the chocolate bits I was expecting. I had to trash them all!;negative
"Warning: If you are on a soy free diet this product contains soy.

""...WITH OTHER NATURAL FLAVORS (CONTAINS SOY LECITHIN)...""";negative
What they don't say is that this product contains cornmeal I threw them into the garbage;negative
It says 34% Juice that's why I ordered. But the label on the bottle says 3.5% Juice!;negative
These wraps are nasty.  First of all, they are really crumbly, so it's impossible to wrap anything without the wrap breaking apart.  They taste like eating a sheet of paper.;negative
"The product is OK, not exciting.  The price per serving makes the product prohibitive for this family's budget.

We won't purchase more.  Why two stars?  The kids like them.  My vote, one star";negative
This has no flavor whatsoever. It's just coconut oil with orange coloring.;negative
Beyond disgusting. Not sure how there is enough demand that they have not discontined this horrendus Frittata line;negative
didnt like these cookies at all. The cookie was too crunchy and the creme was too mushy and didn't taste good. And they were too expensive.;negative
"I know this is ""healthy request,"" but dude, it's so bland.";negative
I'm in Afghanistan and the food here is not very good but this... Man this is aweful. I gave it away after my first one. Looks great in the picture but doesn't taste like it.;negative
"Although I do like Emerils coffee, I was disappointed that the contents of the boxes that were stamped ""vanilla bean bam"" on the outside were actually just regular Emeril's coffee k-cups.";negative
Not the worst low car chocolate I've ever had, but close.;negative
Too much for me - thick, gooey and too heavy. Good, desireable flavors with tasty sausage pieces, but I didn't like the thick, gooey texture.;negative
I thought this was the regular pkg. total wt is 3.125 oz or 90 grams each pk has .625 oz or 18 grams. Won't buy again.;negative
you have to put so much in to get a decent flavor;negative
I don't like it.  I can barely use anything else with this because the salt and peppery tastes are so strong.;negative
I was so happy to find these, thinking they would taste like the ones I buy when Im in Sweden.  They dont.  I cant even taste the asparagus... I won't be getting these again.;negative
All but 3 cans were dented.  The soup was dreadful.  The broth tasted like used dishwater.  No seasoning to speak of to compensate for the absence of salt.  Tasteless vegetables.;negative
Stale.  I've had generic brand coffee that tasted better than this.;negative
More pretzel that anything. Don't count on more than a whiff of chocolate. Tiny bags. Generally, I was very displeased.;negative
Stevia sweetner, but not chocolate flavor!!! Would not buy it again!;negative
I personally didn't care for the taste but that maybe just me.;negative
While I like this we found one pkg mouldy. Disappointing as it is not marked refrigerate.;negative
Taste terrible.....gave them to my Mormon neighbors they will eat anything!!!!;negative
"It worked. Taste isn't bad.
However, I found the same product on i-herb at $ 4.82 for a box.
Should've checked i-herb first.";negative
As others here point out this is NOT the chi chi's that cooks illustrated liked. It's some cheap imitation;negative
I LOVE OATMEAL AND RAISEN COOKIES AND THESE ARE FAR FROM BEING MY FAVORITE. FOR ME THEY ARE TO DRY AND THEY CRUMBLE A LOT PLUS NOT MANY RAISENS IN THEM.;negative
not good sugar free life savers taste bad;negative
Never got used to the flavor.  Tossed it in the trash.  I rather have a tbl of maple syrup than 1/4 cup of this stuff.;negative
Not a great flavor, there are better products out there.;negative
not so great, mostly not even organic. waste of money, it was about 2 buck worth of stuff.;negative
Didn't like the texture on the noodle and the sauce is very salty. Won't order it again.;negative
Bitter and oily, clogged my grinder.;negative
Definitely syrup, this lovely bottle is too big for my taste..  Very sweet, but I have yet to find a  practical  use for it, other than to look  nice!;negative
The first bowl of this had gone bad.  If the other bowls are better, I'll update and let you know.;negative
These are gross. Weird slimy/crunchy texture mix, and minimal (and not good) flavor. Blech.;negative
Disappointed.  While it contains a lot of fruit it didn't 'sparkle' like I expected, rather bland.;negative
My son couldn't get past the first bite...neither could his dog. He says all of them are too salty but this one had a very strong taste of whatever chemicals they use to duplicate the taste of peppers.;negative
These are piece of s***, Do not buy these.;negative
gotta be better products of this type;negative
i bake frozen fries and these are the worst i can remember haveing;negative
I personally do not want propylene glycol in my food.;negative
It smells like soap and more than a few are bruised;negative
"The flavors in this soup are overpowered by the outrageously high sodium content.  This is not a meal; by far it is not a meal.  This is a snack, and a snack need not pack 24% of your daily sodium intake.";negative
Kids are not able to relish mint taste;negative
Free sample...tasted ok...not crazy about artificial sweetener. I don't chew not a gum fan so its a stretch for me to say its ok. Very sweet. Feels like chicklets used to.;negative
"I didn't like the white popcorn. This is so small, not crunch.
I prefer the yellow one for sure.";negative
This is an very inferior matcha.  You can tell by the very dull green color.  More brown than green.  Do not be fooled by all the positive reviews.;negative
I have yet to find a gluten bread that doesnt taste like a sponge wrung out.;negative
Its ok tea, but I usually get moroccan mint and the 'mint' is spearmint and in this case it's peppermint. The leaves are also chopped.;negative
So so  Not as good as other GF items I've tried but I gave it 2 stars cuz it wasn't worth the cost;negative
Tried this coffee and it tastes like ass.;negative
It has garlic and onions in it which is not personally ideal for me for a breakfast smoothie or my stomach.;negative
This is clearly green tea. Its not bad green tea, but its not white tea. I think you can only find pure white tea made by sinless Tibetan monks. Everything else is probably a mix with green tea.;negative
If you're looking for again with xylitol I would recommend the fresh cinnamon flavor;negative
I only buy food products that are made in America where there is some semblance of quality control.  I have horses and they like these well enough but be aware where this product is manufactured.;negative
The strawberries look old -- not moldy but kind of shriveled. I may be able to cut off some of the bad parts, but I think most of it will be unusable.;negative
Almost like someone crumbled a granola bar.;negative
These do not taste anything like Girl Scout cookies. I was extremely disappointed. You do not taste coconut at all. They were extremely hard. I do not recommend and I will not repurchase;negative
Product OK but delivery is very slow;negative
Bought this stuff for my husband. He told me never to buy it again. He said it was very tough.;negative
If you like sweet and sugar this is for you not for me. Which they made this same flavor with out any sugar that means no fake sugars either.;negative
My husband still eats these at times and it punishes the air quality.  These soy bars seem to stall our weight loss and I avoid soy now anyway.;negative
This stuff is not sweet. I needed to use 3x as much as the NOW brand!;negative
This flavor was not good at all. I like most of Crazy Cup brand flavors this one was almost as bad as the Banana Foster one.;negative
Oberto's flavor and texture has changed a lot, not my favorite brand anymore... :(;negative
Really doesn't have much flavor. I reduced the cup size to medium and it still tastes like hot water.  Very disappointed.  I rated other French Roast coffees with five stars.  I am not hard to please.;negative
Didn't like it , had harsh flavor, just threw it out after using 2pods;negative
Leaked all over the box and every thing else.;negative
I'm afraid to try these mushrooms-apparently shitake shrooms grow in China!? thought they came from japan.  I don't trust stuff from china;negative
The taste is fine but I've had better and it is very difficult to mix which frustrates me.;negative
Extremely overpowering orange scent.  Didn't even try to brew it!;negative
I have never had coffee as bad as this. If you like bitter flavorless coffee maybe this is for you. I am very disappointed and would not buy it again at any price.;negative
My dog hated this, so if you have a picky dog don't buy this.;negative
These are dry..and hollow...maybe ok for adults who know they have to have gluten free and try to enjoy them, but kids aren't buying it.  sorry...;negative
The sage taste is weird with tea. Made me feel sick.;negative
"It's not the seller's fault, I just assumed that these would work with my
IKeurig, but I was wrong. Apparently it's for a Keurig RIVO, which I do
not have and have never heard of.";negative
Product says it is solid at room temperature, it is not.  It is a complete liquid and it is too hard to use if refrigerated.;negative
This product tastes like olives. I usually love La Croix but I will not be buying this flavor again.;negative
Super oily...so much so that two tablespoons each day caused me to break out and get oily hair. Expensive, and some of the varieties use artificial sweetener, and too much of it.;negative
THIS STUFF AIN'T WICKED!!! IT IS DOWNRIGHT EVIL!!! AND SPICY AS HELL AND NOT VERY GOOD TASTING;negative
"I have purchased these in the past and there were Black Ones in the bag....this time no black!!
Very disappointed.  Next time I hope this is remedied - if not I'll be more careful where they are sent from.";negative
I used to really like Nutivia virgin unrefined coconut oil in the past, but for some reason I do not enjoy anymore. I do not know if the product changed. I do find Kirkland's coconut oil my favorite now.;negative
Smaller than what I thought they would be.;negative
The discs do not work with my machine. The older discs do so don't know where the problem is.;negative
Tastes badly, like it expired or something;negative
I'm giving this a 1 star simply because I purchased this item, was charged the full amount, and only received one of the four canisters I was charged.for.;negative
As most people have said, so-so flavor which does not last long at all!  Waste of money spent, but I had to try it.;negative
Didn't like this flavor as much as I was hoping I would. Best flavors are Peanut Butter Cream and Salted Caramel.;negative
"Consistency and texture were OK, but there was a distinct ""funk"" in the flavor.  Subtle, but off-putting enough where I threw most of it away.";negative
Expensive for what it is. Slightly stale not aromatic;negative
not the same as the Mocha they sell over the counter :-(;negative
Pickled bean dip is more like it.  This dip has a weird, tart taste to it that disqualifies it in my opinion.  I tried a small amount and immediately threw the rest out.  I guess it's an acquired taste.;negative
The artificial sugar flavor is too overpowering to eat.  The texture wasn't very good either.  I ate the first packet and threw away the rest.  That from a person who hates waste.;negative
It's a weak tea even when steeped for 10 minutes.  It tastes good, but is terrible for my GERD.  Cannot use it.;negative
If you like watered down soup, you'll like this.;negative
It was overpriced and low-quality some of the food tasted bad. I really would like a refund.;negative
I did not like this protein powder.  I does not taste good and is chalky.;negative
This is about as flavorless as any jerky of any kind that we have ever eaten. Fortunately the dogs are not as picky so it won't go to waste.;negative
Can't taste the caramel &the apple flavor is too sharp. In Mi we have apple farms everywhere with cider. This isn't worth the money.;negative
I like these but the price is out of line. I can buy these locally for less than $1.00 a cup. This had made me more concerned about the prices at Amazon.;negative
Not much to do with coffee as I know it except for being basically brown and hot. I like the packaging however.;negative
Not as bad as the chocolate but still has an after taste. Threw it away along with the chocolate cream. Not recommended;negative
Not a fan. These have a strange texture.;negative
it was ENGLISH tea - i expected it to be made in UK - the decaf was 3 bags to every pot - terrible;negative
Taste is not on par with American, Canadian or European Brands. Over cooked, and From China! What poison is in these little babies God only knows.;negative
"This granola was lumped together in package; had to be beaten with a knife handle to re-shape. While product was within stated exp. date it was solid; rock hard. Stale I presume. Will not repeat purchase.";negative
Kind of bland.  I prefer Candy Creek because they really taste like fruit.;negative
Terrible! Like they had grated ginger in them. I could not finish one bite.;negative
Very dry and hard to eat.  I wouldn't buy these again.  I only ate one out of the bag.  very disappointed;negative
We bought this as an alternative to wow butter. It seems grainier. My son does not particularly like it. Going back to wow butter for us.;negative
I have to pass on this, it was pretty grainy and I can tell it was definitely artificial. Just not for me. I'm better off either eating a sweet that has sugar in it or avoiding it altogether.;negative
These tasted rancid. I had to throw them away.;negative
"The 'diet"" taste comes through fairly strong. I don't believe I'll buy again.";negative
Every piece shattered! Don't buy these!;negative
I love the product and have ordered it a number of times.  However, the last time I got them, I was very disappointed as every single one of them was broken into several pieces.;negative
This was not all natural tasting at all. Others may like it but I've had much better Lime flavorings and syrup;negative
A lot of water is added to this product;negative
These were the smallest Slim Jims I have ever seen! Will not be re-ordering.;negative
they claim to be sweet...NOT...taste funny...almost milky...wont be getting these again...;negative
tastes and looks like cardboard. sorry.  I ate it, but I had to mix it with something else so I could palate it.;negative
I personally loved them, and my toddler liked them in spurts. However, my price just went from $17 to $31. No thanks! Review just went from five stars to two.;negative
product came all crumble up. very disappointed of what i received.;negative
"no coffee flavor
very poor quality cappuchino
i like all the other kcups from amazon
but this is a real looser";negative
This product uses stevia as a sweetener.  I would love it if I could tolerate the stevia taste.  Be forewarned if you are not a stevia fan.;negative
After a few days in my fridge they started to ferment. Don't buy fresh fruit from amazon unless you're eating it that same day.;negative
All of the other flavors in this rub are overpowered by the salt.  I nearly ruined a smoked brisket the only time I used this & threw the rest of it away.  I'll stick to making my own rubs.;negative
Strangest hamburger meat . The consistency was really thick .. Seemed like hamburger meat & pink paste  McDonald's uses in there products . I would not buy again .. I'm giving it to my dog .;negative
The smell of chemical preservatives came out when I cooked them in hot water. Besides the seeds inside the dates are too big.;negative
O. M. G  Covered in white mold....  When I received it..... Nothing further needs to be said.. I THOUGHT IT was a vanilla topping...... Discusting;negative
Does not taste like chocolate at all. Not even a hint of chocolate. Not a fan of the taste.;negative
These were really bad  and tasted like chemicals;negative
Well...the only thing I didn't like about it is the strong worchester taste.  I love worchester sauce but this was really strong.;negative
Here's what's right.. Smooth...silky. Here's what's wrong..WAY too sweet...nary an Almond in sight, barely a Cranberry... Absolutely NOT what I expected. Hurrah...not eating this...no can! ories.;negative
I bought it because i saw if on Doctor Oz, but I learned not to buy anything I see on his show. It tastes like candy a bit spicy but I am not sure how healthy it is it's made with high fructose corn syrup .;negative
These taste like stale imitations compared to the Mauna Loa.  I bought these because the others weren't in stock.  Don't waste your money.;negative
This was a disappointment for sure. The taste was more like chemicals than ginger and lemon.  Sorry, Stash, I usually like your products.;negative
"On the back of the bag, on the bottom, it says, ""WARNING: This product contains a chemical known to the state of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm.""";negative
It arrived on time. My husband wanted them. Now he doesn't like them. will not order again.;negative
Not anything like what I remembered about Kona coffee that I drank in a restaurant in California.;negative
These bars are sold in the US but this particular product is packaged for another market other than the US.  The labeling is not in English and the nutritional table is not for the US market.;negative
Has a funky taste...never really used it due to that.;negative
bag came opened. got like 3 packs in there. not really great for the price. and i let my kid eat a pack out of it and he loves every fruit snack.. but these he did not like at all. he wouldnt eat them;negative
Awful. It's highly carbonated and acidic, causing stomach burns.;negative
The pierogi fall apart and dissolve in the boiling water and the cheese and potato filling  becomes soupy.  What a mess!!;negative
I have bought these at the grocery store and my kids and I love them. So I was excited when I found the single size bags for my kids school lunches. Unfortunately, they were so salty no one could eat them!;negative
This coffee is too weak for my taste. I like a strong coffee without bitter aftertaste because I drink my coffee black and no sugar.;negative
Taste artificially Flavored.  YUCK!;negative
"2 of the cups were empty. Not a lot of froth. Will not buy again.
Hopefully it was just a bad box";negative
Very heavy on the garlic and it really overpowered the chip.  The sea salt version is excellent, but I ended up throwing these in the trash.  Not good at all.;negative
Terrible  Very odd taste.  can't even use it.  Into the trash.;negative
Tiny popcorn, coated with too much waxy ingredients - gave it away to my cleaners~;negative
Barest hint of peanut butter and jelly between the crackers. Like, a millimeter smear.;negative
It came hard as a rock I had to chisel it with a knife . Maybe I just got a bad one;negative
Did not chew. Fell apart in your mouth.;negative
Preservative used, while not listed as having any adverse health effects, lends the rice a sour taste (also feels like a sour irritant);negative
It is certainly a very good tasting coffee but the cost is entirely too much per cup and I will no longer order this one at all.;negative
This german bread product does NOT taste like American rye bread. Go to your grocery store for some fresh tasting rye bread.;negative
Not worth the price.  $9.00 for one small package of cheese.  Blame myself for not paying close enough attention but entirely not worth it.;negative
I fully accept that this may be my own taste bud's fault, but to me it tastes exactly like a blend of cucumbers and sugar-free bubble gum.;negative
Bland, tasteless, and full of fillers. Doesn't even have the proper texture of pepperoni. I'd recommend Bridgeford instead.;negative
Disappointed!. No Peppermint Flavor. No Chocolate Flavor.;negative
I didn't like it because it dried up so fast and it cracked later....;negative
It's a can of nuts.  They didn't add salt or other flavoring.  That makes them bland-tasting nuts.  I don't think that makes them healthy.;negative
Overpriced and tastes no better than the cheap stuff.;negative
Stale , I still have a whole bag in the pantry :(;negative
Weak vanilla, weak coffee.... won't be ordering ths again;negative
Like previous reviews have stated, 30 different kinds is not what I got. Several where missing including: Hot Coca, Newman's Own Decaf, and several others.  I returned them.;negative
Disappointed. this tastes a little soapy, I will not buy this again.;negative
Did not taste like Mango,but like pawpaw;negative
0*. This smells and taste like petrol chemicals. Horrid. Scary to eat. I spit it back out. Nasty. Cannot be returned because it's food but amazon issued a refund because it is so horrible.;negative
I love their TRUE lemon, but this product has spices added to the lime that distract from the impact. Buy the TRUE lemon;negative
"I ordered two cases of these and I just now opened the second case and the first ""lunch"" was ruined.  The peaches had leaked and rotted all over everything.  Yuck!";negative
Tastes like crap, but it definitely has some caffiene content.;negative
REALLY REALLY DISGUSTING. Came out like rubber sugar. Thin, hard, not enough flour.;negative
Will not reorder.  Salmon was spoiled when I opened package.;negative
Not sweet. Takes like 1/4 bag to sweeten.;negative
Not crazy about many of the low carb  substitutes. I still have this. I used it once and no one like it so I'm debating whether I should just throw it away.;negative
Tastes like dirty dish water. not a very strong cup of tea at all.;negative
Not one of my flavors... too fruity then with the added mint - my tastebuds said NO WAY... and so did my tummy!;negative
These were not good.  I usually buy trader Joes decided to give these a try and I will be back to trader joes.;negative
Didn't have the fresh flavor that some other Douwe Egberts ground coffee that I have had in the past. It was within the freshness date but didn't meet my expectations.;negative
"These banana chips are not just ""unsweetened.""  They are so bland and flavorless that I wonder if they are made from plantains, or maybe green, unripe bananas?";negative
Gave it away. Nice scent but 1 sip made me nauseous.;negative
8 out of the two bags were rotten. Two were so bad that the juice leaked all over. See the photos. This was not the first time that bad apples were delivered to me.;negative
tasted awful nothing like this product usally tastes. don't buy it;negative
Review title says it all really. It's not like these are certified FairTrade or anything. I suspect that Sunfood get these nuts very cheap and sell them on to us with a massive hike in price.;negative
"this is a 2.5 out of 5 star coffee.  certainly not even close to a $10 per lb. coffee.
Very weak flavor, maybe lacking the actual ""coffee"" flavor all together.
Would not buy again.";negative
Not really my kind of snack even though I love mixes like this, the flavors of these taste a bit off to me. Also, I thought the price was high for what you get.;negative
I prefer the regular or low-fat versions over this one.;negative
I love this brand and most of the other flavors they offer. But this one has a burn to it. Too much ginger for me. But I will definitely keep buying the other flavors.;negative
Just outright awful. All you get is tea dust that scratches your throat when you drink it. Very poor quality.;negative
They are too hard and the taste it is o.k., but not that great.;negative
cloyingly sweet.  no wonder they were so inexpensive...they should pay you to get them off their hands!  the only thing these corn syrup bombs have going for them is they're soft.  that's it.  ugh.;negative
I love Pure Leaf products but I didn't like the flavor of this tea at all.;negative
Product exploded everywhere! Disgusting mess that smelled like fermented/rotted cheese! Horrendous WASTE OF MONEY!;negative
This was a great disappointment. The granola was expired. I ordered them for the field.  Sadly  when they finally arrived it was to late to send them back. Expired and the taste was its match.;negative
Bars were melted and they stuck to the wrapper. I'm keeping them because I figure it's not harmful but will not buy again.;negative
I like food that is natural not something that is to fool people if I want soy taste I will grab a soy bean stalk and chew in that;negative
Just kind of anhhh.  Not horrible, but certainly not a good coleslaw taste or texture for dressing.;negative
I drank it on two separate occasions, and both times my baby had colics, crying for hours. She never had colics before so i don't think it was a coincidence.;negative
Neither my husband or myself could taste any honey in the tea. I will not buy again.;negative
Caused digestive problems.  Yuk!!!!!!!;negative
These would've been awesome had they been salted, unsalted Nori is simply inedible;negative
My husband and I both tried this and neither one of us liked it.  We tried it hot and cold and could not drink it.;negative
I learned that much of the ingredients in this product come from China.  I requested a return, they said throw it out which I did.;negative
Too smelly. Smellier than other flakes I've had. Chips are also too big. OK if you like the strong smell.;negative
Not product fault that I disliked intently and tossed them on second bite.  So much money in garbage.  First product that I simply could not eat.;negative
I was taken on the cost of this.  MUCH cheaper in the store.  But, it is a good product. However, I will not buy it again for the price.;negative
The sauce is watery, bad taste, destroyed the pizza. The dough itself was ruined and had to be thrown away after cooking.;negative
These have some kind of coating on them that just doesn't add anything.  I like the version of Planters that we buy in the store - they're bigger, smoother, and don't have the weird rough coating.;negative
so much dried not delicious I waste & TIME.NO TASTY;negative
so small and not that good.  won't order again;negative
High fructos corn syrup and partially hydronated cottonseed oil. After finally reading the ingredients, I threw them away!;negative
It's a great bold coffee BUT the cups do NOT work in the Kureig 2.0!!! I had to trade these with a neighbor.;negative
They went cheap and added more glycerin.  Barely smells like vanilla now, and is gloppy.  I don't recommend it any more.;negative
Best one canned is Taste Nirvana. This one has a canny taste to me...;negative
I'm pre-diabetic... too much sugar. Now I know.;negative
This taffy not only tasted stale but it also had a chemical taste as well.  I will not buy it again.;negative
I like Payday bars, but the ones I received on this order taste extremely stale. They still have 5 months before the expiration date on the package, but nevertheless taste stale.  I am really disappointed.;negative
The hard shell makes it too hard to eat;negative
This product is supposed to be organic fruit snacks, but they have a fake taste.;negative
These are fine in small doses. If I eat too many my teeth start to hurt from all of the sugar.;negative
Ok - but nooodles are better.  These have a fishy stink to them.;negative
Tea quality was normally Rishi, but I did not prefer the sweet taste.;negative
I love dried cherries and I often eat a lot in one sitting.  I find these cherries too sweet to eat on its own. I will use them in my granola, oatmeal or muffin recipe.  I probably won't buy this brand again.;negative
didn't really like this coffee, a little dry and no a lot of taste.;negative
it came in all Mangled up inside, ...disappointed.;negative
The flavor was not that great, its bitter.;negative
Not so tasty, super dense with scratchy texture;negative
Very small amount for the price and not very pumpkin tasting.;negative
Disappointed in this product.  Grainy crust is most of the weight.  Filling is just so-so. Going back to Nature Valley Yogurt bars, MUCH better.;negative
Extremely hard, broke a tooth. I tried grinding  into powder with coffee grinder, they broke grinder.  awful I cant believe amazon is selling theses;negative
Disappointing, sweet cardboard with coconut taste. Gave them away;negative
I received a package of gum instead of the taffy....are you kidding me.  Now I have to pay to return and wait again for the right product;negative
these avocados were more than ready to eat, they were spoiled/rotten.;negative
The beans were very dry no odor from beans even when ground coffee has no quality or personality will not order again;negative
"I enjoy these cookies when I get them at the store but the ones I received from here came in a squished and opened box with the flaps folded in and the cookies were actually crumbs.
I threw them away.";negative
Did not work, takes 6 mo to find that out;negative
"Very tiny amount this time...mostly
Almonds and tiny sunflower nuts not
Substantial really a waste of time...I was sorry to be stuck with so many pkgs
Of them...";negative
Horrible... Poor quality. Candies are very artificial and super hard! I bet manufacturer wouldn't give these candies to his own child!!!!. Came broken. Very dissapointed!;negative
I received these this week and found that they are way smaller that what I normally buy and two other stores for a similar price. I will just stick with the other two stores from now on.;negative
I'm a big Coca-Cola fan and I like Pepsi too.  I did not like the taste of this.  I barely drank one can and I dumped the rest out.  It just tastes weird.  If you really like Coke, you won't like 1893.;negative
"Flavor was not good ""to me"" and the texture was not pleasing either. Actually ate 3 pcs and tossed the rest away, but maybe it's just me";negative
Packed with OBVIOUS love by a small company.  However these NATURAL flavors are so mild, you need 1/2 a bottle to get the flavor STRONG enough. And that can put off your liquid ratio in the recipe.;negative
I thought that I was ordering a pavk.pf 12, not 6, for this price. It's too expensive and doesn't taste like coconut. Very disappointed.;negative
There is no taste to this Coffee and the price for this is much too high;negative
"What's with the 5 stars?
Mine tasty abnormaly chewy
Like it wasn't done
And the taste is awful original is the best!";negative
bottle broke. Will just have to make the trek to costco;negative
Way too expensive!! The taste was fine but I thought it was much more for the $ I paid !!! Very disappointed ! Also I saw no brachs label (?);negative
Candy was melted into a solid block upon receiving it.  Had to send it back.;negative
Was not a fan of this coffee, something just tasted off about this one.;negative
Have tried these before, BUT these were awful and do not recommend them! Try another gatherer or maybe mission figs.;negative
Absolutely NO taste! Wish I could return.... doesnt even smell like cinnamon;negative
Not my favorite. Mostly flavorless and very hard. The cherries are too big to eat whole. Would not purchase again.;negative
I've had better flavor and quality from other brands;negative
Pretty gross. Tasted too sweet with a cardboard crust. I'd rather eat nothing at all than eat this ever again.;negative
Milk is about to expire. Very disappointed. Will definitely return it.;negative
Could eat a few times but not even close to the real thing!;negative
There are not 2 pounds of snacks in this box, there are only 25 ounces...a complete lack of honesty! I have asked Amazon for a refund based on the correct weight received.;negative
I used it for iced tea, and neither the strawberry or the lychee came through very much. Meh... not impressed.;negative
Sadly there was no coconut flavor at all.  Folgers has some hits and some BIG misses on their flavored coffee.  Sadly this is a miss!;negative
I sent this to my folks for Xmas. They called and said the meat was bad and the crackers were all stale and crumbling. They threw it away before I could get with Amazon and make it right.;negative
It's a pretty low quality tea. I'd say the only thing it has going for it is that it's easy to brew without messing up.;negative
Bland, almost tasteless, and becomes soggy almost immediately after adding milk. My shipment arrived with one bad partially crushed into dust.;negative
EW Yuck!  Nasty tasting stuff.  Threw it away.  I have no complaints about the company, shipping or the quality of the product, this is just not my cup of tea I guess.  Yuck again.;negative
Really not that tasty, they were not appreciated by the kids and there are better products out there.  I threw them out eventually.;negative
The popcorn is chewy.  Better buying off individual packages rather than in bulk.;negative
Very small so very expensive and unfortunate because I need more!;negative
I like this company but this product just wasn't good.  I actually fed the remaining boxes to my cats and they didn't care for it either.  Try their peanut butter cookies, great.;negative
Weird oily taste when ate one. I guess from all the korean dramas i wanted to try this but its just not filling for me as a snack.;negative
Wasn't clear this was in a plastic jar.  Why sell raw honey in plastic?;negative
6 months after expiration date, this product has been delivered;negative
I was wanting it to be as good as teavana. It was not.;negative
but several bottles exploded and broke when I removed them from the case.  I would not order this in cold area... But I do love the taste go get your local food supplier to carry them;negative
It sometimes brews ok, sometimes weak, haven't had this issue with other coffee pods of the same type, so I don't think it's the machine:(;negative
Taste is quite artificial and very sweet with an unpleasant smoky aftertaste. Has nothing to do with real ginger beer although the aftertaste is slightly zesty. Will never buy that stuff again!!!!;negative
I wrote 2 times to the seller bobs red mill almond meal/flour was leaking at the top just like the tapioka flour. i will not buy this again. the fedx box was not damaged. thank you  alice joyce paddock;negative
Not fruit.  It is fruit flavored candy from Thailand.  Mispackaged.  Contains no vitamin c.;negative
These might be OK for hi-protein pretzels but they are not so good as pretzels, period. In addition, the bags I received will expire in less than 3 months. I am not pleased.;negative
Slow in getting to my door. Not so fresh.;negative
Three of the pumps were broke will not open. Will request a refund.  I think i just got defective pumps.;negative
NOT Licorice, some kind of junk fruit-like flavor. Sticks are hard to chew and tasteless. Waste of money. I would not recommend to to someone who I did not like.;negative
What you get is not what you see. The olives have no pimentos and rather large pits although the olives themselves are tasty. Too bad this wasn't clear in the Ad and too bad the correct photo wasn't used.;negative
I was greatly disappointed in this stuff. They call it cookies but it hard little chips that are tasteless. Save your money and buy something else.;negative
Nothing wrong with product, just not at all what I thought, that's why trial sizes are so nice, my mistakes aren't costly.;negative
Very surprised...after all the good reviews I was disappointed to find that the chocolate was very old. The centers fell out in a chunk. Extremely disappointing for $19 for 4 stale truffles.;negative
Too hard to eat.  I chipped a filling.  I discarded  the order.;negative
Gross taste does not taste like Dr pepper at all tastes like bubble gum;negative
It tastes like sugar and water with some nasty extra flavoring.  This was a very expensive purchase that went straight into the trash!;negative
Look at ingredients before buying.  I threw away because the third ingredient is MSG and the product could not be exchanged.;negative
I got these for my dad for his bday. He said they were ok.  Said it tasted like coffee grounds or something. He said they weren't that good.;negative
I actually wasn't real happy with my purchase. The price was good, but the coffee just didn't cut it. I probably won't buy this brand again;negative
"The contents are mostly water, very little chicken (rip off).  The chicken tastes good, but not great.
I would not recommend it to anyone due to the price and small amount of meat contained in the cans.";negative
My son & I both have been experiencing leakage of the grounds from the timothy's K-cup into the brewed coffee. Eww!  Coffee this expensive should not have this problem.;negative
These are nothing lime Ritz. My daughter won't eat them.;negative
Coffee has to be made extra strong (using more product) and paired with better creamer to get a good flavor - flavor is weak for this product;negative
Tastes like black tea.  Very little spice;negative
the cakes had green posts on them.  the expiration date on the box was 9/17/2013 and it was received 10/01/2013;negative
Too much money!  I can get organic bananas at Wal-Mart for almost nothing.;negative
i ordered this for christmas a few months ago and was very disappointing it tasted horrible i just threw it away waste of money :(;negative
Butter you say? This is hard as a rock.;negative
Cookie crumbles when you bite it.  Flavor is off and dry.  Reminds me of expensive dog biscuits.  Threw them out...what a waste of money.;negative
Ugh, ugh.  Sooo much sugar and no flavor.  Pineapple where?;negative
Taste like sugar water, not enough chocolate flavor, not creamy, and over sweet!;negative
Even with honey or stevia, this stuff still tastes very bland.  I won't be buying it again.;negative
I didn't read the level of sugar.  I don't really like it fixed naturally;negative
I had only one bar -- it was so hard (harder than peanut brittle!) that I was afraid I'd break a tooth.;negative
the turmeric roots were very dry and some were moldy...so had to throw some (almist half) out;negative
"Ugh, tastes awful.  I guess I was sold on the nice packaging.  I'm probably not at the point of appreciating any potential ""health"" benefits of product like that.";negative
I bought these because I am diabetic. Don't eat too many at one time, or you'll be up all night in the bathroom!!!;negative
I usually love green tea, but this tea was far too bitter for me. I've tried brewing it multiple different ways, even cold brewing, and it's always too bitter. I would not buy this again.;negative
wow...diarrhea  bad !! great flavor...but terrible on my system!;negative
I've never seen any effect on my skin as reported. It is, however, tasty.;negative
although the carton looked intact and all the boxes of crackers showed no damage or mashing every package of crackers in all 6 boxes I order are nothing but CRUMBS!!;negative
"Good but pricey.  These are what they say they are.  But way more expensive than BJ's.
Also the packets seem to be crushed a bit";negative
Not a good flavor, has a bitter taste;negative
Not best quality almonds and the sugar coasting is terrible. Next time, I will go with better quality brand names and spend more money - will be worse it.;negative
Somehow,  there is a live bug inside one of the four sealed packets of rice in the case I just got.;negative
Save your money.  Buy real coffee. We tried one after the other but they tasted worse than gas station coffee... actually, gas station coffee is probably better. It was really that bad.;negative
Very tart I really never noticed any health benefits or I never slept any better;negative
The product is very inconsistent in the package in how much. I like the sweetener, just not the packaging. It was also $5 cheaper at a retail store.;negative
Horrible! Maybe mine was rancid! Couldn't even eat it opening the bag the smell was horrible!;negative
I'm surprised this product rates so high. It's 90% canned vegetables (potatoes and beans). Certainly not worth the price. I don't recommend this product.;negative
Tasted really weird, I wouldn't buy it again.;negative
The cheese packets were cut wrong at the factory. They're cut down the middle, so the packets are empty, no cheese. We've contacted Annie's about this, and have yet to receive any return communication.;negative
SO not ready to eat.  In fact, it rotted before it ripened. Weird.;negative
not a peanut butter fan and there is just too much junk in this. 290 for 1/2 cup?  hmmm.;negative
"These ""Turkish Delight"" candies were like tasteless gummies covered with powdered sugar.  I was hoping for something closer to what I buy at a local Persian supermarket.  Not even close.";negative
The change in this product is not an upgrade. Tastes lacks salt and overall seems like a watered down version of the original;negative
Very salty and to much cayenne pepper makes it a bad tasting rub. Unfortunately no refunds for food products.;negative
"I was very disappointed in this product. It is nothing like the hulled barley I've been buying from Whole Foods.  It becomes ""mushy"" upon cooking.  I had to throw out the entire (huge) bag.";negative
Wow this stuff is pretty bad. It tastes nothing like breakfast sausage. Go with Morningstar Farms instead.;negative
the chocolate was all melted and mostly salted peanuts;negative
Taste is decent, but last shipment came with a bottle busted open and the item is unavilable for return via Amazon.;negative
"Not really my style, kind of a ""waxy"" taste.";negative
Obviously my mistake. I thought this was for 2 boxes and I believe it was an add on. For 7 bucks more than what they charge at any neighborhood store? Didn't pay close enough attention. Learn from my mistake.;negative
These are awful! They really don't have a good taste or texture & definitely don't taste anything like peanut butter.;negative
I was really disappointed by the taste of these. Not very flavourful at all, and the casing was tough.;negative
I got the white chocolate one, and I don't love it. :(  The taste was almost chalky?  My mouth felt dry eating it.  The flavor was alright, but I didn't like eating it.  I prefer other flavors.;negative
"No flavor whatsoever.  Just gummy nothingness.  Like chewing an eraser.  Blindfolded, doubt could tell one fruit from the other.

I should have stuck with my Welch's.";negative
This tea tastes disgusting... It does help you go,  but the lemon flavor is the best.;negative
Didn't like the taste and it certainly isn't the best buttercrunch toffee--my opinion.  Will definitely not order this product again!;negative
I ordered 2 lbs of yams . I received a 2 lb. football sized yam that I fed to my dogs ... it was too pithy to eat;negative
Tastes like a cross between monkey spunk and some scavengers vomit;negative
My mom won't drink anything mixed with this. Tastes odd. Now have to keep purchasing already thickened liquids. But it does thicken liquids.;negative
Agreeing with the negative reviews that there's almost no flavor in the organic version.;negative
"Cheesecake flavor i;s weak and not very sweet";negative
The product quality is good but the spray mechanism is terrible. Some times it mists, sometimes it shoots like a pinched hose...better off just getting a bottle and using a brush.;negative
Disappointing.  Tastes like egg salad to me.  I would not purchase this again.;negative
Blecchhh! Too damned sweet. Not enough crunch.;negative
This brand is usually awesome and the seeds themselves are great but this arrived with a hole in the bag. Ugh;negative
The tea tastes terrible.  It is tolerable if you seep for one minute.  Instead of zzzz's it's more like barf, barf, barf.;negative
Spry is using cheapo quality gum.  It was better when I tried it before.  Whoever said chew rubber bands instead wasn't far off.;negative
It's too complicated, supposed to boil, then bake, then something else. I can't figure out if it's pasta made from rice flour, or what?;negative
Who knew icing sugar goes stale? Exceedingly thick jacket of hardened powdered sugar surrounding a medicinal tasting nugget similar to a Cotlet without nuts. Grossest candy top 10're.;negative
sent this as gift and it was found less than expected.;negative
BAG PUNCHURED IN SQUARE  SHAPE 1 IF CHEWS HANGING OUT HOLE. CALLED AMAZON FOOD TAMPERING NOT EDIBLE. LA K OF TRUST. GARBAGE CAN;negative
Not very fond of these and, the truth is, they're not really as healthy as I thought.  Will not buy again.;negative
A disappointment.  The Vermont Country Store  has Alsorts and they are by far, much better in taste.  These are very disappointing.;negative
"These are like chewing leather.  My husband didn't like them either; they went into the trash.  I really did want to like them.";negative
I've had caper berries before and these were good if you got one that wasn't full of those hard seeds.;negative
This coffee was just okay, but much to wine-y and wangy for my taste.  Glad I stared with the small bag!;negative
Yuck! Crunchy? Yes. Tasty? Not even close.;negative
"I understand that decaf tea is not as good as regular tea, but it's still disappointing when the tea doesn't taste good.

I'm still hunting for a great decaf tea. This is not it.";negative
The Reese cups had a melted finger indentation on all of them.  Very weird.;negative
"Kinda stale. Not happy. Poor flavor.  And, Ethiopian ""Y"" is my favorite.";negative
It's really expensive at this price, I expect it to be hot, but it isn't that hot at all. Even the fresh jalapenos is hotter.;negative
Raspberries are good fresh. Someday I'll learn to accept this basic truth and stop buying processed versions. The other varieties the company agree pretty good.;negative
Does not dissolve completely leaving a large amount of sugar in your glass or pitcher;negative
Price was OK, and sounded good from Japan, but did not like the taste - on the bitter side;negative
Too much for such a small package. Lacked flavor.;negative
I have now tried all three of these and they are pretty bad.  Not inedible, but not good.  Don't waste you money.;negative
Container size was deceiving and the flavor was not right.  Will not buy again;negative
Definitely NOT the quality they used to be!  These are awful;negative
Virtually no truffle flavor at all. I was away from home past the return date or I would have sent it back! Waste of money.;negative
did not like it, it taste old and microwavable.;negative
Arrived all melted!  Don't buy after April 15.;negative
Did not have laxative effect desired.;negative
Arrived at my house melted. Could not eat.;negative
Texture is sticky and a bad aftertaste,  for me. I won't be buying again.;negative
Terrible stuff.  I ordered because I like the Lakanto Monk Fruit sweetner.  But this has an awful aftertaste. Yuk and I would not order it again.  I just wasted my money for this.;negative
I tried one and could not finish it and so did my husband. The taste is terrible and I can drink almost anything.;negative
Love the juice.  Hate the $21 shipping charge.  INSANE.;negative
"lots OF PEANUTS... TOO MANY... this is 80 to 90 %Peanuts with a ""few"" mixed nuts added in. and very salty";negative
Very bitter after taste when used in my French press.;negative
I didn't care for the taste of this at all.;negative
These upset my stomach but I gave them away and that person loved them;negative
Everyone I had try these agreed you should not eat the shells, it was gross.  The peanuts inside were like any ordinary peanut.;negative
has corn syrup, glucose and alcohol;negative
I DID NOT LIKE the taste and texture of this stuff. I bought a whole case and instant regret.;negative
Gross, nothing more I can say. I guess no longer find velveeta cheese tasty;negative
This was a bad blend, bad coffee. I had heard so mcuh about this coffee and brand but when i tried it, it had absolutley no flavor whatsoever, even after adding a third or fourth scoop.;negative
Bought Ocean Prince Oysters instead of my usual order of Rolands and very disappointed. Third can and still very chewy oysters. Didn't have this problem with Rolands so I won't be buying again.;negative
Contains undocumented very hard chunks of almonds which my youngest would not eat and which an older family member found painful to chew.;negative
Tastes like potting soil and instant coffee in a K-cup. Very. very poor coffee flavor. The coffee in my breakroom at work tastes better, THAT'S how bad this is. I wouldn't order this again if it was free.;negative
Nasty stuff...no getting around it...period!;negative
"I couldn't even eat this flavor, its taste of sour lemon. My husband loved these so it just depends on your preference.
I love lemon cookies, but these just tasted bad to me.";negative
I love love love pistachios and the price was pretty decent on these but there are LOTS of rotten, or bitter pistachios.  ugh.;negative
Not very tasty at all. Sticking to the local natural food store, buy in bulk.;negative
The price was right for what was received, but I  would not order his product again. Very disappointed with the purchase and I'm sure the trick or treaters  were also.;negative
The flavor does not even resemble Key Lime. Has a very artificial taste.;negative
Boy was I very disappointed in this item it doesn't taste like strawberry at all none of the teas are any good  I tried all of them very unhappy .Now I have several boxes I do not want;negative
They may be a good product but they arrived all melted as if they sat in the sun for a long time. Very disappointed.;negative
We absolutely love the natural original pancake and waffle mix! This was not nearly as tasty. Won't get it again.;negative
"Not as good as I'd hoped. Mediocre flavor at best. If you absolutely ""must"" have this, then wait for it to go on sale as it's just not a very good blend.";negative
Just this one time, the berries arrived with mold and smelling off.;negative
I GREW UP USING MUSTARD OIL. THIS ( ALTHOUGH MADE BY FAMOUS COMPANY LIKE DABUR) ...DOES NOT HAVE EVEN HALF OF FLAVOR OR UMPH..ALMOST LIKE CANOLA OIL.;negative
The syrup was ok, but I was hoping for more from the flavor. Also, not really the salty edge I wanted.;negative
I bought this because I'm trying to cut back on gluten, not go completely gluten-free, but I didn't like the end product. The taste was unpleasant.;negative
Did not like this product. Would not buy again;negative
Totally misrepresneted, TERRIBLE, threw them out;negative
Tiny cookies. Mega sweet. 120 calories each. Didn't satisfy my calorie/taste balance. A pass for me.;negative
Arrived with the safety seal edge hanging out from the lid so I was afraid to use it.  I got a full refund;negative
old, hard as a rock, did not dissolve, gagged at first sip.;negative
Like most candy that comes from this place it is stale and I threw them out.;negative
This coffee is bitter, even when brewed light, and does not have any hazelnut flavor whatsoever.  Do not waste your money buying this product.;negative
Friends suggested I try this. Not my thing -- a bit bitter.;negative
Too sweet and I didn't notice any difference between flavors.;negative
Weak and artificial tasting. If I could have returned it, I would have sent it back.;negative
I somewhat like the Jerky, but both the delivery time and the customer service is extremely dissatisfying! Will have to rethink whether to order again!;negative
It was a horrible discovery to find that there were real bugs in this macaroni. Weevils had infested the boxes I got. So gross!;negative
First, this coffee smells like something else is in it besides hazelnut.  Not impressed and would not buy again.  Sorry.;negative
Tinny taste, did not like it at all.;negative
These were a lot dryer than I expected, and very tough. A number of pieces also had a sort of crystally coating on them, that kinda bothered me. Don't think I'll be trying this brand again.;negative
Not to my taste. Too hot and spicy.  Prefer amilder cinnamon flavor.;negative
I do not like the coffee because it has a bitter rich coffee taste.  the taste is like stale coffee reheated several days old.  ish.  sorry.;negative
"The flavor is good. They must not take out the pits; either that or they don't take it the little seed butts before grinding, because  the powder has some hard as rock  pieces in it. I'm bummed.";negative
Did not like the taste of this spice at all.. did not make the food taste well at all.. will have to try others..;negative
i ordered these in the summer, which might have been a mistake. they arrived stale and inedible. what a waste. I won't order these again.;negative
I had one, then gave the rest to homeless..;negative
lots of garbage coffee that I would never ever buy again.  But.... much cheaper than buying a whole box of a single kind of garbage coffee that wasn't drinkable.  A few good ones though.;negative
Arrived one month from expiration date. The **** am I supposed to do? Eat 2-3 a day???!!?!?;negative
This was just plain horrible.  Very sour.;negative
Cans were dented and the description was misleading.;negative
"I kept finding this item ""out of stock"" and mistakenly assumed it must be good. Green Mountain  has great coffee but this stuff really sucks!";negative
It makes perfect sense to eat this on a diet, but hard as I've tried, I just can't get passed the feeling that I'm chewing rubber bands.;negative
boys did not like the flavor at all!  Sorry;negative
Only the top layer is whole cashews.  The rest is bits and pieces.;negative
Very disappointed about the expiration date =( !!!! It expires in July of 2017. I don`t think I`ll be able to use 1lb in such a short period of time. What a bummer =(!;negative
These cups do not fit the 2.0 machine. Either does the Grove Square cappuccino.;negative
Grove Square Caramel Apple Cider, Sugar Free, 18-Count Single Serverings wasn't the quality I was looking for.  The flavor just was *****.;negative
I opened the box right away, but the bars were stale.  Ive eaten 3 packaged bars, and they were all stale.  Disappointing.;negative
Horrible aftertaste, lingered for hours, threw it out.;negative
Stale.  Sent back.  Actually, they were rancid.;negative
Did not come in Lindor box. No ingredient or nutritional info. Not the usual shiny dark chocolate. Is this bootlegged imitation lindor? Pieces had dusty surface and didn't taste like dark chocolate.;negative
This product was much dryer than I expected, and the Honey Mustard flavor was barely there for that reason.  Would not buy again.;negative
Very dissatisfied with this instant tea. Too milky & taste terrible;negative
Mine was very thin trunk - and very few foliage - big spaces - hanging to the right- which is to heavy for the main stem - disappointed!;negative
First false advertising it arrived in a box not container pictured.  I purchased for two reasons: (1) container (2) individually wrapped.;negative
We did NOT like the flavor of this coffee. It just tasted off to me. Expensive lesson learned. I threw it in the compost. Save your money.;negative
Very disappointed! All but 3 were CRUSHED! Buyer beware!;negative
Stale! Every one came crushed & broken;negative
These were not fresh at all. Never will buy again.. I'll stick to a regular store next time!;negative
One flavor for 10 suckers. Thought each one had a different flavor. The planets look nothing spectacular just a blurry backround and when you get to eat it at the end it's a gooey paper mess. Not recommended.;negative
This product seems to be expired or stored improperly. It's stale. Will break your teeth. I have had fresh ones and those were chewy. These are like rocks!;negative
The taste was very unpleasant -- it did not taste like caramel corn at all.  I cannot express my reaction as anything other than disgust at the taste.;negative
Delicious crackers  if they arrive intact which they usually do . but not broken like  in the last shipment. Have liked these crackers for years and hope they still are available on Amazon in the future.;negative
"Received with too many broken pretzels; which must be hard to avoid.  Not a good item to have shipped.
The pretzels are delicious!";negative
I gave it one star because of the small amount your getting per packet at a cost of almost $8 bucks per box.;negative
Too sickeningly sweet.  This is CONCENTRATED, although it doesn't say so.  If  you add it to a pitcher of water, it would be ok.;negative
First time tasting tart cherry juice. Did not like the taste.;negative
"Not very much flavor in the cup of tea.  It is convenient and hopefully will be fresh when used.
Thank you";negative
Absolutely disgusting. I have bought Lenny & Larry's products years before and remember them being delicious, but this brownie was God-awful. So much so, that I doubt i'll ever buy anything from them again.;negative
Apples a small and lack taste sometimes. The brand changes often so it is hit or miss. The individual apples are more expensive but worth it.;negative
Naaaaasty!  The clumps of dried broccoli never rehydrate so you get bits of something with the consistency of styrofoam in your mouth.  It's hideous.;negative
Not for us as flavour was not as good as anticipated;negative
These make me outrageously hungry due to the maple sugar;negative
Arrived broken and tasted a little stale. Cranberries were sticky.;negative
Was looking forward but box came with only 40, also all suckers were broken and box was open wouldn't buy again;negative
I would give it no stars! Has no flavor at all. Super disappointed. Had higher hopes with all the good reviews.;negative
These were horrible, taste like paper and not worth trying!  Was hoping to find a low paleo option for lunch but this is not it.;negative
Product is tasteless and has awful texture. Out of 6 boxes, not just a bad batch.;negative
The ingredients sounded good, so I tried a box.  They did not meet expectations. The bars were very hard and crunchy to the point of being difficult, and they were just too salty tasting for me.  No more.;negative
teeny seeds, poor pkg perforation. There even were seeds in the box.;negative
I realize Cappuccino is not supposed to contain much coffee and mostly milk etc.  But I prefer to at least taste a little coffee in it.  I get no coffee taste from this at all.;negative
"Neccos bring back childhood memories for me, so I was excited to find them on Amazon.

When they arrived, they were like eating flavored glass....  They were all incredibly stale.";negative
It looks like it is going bad and is not worth the effort... looks like they used melons that were about to go bad. Not fresh at all;negative
The package I received was over a year old. It expires in less than a year. Not happy. Make sure you check the expiration dates.;negative
Misread the size on this product. This is an insane price for the tiny bag I received.;negative
Way too sweet.  There is so much sugar that you can't pick-up the flavor differences between the fruit and all you get is a textural difference.;negative
Tastes really nasty. I don't drink much, but this didn't taste anything like an Appletini... it definitely tasted like chemicals!;negative
The volume of the contents is clearly shown, but for the amount of content per box I still feel like the price is far too high.;negative
Bitter at first taste then gets a little better.  Love the salted Carmels but these won't come again.;negative
I bought three different colors of candy melts and this one did not melt. It remained clumpy and thick. Needless to say it was a waste for our Easter treats!;negative
This was a hearty salad (enough for a small meal), but I'm not a fan of the flavor.  It has a very strong vinegar taste to it.;negative
This version of Stevia contains a filler product of LACTOSE, a sugar product. The ad is deceiving, as it does not show the product label, or a list of ingredients.;negative
"I love the product, but my last shipment of 3 bags was OLD. Oxidized coating on exterior of 'kisses', under the foil...
VERY DISAPPOINTED!!
WANT A REFUND!!
BLECH!";negative
Definitely not candy corn!! No honey flavor  Very sweet. Candy is very soft;negative
Cooked exactly according to directions.  Pancakes came out rubbery and blueberries are terrible.  The family all agreed.  Was looking forward to these but definitely will not purchase again.;negative
Didn't like these much, my friend who had never had normal peanut butter before (allergic) didn't like them either. They taste similar to PB but it's really weird.;negative
There is absolutely nothing wrong with this product, but I bought shiitake mushrooms from my local Asian Market for about 75% less.;negative
Thanks for the egg tip, it works very well and really helps this product.  Nevertheless, I ended up giving away three of the six containers because I was not thrilled with the nutritional information.;negative
I was hoping for a taste that was kind of like Diet Pepsi Lime, it wasn't at all.  Won't use the rest of it.;negative
No vanilla bean flavor.  This seems to be a constant complaint or perhaps the product is actually old.;negative
EXPIRED IN SEPTEMBER, DELIVERED IN OCTOBER;negative
Kinda funky flavored.  Wont order again.;negative
Nobody around here likes this favor on these prezels.;negative
How anyone can eat these I don't understand, no one in my family liked them. However the Frosted Brown Sugar Cinnamon ones are still delicious although a bit different than they used to be.;negative
My chips were open and stale! Not all of them but some!;negative
"so nasty... the taste was like having herpes.. ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
hahahah, lOL
nasty, toilet, garbage, this product should not even exist... it's so nasty.";negative
"4 cans in a paper box without bubble or popcorns...
You gotta kidding me.
Thanks for damaging 4 cans!
But i still love the taste of ambrosia.  Hummmmmm..";negative
The title pretty much says it all.  Even in a latte, the brew is so bitter, it's difficult for me to drink. I love strong coffee, but not bitter.;negative
Could  not spit it out fast enough.  Through them out.;negative
Lots of caffeine but very bitter tasting and it will eat a hole in your stomach;negative
I like that the apple were organic and tasted good. BUT, I didn't like that the apples had so many defects.;negative
Although this smells delicious I cannot eat it since it has maltodextrin.;negative
Bland...nothing about a kick....would not buy again;negative
I like Popchips very much. My favorite is the barbecue.  I tried the Tortilla chips based on my experience with the Popchips. I did not like this product at all.;negative
Not impressed... Little flavor, low smoke point.;negative
Didn't really work for me as a flour replacement for some reason.  The recipes were always off or the end product looked ok but tasted weird and gritty.;negative
More like candied papaya than dried fruit.;negative
They all taste the same, like lemon.;negative
I thought I was paying for a number of boxes, but it was the number of bags. It was almost 7$ for a box of 6 bays.  twice the usual rate.  won't buy this again;negative
I guess I only like fresh ginger, I am disguising the tast with 2 bags of green tea in my water bottle;negative
It's just heat, not THAT hot... Mostly, it just tastes terrible.;negative
contains MSG.  Not healthy for my kidneys.  Will not buy again.;negative
After all the great reviews on Amazon.com, I was disappointed with Steaz Organic Iced Teaz with Peach. I won't be ordering or promoting it.;negative
This is a good product compared to the price but  even if you don't want to continue shipping goods.;negative
Molded quickly and not as described. Had an orange inside.;negative
"Fresh, came intact. It'd be closer to call this ""heavily salted"" or ""over salted"" than ""lightly salted""...";negative
"Half the cans were okay. The other half were rancid... even though well within their expiration date.
Those we could eat were alright; not great but not terrible.
Just not a good experience.";negative
The microwave time is crazy.  I could whip something up on the stove in the same amount of time that tastes better.;negative
Nasty taste. I regret buying all 5 different flavors.;negative
Quite possibly the smallest cauliflower head I have ever bought. Smaller than the size of my fist. I don't think I had ever seen a cauliflower that small, until I got this one delivered.;negative
TOO TART! Bought to use for apple cherry pie and ended up buying fresh cherries.;negative
I bought this because it was on sale I've been using ghee for a very long time and I'm into health foods and natural products taste is Bland and a big disappointment;negative
Love Gummi Bears but this is over-priced for 5oz. And, yes hard. Definitely aged.;negative
"Again, package had been flattened; no protection.  The candy had been crushed together and melted into one big blob.  Again to trash can.";negative
Do not like the taste and gave it a dear friend who absolutely loves it.;negative
The picture is deceptive, the basket is much smaller, and does not indicate that is for one person.  I would not recommend ordering this item, nor will I order from this company again.;negative
the combination of fruit and meat is a bad idea. please make meat-only products.;negative
"Very large chunks. Not very tasty; extremely tough. Texture seems more like octopus than squid. Have tasted better quality in olive oil from Spain, bought for much less at a huge well-known supercenter.";negative
Awful. Truly awful. Bought on advice from friend. Taste is somewhere between hot sauce and ranch dressing. Heavy on hot sauce. I love sriracha but not this.;negative
It's ok.  They actually sent French Vanilla, not the flavor listed.;negative
Selling infurier tuna, cats don't even eat it. This is just mush, no chunks, just bottom of the barrel crap.;negative
Tasted terrible there was no coconut taste to it at all.;negative
these are coffees that no one liked to start with;negative
These look good but they aren't sweet at all when you chew them. Bleh.;negative
"This was worst I have ever received from Amazon
Moldy, Broke open not one with seal or juice";negative
May be I got a bad batch, but these are the most bitter tasting seeds I have ever eaten.  I had to spit some out they tasted so bad.;negative
Warning: contains CHICKEN! The label is misleading. The US National Institutes of Health has determined that allergies to poultry meat, while rare, can have severe consequences for those afflicted with it.;negative
I paid more for this product because it's organic. It doesn't smell nearly as fresh and good as Mother Earth's. The color is brown as well. I would not purchase again.;negative
"This tea has oodles of different types of mint but NO flavor. I was hugely disappointed.

I will stick to my organic single mint tea varieties I find at *arget.";negative
Didn't really care for the taste of this tea at all . I got rid of it .;negative
Candy had started to melt when arrived. Chocolate has a white film so we won't be eating it. Tossing it out. Too bad but chocolate is hard to ship.;negative
I'm so disappointed in this product! There is no scent and no flavor. The bulk product I get at Sam's Club is much better  Did I get a bad batch? I don't know but I absolutely do not recommend this;negative
It tastes weird. Not bad, but just... not good, either. I'm keeping it to cook with, but I've gone out of my way to get milk since so I don't have to drink this.;negative
Some of the nuts have rancid taste.  Will not order these again.;negative
Very disappointed stale Will not purchase again;negative
They are horrible. Not tasty, very watery, and not really sweet.;negative
This tasted old, would not buy again. Ended up throwing it out. Tasted gross.;negative
I'm sorry, I tried to like this but it just sort of tasted rank and kind of nasty.;negative
if you like sour you will enjoy these my I gave them to my friend she loved them;negative
all the pretzels are smashed to pieces.  they are pretty much useless as pretzel chips now.  it is a giant bag of crumbs.  will not buy again from this seller.;negative
Didn't like it, a little too sweet for my tastes. Lots of cinnamon. I'll dilute it by blending it with other teas.;negative
I did not enjoy these at all.  I had some that were given to me as a gift that were more soft - these were really hard and didn't taste the same as the ones I had be given, so not my favorite at all.;negative
Would have given this product more stars but the price is not so nice.  Wish it was more affordable.;negative
bag arrived ripped with product spilled all over in the box. Will not order again.;negative
"The cookies are minty; very disappointed";negative
Wow. Talk about over priced.  I looked at this wrong when I ordered it and thought it came with more than one bar.  Nope - just one candy bar.  $$$$$$$ Not worth it.;negative
This coffee has a sweetness to it that is slightly off-putting. Not having any luck finding a low acid decaf that tastes nice for evenings.;negative
Thought I should try it, I thought wrong :c;negative
Now I know. I am not a fan of microwave pork rinds.;negative
I just don't like the it...  Not a happy purchase...;negative
package was open and salt was all over box. returned;negative
I would give this a zero rating if I could! You can't even taste the sweetness in this stuff. Enough said.;negative
Without fizz this is tasteless water with a slight aroma of fruit.  I can get the same experience drinking plain bottled water and have an open can of fruit nearby.;negative
BOGUS! do not buy. this is not quality or even real saffron. I've been using saffron for 30 years. plus not eligible for return. I had to call and a lovely lady hooked me up with credit towards the real deal;negative
I bought this BBQ sauce for my husband because of the low carbs. He generally likes a honey BBQ sauce. Unfortunately, he didn't like the taste of this one.;negative
Arrived opened.  Sending back for replacement;negative
Screw on cap very loose. No external seal. Freshness seal under the cap was completely loose. Doesn't have much aroma.;negative
This comes in a SOLD block and is SO tough you have to stab at it with a SHARP knife!  THEN it comes apart like little bales of hay!  It is almost flavorless and the consistency is like STRAW!  Horrid!;negative
I was hoping that this was plain old lard.  It has chemicals in it, my guess is to make it shelf stable.;negative
Does not work in a Keurig Brewer as stated on the box. Taste is OK, but other less expensive Kona blends have a deeper favor,.;negative
tastes fishy, not a fan, I had high hopes;negative
They added sugar and food dye to the dried fruit. I thought I was just getting dried fruit instead it is more like candy. Yuck;negative
Taste is OK but gives me horrible digestive problems. I cannot use and am not unusually sensitive to most food products.;negative
RECEIVED WRONG PRODUCT BY MISTAKE. ORDERED ICED OATMEAL AND RECEIVED 9 BOXES OF FROSTED LEMON COOKIES;negative
These are not hot at all.  Don't know if that is because they could be old or what;negative
There is no indication anywhere in the package in reference to this product being non-gmo. Most likely it is GMO, I will have to discard mine or give to a junk food eater.;negative
Was disappointed in the taste that eminated from these three bottles.  Also the syrup is very hard to get out and one must exert a lot of pressure to satisfy a sunday.  Read the ingredients!;negative
They were melted and mashed together..sadly;negative
Tasted like the aluminum can it came in....had to throw them all out after trying multiple cans, refrigerating them, nothing helped;negative
Disappointed! They wouldn't let me return it for credit. Very bitter tasting. I sent it back anyway!!!!!!;negative
Four of the containers had rounded bottoms and tops {botulism ?). One container had ruptured in shipment. Campbells should pull this product off the market.;negative
No flavor at all. Will not buy again.;negative
Used to LOVE Don Pablo when I was a Costco customer.  Maybe it's just the organic blend . . . beans look beautifully shiny and rich, but the taste is WEAK.  AND, YOU CAN'T RETURN!;negative
Good price for a 1 pound bag  but it was full of tiny pieces it seems like it was all scrap that's why it was so cheap;negative
love nespresso but its way cheaper to buy the pods directly from the company.;negative
It was a good try, but they really taste terrible.  I saw that some thought they would be good for salad, but I can't even do that.  They do not suit my taste buds at all.;negative
Too much salt and NOT enough garlic... my recommendation is to buy the separately.;negative
l would not order this again because it has a bad taste i though it would be good;negative
It may just be me, but I didn't care for the taste, they seemed a bit pasty.;negative
"I was experimenting with different nuts and seeds as a ""super food"" for smoothies. This was not a good choice for me.";negative
Old and spoiled!! I want my money refunded!!;negative
DIDNT TASTE VERY GOOD WONT BUY AGAIN;negative
I've already reviewed this way back in April, but for whatever reason you didn't publish it...I found it MOST AWFUL!;negative
Not happy that many of the slap stix arrived melted in the box.;negative
Doesn't last long in the can - buy local if you can;negative
Tastes like scented candles... Very dull and waxy... Buy the normal starburst...;negative
This must be an acquired taste. Didn't care for it at all. Tasted and smelled like pencil shavings to me, though I have a friend who does enjoy it (and got my box).;negative
I would like this fruit bar if it did not contain bits of rock hard pits. I bought a dozen and two bars had gravelly pits. Bad for my dental work.;negative
I was so disappointed it didn't bloom the tea didn't even brew it tasted so bad such a waste of my money. Don't purchase this product.;negative
Way too sweet.  It's like they over compensated with sugar to trick you into forgetting they're gluten free.  Good effort but not for me.;negative
Hard to blend or mix into liquid or food.  Be sure to have plenty of floss.;negative
Don't think this stuff is good at all, it's not a low cal alternative to peanut butter - it's just something else entirely.;negative
Very strong chemical taste! In this case, I would prefer real sugar - it would be the lesser of two evils!;negative
bitter boring..was hoping for better than normal.;negative
"I like it that their beans have an expiration date, as these do Not!
Ground up dry, and tasted old.";negative
Kind of a pungent taste...like one of those fringe French cheeses that smell like sweaty feet. Crunchy but not light and airy puffs.  I tried to eat a serving but there was just too much essence of gym sock.;negative
If you cook theses to the instructions they turn out like a hockey puck. Won't buy again.;negative
They were pretty dry unlike the actual Turkish delights are supposed to be. They there just meh...;negative
All flavors tasted the same and kinda dried out (moreso than they should be, almost stale) they weren't TERRIBLE but they weren't especially good either.;negative
Loaded with dye, tossed in the trash;negative
Too dry for my taste .. I guess it's an acquired taste;negative
Terrible rice. It was soggy and tasted awful.;negative
These were low priced and about the quality of what you would find on sale at a Walmart. They were not snapping fresh and had low to mild flavor. I love pistachios but did not finish the bag.;negative
Was not happy with these. They were not crunchy or very flavorful. Also had some that were almost rancid, they were very gross. Had to throw most of the bag away. Maybe we just got a bad bag.;negative
I enjoyed these when I was a kid growing up in Canada.  I was very disappointed.  The chcoclate was stale and white in colour.  I won't buy again.;negative
This tea did nothing for me or as it compares to other detox Tea's like Zeja....going back to what I know;negative
the package had warning so I would not try it so I throw it in the garbage;negative
I was expecting a good product but this product let me down big time. It is some of the worst macaroni and cheese I have ever eaten.;negative
great taste but they hurt the lips after a while.,;negative
Not my favorite.  After a bite or 2, it becomes heavy and cloying.;negative
We ended up having to return these.... They were much smaller than we were expecting and several of them had melted in shipping.;negative
Very poor product, not any better than the stock that you can buy at walmart at half this price. Not a demi_glace.;negative
didnt even a get a chance to try it cause was shattered in to pieces in package, tried to get replacement, but haven't seen any respond in a right way;negative
The second bag was pretty much just powder. The first bag was great.;negative
nasty.  no coffee flavor. waste of money , space and gasoline delivering this junk .;negative
Not sour what so ever, taste like a sweet lemon.;negative
I don't like the fake chocolate flavor. It was worth a try. I think i'd prefer splenda and cocoa powder.;negative
Taste watered down. Not strong enough...the Rooibos flavor just ins't there.;negative
Flavor literally only last 3 seconds & then tastes awful. Waste of money.;negative
In no way a ''sour cherry''. Far too sweet, and quite ordinary.;negative
This is a very small package for the price.;negative
Very disappointed. It tastes terrible, and the only thing I can tolerate it on is Oatmeal. I don't know about the nutritional value, I can get past the terrible taste.;negative
This cappuccino is sticky sweet and artificial tasting.  I wasted money on a large box.;negative
Bought it as a gift and they didn't like it, said it was tiny.;negative
Bought as a gift for my son who only eats organic.  He was not fond of this.;negative
Chicken was very rubbery. Rice was dry. Beans were just ok.;negative
Half of the 8 arrived crushed or completely wilted and I am totally bummed out - it looks like it would have been a nice collection from what others posted but I'll never know.;negative
terrible flavor, ashy, burned and bitter.;negative
I've had matcha snacks before but this one left a really weird aftertaste in my mouth like a diet Pepsi.  I thought maybe I had a bad batch but the second box tasted the same as well.;negative
Not impressed by these at all! Far too many hulls!;negative
Nasty chemical taste that clashes with the caramel;negative
"Way too expensive.  Not clear on the size,  I thought I was getting a larger bottle.

Didn't use.  So I can't speak to the flavor.  Good customer service.";negative
When I received this package, it was crushed, open and half the bags were missing.  The remaining bags were crushed.;negative
I didn't like it. The carob tasted like sweet candy, too sweet.;negative
As the title says, tea is weak and very watery even with pulse brew activated. I will not be ordering anymore.;negative
I CANNOT BELIEVE I PAID $6.99 for a box of tea that sells for $3.95 in an upscale supermarket! I thought it must be a larger packet! WRONG!!! WOW!;negative
Probably won't re-order -- not my favorite flavor;negative
I tried two of their seasoning, yuck, yuck. won't waist my time and meat using any of their seasoning packages.;negative
All the ingredients are there... they just don't taste as good as they should... kind of mushy.  I ate it, but won't purchase again;negative
I did not like this item at all.  It didn't rise very much and the taste was awful to me. I put the other two boxes in the trash. I will not buy this product again.;negative
Tastes more like a sweet drink.  Does not taste like pumpkin.;negative
They are too dry.  The taste is bland.  I ended up throwing them away.;negative
For some reason this tea gave me really bad stomach cramps.  No idea why.  I tried it three times and had the same thing all three times.;negative
Coffee seemed like it wasn't completely ground many different colored(light brown) pieces... I reground it and most disappeared;negative
Total rip off! I could get 4 times this much chocolate if I bought it at the grocery store for full price. SUPER unhappy;negative
Not for me. Too flimsy and no taste. Texture did not work for me.;negative
Noodles cooked up well, but the broth mix tasted aweful.;negative
Based on a recommendation from a friend, I purchased this Turmeric. I shouldn't have. I won't be ordering this again.;negative
I couldn't get it down no matter what I put on it to kill the taste. It smells and tastes pretty bad. You have to be very dedicated person to use it.;negative
Not as hot as I had hoped. Powder is a better source. Disappointed, but will use.;negative
Stale. Very small kernels inside of big pods.;negative
This was the worst pizza I have ever eaten my dogs wouldn't even eat it money wasted;negative
So disappointed. They changed the recipe and now this has a nasty aftertaste. My first try was in the assorted pack and I loved this flavor. Bummer.;negative
"I've tried soo many coconut waters...since I cannot drink this---I'll have it here for company.
Sounds like a healthy drink, but,  yuck for me.";negative
cereal has no weight, like eating air;negative
Love Cake Boss but this coffee is utterly tasteless. Could be dishwater.;negative
Sunk and never frothed even I prepared as directed.;negative
Brown water, so surprising since I adore the Italian roast.;negative
It didn't taste like mayo at all, they overdid it with the weird vinegar;negative
I didn't know it was micro small...just enough for a jug...;negative
First bag I got was great--very fragrant and long grains.  Second and third bags tasted worse than Trader Joe's rice....;negative
Sweet but doesn't dissolve. I've had to strain liquids after stirring this sweetener in. Always leaves clumps.;negative
Nasty cheese. Horrible flavor and grainy, gritty texture.;negative
Flavors are like candy, with no resemblance to actual fruit flavors. Portions are longer than a foot, though. For kids primarily.;negative
Too weak & not very good tasting, when enough is added to make it taste like root beer.;negative
"The chocolate is not smooth and left a strange after taste.  I wouldn't buy it again.

This is a review for milk chocolate with cherries.";negative
I have ordered this coffee previously and it was good. This time it is terrible. I will never buy it again.;negative
Arrived frozen though no where in the product information does it indicate this would be the case.;negative
I should have ordered from Renfroe these were crusty. Not good. not worth it. cant eat them. they are no good.;negative
Tasted stale and bland. I've had this tea before and it was delicious. Will continue to purchase from grocery store I suppose. I gave this box away to a friend, very dissappointing.;negative
taste different .... will not reorder;negative
"Odd taste; not half as good as Chock Full's NY roast.";negative
HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP, what more can I say? Horrible taste! Do your body a favor, please read the labels carefully :-) I wish I had. (Be healthy, live life, live long!);negative
It came with a hole in the bag so I couldn't use it.;negative
Loved these as a kid but tried them on a whim and found them pretty tasteless.;negative
The tea smells great but I didn't feel that it was strong enough for me when I drank the tea.;negative
Did not care for these energy bars.;negative
My husband is the peanut fan and he has a thumbs down for this product. Must be a problem with US peanuts in the past couple of years, we just can not find good ones!;negative
Only a few of the teas were good. Rather just buy the one or two I enjoyed.;negative
"Way too much oil and very little ""butter"" in this product. Ironically, it smells more like pistachio than it tastes.";negative
Didn't care for this syrup.  The coffee flavor was way to subtle while the overall taste was too sweet.  Disappointing.  I hope my sink likes it better than I did.;negative
The quality is excellent, however, this came as a one lb package, not a 2 lb package as advertised. Disappointed.;negative
All but one of the six bags had a hole in them.  Not very fresh.  These were to be stocking stuffers.  Very disappointed.;negative
I love corn nuts but these are nothing like what I am used to.;negative
Price far exceeds Nespresso direct delivery options.;negative
"It has a very hard shell and mediocre taste; big disappointment.";negative
This is like seltzer water and I hate seltzer water just saying !!!!!!!!!!!! No taste.;negative
this probably would have been a good soup but there's too much added sugar...it tastes way too sweet! 24 grams of sugar per servicing. No one in my family could get past the sugary taste.;negative
I think I'll go back to the Schilling!  It's too sweet for me.;negative
GMO content artificial, haven't used much pods, going to throw away;negative
There was a slight cinnamon flavor. No sweet potato flavor at all.  Just air puffed orange sticks that were like styrofoam.  I threw them out.;negative
I was mixing up my essential oils into the container when I noticed black gunk. Mold! Thank the Lord I wasn't eating this.;negative
This popcorn had a different flavor.;negative
The product is fine but it came opened with only 11 packages of cookies instead of 12. It seems someone enjoyed and helped themselves to a pack of cookies. Sucks cuz these aren't cheap.;negative
Normally I love these crackers but the 6 pack I ordered are very stale tasting. The kids are disappointed.;negative
some was mouldy.. threw it all out.;negative
Small taste to match their small size;negative
"This was the 1st and will be the last time I will order any International Delight products. This so called ""sweet cream"" tasted and smelled like pure ""Chemicals""... NASTY";negative
super sweet not as good as savannah bee company tupelo.;negative
I like spearmint gum, but this was a bit too strong for my taste. I can't even finish the packs I bought, so wouldn't buy again. If you don't mind the strong flavor, it might be OK otherwise.;negative
expensive unhealthy crud - bad for your health - wake up;negative
These arrived rotten and covered in slimy mold!! I should have listened to the other reviews. Purchase with caution!! Would have given minus stars if possible.;negative
I love raspberrys but this mix was a bit sharp and bitter not at all i want in a raspberry syrup;negative
I don't taste vanilla or espresso, it just tastes like almond butter. Pretty disappointed and at 190 calories a pack, not great for the calorie counters out there. I wish they offered a money back guarantee;negative
I thought it had a stale, moldy taste to it.  Mold means toxins so I can't recommend it.;negative
Very bad toffee please don not buy this, it looks like you eat a whole spoon of sugar in one shot;negative
Bought it as a gift for my mother. Doesn't fit her Braun coffeemaker. Bummer. Sending it back. Oh well.;negative
Because it is gluten free, it cooks all stuck together.;negative
This isn't very good apple crisp.  It is just apples in a mildly sweet sauce with oatmeal sprinkled over it.  It is not my idea of apple crisp.  It's chewy, not crisp.;negative
These were bad. They do not taste like raspberries. The flavor was ok I suppose. I was looking for a good raspberry flavored sucker. This wasn't it.;negative
not sure about this stuff. It tastes ok hot or cold...;negative
My wife and I did not like it nor did we notice any benefits from 'normal' mushrooms.;negative
They simply were not as fresh as I expected.;negative
Weak and returned not what advertised a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!;negative
Dark Chocolate tastes awful. It leaves some dusty chemicals at the bottom that doesn't seem to get mixed with the milk. Only one good thing is there are more than what I expected for this price.;negative
The flavored tuna has a fake taste. Kcmo for Amazon's headquarters;negative
Although this item did taste okay, the real fact is one 8 ounce package is only 18 cookies.  I thought this was overpriced and not a good value.  I will not be purchasing this again.;negative
If I understood the instructions on how to properly cook this product, I would be able to test it be write. Proper review.;negative
This is the second cherry syrup I have tried from Amazon.  This brand is not good either.  Does not taste like cherry.  Bought it to make cherry cokes.  Too awful tasting to use!!!;negative
"Very mild flavor - too mild.
I am a texture person and this has a very odd one.  The jury is still out on whether I will eat all of these.";negative
Like others have stated, this Twinings Earl Grey Tea does not taste like normal Twinings Earl Grey Tea. It does not have the smell or taste of earl grey. I think it's stale. I'd avoid it.;negative
It was nothing like what I thought they should be knowing how delicious their other products are.  Dry, hard, and lacks flavor.  I'm glad I bought only one box.;negative
They are really nice, but the red will come off.;negative
This Mango Peach Passion cereal is very hard.  I was afraid I was going break a tooth.  The cereal also was lacking the Mango and Peach flavor.  There where little tiny hard pieces of mango and peach.;negative
I am not a fan of the taste of this combination.  The celery shockingly overwhelms the taste of everything else.  Kinda icky for me.;negative
Ok, I don't like it all! The cereal tasted like cardboard box, and has nasty flavor. Finally I had 4 boxes left cause nobody wanted to eat them. I didn't want to waste them, so I used them to feed my chicken.;negative
They're weird, oddly sweet, mealy, chewy things. I don't know what to do with them. I don't like them enough to eat them on their own. I'm going to try to make the creamy beverage out of them...;negative
As far as organic popcorn this is not the best I have found.  Trader joes has a superior organic product.;negative
I had a bad experience with this coffee flavor for several reasons.  The taste lacked the flavor or even hint of flavor of blueberry and the aroma was not very pleasent.  It's not my BREW.;negative
Strong on artificial flavor, but taste like cheap supermarket, bulk bin coffee you buy by the pound. I expected more from something with the CBTL name. Perhaps they are just licensing out their name....;negative
Great for only five minutes, if that. Then just chew until your jaw drops. No taste.  Sorry.  Not for me.;negative
sorry to say the stuff in them aren't as good as good health - these have more crap in hem and are not gm;negative
Great it is vegan but very difficult to stir the stuff when initially opened - anyone with arthritis will need to find a friend with strong hands;negative
"I can't imagine buying these again; flavor profile is okay but not extra special and too sweet. Serving size misleading, as fills up half the cup or less, even when water added";negative
the box was opened on arrival. The cookies were shuffed in an open box. Arrived on February 9th with an expiration date 020416. No more rotten cookies.;negative
tastes terrible. very strong alcohol taste. doesnt really make anything sweet;negative
This creamer is good but it's too much money. You can only get a few cups of coffee out of each little box. I was expecting much more. Very disappointed.;negative
I did not like this product. I will not buy again from this vendor.;negative
Same great product, but too few sticks per pack and way too much packaging!;negative
Stuff is great if one likes chemical spice. Has yellow no 5 in it and some of that stuff in capital letters.  I won't eat crap like that. The vendor was horrible to me.;negative
The first time I bought this it was great. The second time it came with a lot of lumps. Will not buy this again.;negative
its made by pepsi.  tastes like chemicals.  not as bad as g2 obviously.  I was desperate.;negative
Artificial sweeteners leave my drier than before I consumed the beverage.  Barely any ginger taste to this..cute cans.;negative
Looking for a healthy snack?  I had high hopes since I love Apple Cobbler.  But this is too dry and doesn't have a strong apple cobbler flavor.;negative
Was not a fan...they flew all over the place when trying to cook!;negative
Gross. Made a tofu based pudding with this, was dry and gross. This stuff stinks;negative
I eat lots of Tasty Bite Indian food and rice but I did not care for this Pad Thai;negative
"Don't taste as ""fresh"" as ones I've bought at market.
They are good. I do have one with my coffee.";negative
I bought this thinking I was getting the same sugary gum as it once use to be. But it is not!!! Aspartame is in this product as well as the sugar. The color is even yellow now.  Very disappointed!;negative
THIS IS A TOTALLY FLAVORLESS PRODUCT. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. AND ONCE YOU BUY IT YOU ARE STUCK WITH IT...NO RETURNS. INTO THE TRASH IT GOES.;negative
I'm not a fan of the taste, the dates are very hard and I would prefer the cereal without them.;negative
I was thrilled by the potential of these sticks, but had a problem with the slightly gritty texture - couldn't make it past half of one stick.;negative
9 minutes, not one kernel popped. Not sure what the deal is.;negative
This must contain 90% peanuts and kind of bland and the chocolate chips, peanut butter chips and M & M's were melted.;negative
This is not a bold coffee. Barely any flavor. A waste of money.;negative
This Double Chocolate Whey didn't taste like chocolate... it tasted old and had a strange after taste (not from stevia).  I would not buy it again.;negative
Taste is not good. Similar to chewing on a branch in my opinion. Also shipping was expensive. Not worth the money.;negative
Not so good, seem to be old when I got them.;negative
Doesn't taste great and has a chemical smell. The double chocolate tastes good;negative
Great price for organic walnuts.  Delivered on time.  Now I know why--they were terribly stale.  Don't buy them unless you want to feed them  to the birds and squirrels all winter long.;negative
Got this on 1/13 and best to use by date on it is 1/16.  Too expensive to be sent this close to expiration.  Also this cake is really small!!!;negative
The chocolate was white so I guess I ordered it at the wrong time of year. I purchase it locally and love it usually.;negative
My cats were too picky.  They didn't like this at all.;negative
Not a good taste. Had to throw away.;negative
I have changed my mind on this product. It used to have a decent amount of peas and corn in each bag. NOW there must be 80% tomatoes and carrots and maybe 20% peas and corn.;negative
This may taste OK but it looks like the sweepings after all the good stuff is gone. Definitely not what I was looking for nor what I would put into my pot;negative
i love these grits, but i'm not paying $133 for them. WTH???? this was $12 two weeks ago. fix this please.;negative
"Definitely not as good as the refridgerated Tropicana which is delicious. There's a ""burned"" flavor in this.";negative
Did not taste the same nor have the same thickness. Have bought dressing from Olive Garden so know what I'm saying.;negative
After reviewing product. I was hopefull it would have work according to its ad. So I got excited,  bought a case and  tried it for myself. In my opinion, im very dissopointed and will not buy again.;negative
Thin, not especially flavorful, and inconvenient to prepare.  I can't understand the enthusiastic reviews for this product.  I love Thai food and this was a disappointment.;negative
I should have read the other feedback! The chocolate was melted when it arrived, so I stuck the package in the refrigerator. I opened one packet later and this is what the product looked like.;negative
Tastes great but leaves my stomach in agony.;negative
Very disappointed. Tasted old. Very hard. I had these before and they were nothing like this.  Will not buy again.;negative
Went back to bag tea.  Didn't think the K-cups for tea was strong enough in taste.;negative
Lacks flavor//cant put y finger on it but will not buy this brand again;negative
Arrowroot powder bag was damaged and placed inside another bag. There was powder everywhere. I would rather not consume an item that was not properly sealed.;negative
The flavor is very flat. I will not reorder.;negative
"I think this product may of been old.
I have used this brand before but I have never bought it through amazon.

It just tasted funny and had lumps.
my husband even asked if I had put fruit in the frosting.";negative
Yuck, Blecch, awful!  I don't Iike to drink water, but if the choice was water or this, I'll take water every time.;negative
Crap compared to Philippine Dried Mango. Tastes like the made mango mush and dehydrated it.;negative
I love simple mills. But so unhappy when I got these and they had sugar in them.... I don't eat sugar.. even if I did the amount of sugar in these is ridiculous.... Not healthy.;negative
Not fabulous, nor even great. They are ok.;negative
not my thing I guess. give me regular peanut butter any day.;negative
gave these away.  expected mini cream eggs;negative
very low quality coffee - not espresso roast.;negative
"These were not in original packaging and the mix was a clump inside the cup.  I tried them anyway, but was not impressed.
I have had this brand in the past and it was just fine.";negative
can hardly taste it and it doesn't really taste like chocolate;negative
I don't know , wasn't as i expected,  quality wasn't that great.;negative
"No wonder they were so cheap.  They don't work very well in my machine because of the ""biodegradable"" packaging.  I wouldn't buy them again.";negative
Did not taste anything like Nespresso coffee.;negative
Poor quality control, 1st purchase was great, 2nd purchase has lots of bad nuts, some hard as a rock, dark inedible.;negative
Horrible tasting will not buy again.;negative
The decoration on the pops is sloppy and overall quality I feel is poor. Didn't like the taste either.;negative
Did not redox for shipping.  Came in original boc with shipping label for everyone to see contents.  Was to have been gift.  That was ruined.;negative
melted and couldn't eat it. no help from the seller. will never order again.;negative
received the product but unable to try do to 7 out of 12 cans badly dented. waiting for amazon to resolve issue before making final judgment on product. Will update after being contacted byAmazon;negative
This is the worst product I ever brought. The shrimps are all broken, and it smells horrible, almost like plastic.;negative
Has no coffee taste very weak won't order again;negative
Don't like the taste and has too little coffee in the mix.;negative
Not creamy enough and extremely sweet!;negative
Like chewing an old tire. No wonder it was added to order at no charge. It's not your childhood gum.;negative
Does not taste as good as they tell you.;negative
Its okay but I won't buy it again.  Its very rich and heavy for my tastes.;negative
I am not accustom to buying turmeric root but non of these roots were bigger than my little finger. Most recipes instruct pealing and grating but with this root after pealing there is nothing lift.;negative
Just could never get use to the taste. Had to pitch it! Sorry its like thick and dark brown and I will not order it again.;negative
I wound up giving this to my mother, who can't eat certain meats, but likes the flavor of them. I thought they were a little rubbery.;negative
I hated the flavor of these noodles! I threw them all away!;negative
was smaller them the pic makes it look.  I would not get this again for the price that it is;negative
Boxes were dented, a few pods dented can't use them.;negative
If I could give this product a -5 I would.;negative
I have always liked licorice laces.  But not these....They are flimsy not firm.  It tasted like super sweet fruit punch not strawberry.  They were so bad I threw them away.;negative
Watery not much peppermint flavor. Not worth it.;negative
They have ruined it! It tastes like bathroom cleaner! I cannot drink this new clear zevia! Disgusting! I used to love it, why did they have to change it?;negative
Product was open when I recieved threw away;negative
It's not that great and cooking with it is not good, leaves a really bad smell and taste;negative
It's mostly spinach, and the few leaves on non-spinach became wilted and slimy shortly after opening.;negative
We just don't like the flavor of these chips. It tastes less like white chocolate and more like a candy. The hunt continues for dairy free white chocolate chips.;negative
Gave the rest of the bag away.  Didn't like it at all.  Maybe low acid, but I didn't care for the taste.;negative
I love cinnamon, but this isn't your normal cinnamon. It has a very harsh flavour.;negative
"Tried it once and tossed it; We found that it had an odd flavor.";negative
My husband is a HUGE DOTS fan, they are his favorite candy.  I saw these & thought they would be a great stocking stuffer....he hated them. Not the usual flavors, we wound up throwing the box away....;negative
Worse tasting shake I've ever had. Tastes like chemicals;negative
tasted nasty. Wish I could return, but I already opened. It tastes very artificially sweet.;negative
Good taste, but packaging was less than desirable and the product as a whole presentation was not attractive.  It could not be used as a gift as was the intention.;negative
"These have no flavor. They all taste the same. They are way too sweet and my kids don't even like them
And they love gummy candy.";negative
I found a large mass of something that looks like part of a gray hairy rat, in the package. Thank goodness I poured them out on a plate and didn't just eat out of the bag. I threw the rest away.;negative
Not good coffee tastes like cardboard, will not reorder.;negative
Not what it used to be.  Not good at all.  Tasteless apples.  I prefer apples packed in water, but these did not even taste like apples.  Amazon should not offer these in the future.  PS  I'm a good cook.;negative
To many Almonds were busted in the bag for my taste. Needs better quality control at this price!!!;negative
thought we were getting 4 jars for 20 dollars ...turned out only 1...not even in the ballpark for savings.please print more clearly the product and quantities.;negative
This coffee has very little flavor. Tastes like a very very mild blend of coffee. I would not purchase again.;negative
I bought this for baking use and this did not give me the strong lemon flavor punch I was looking for even with me adding a bunch of the powder.  I will not be purchasing this again.;negative
"How disappointing!  Broken, stale & container bottom full of fine crumbs. First order perfect. This is second & last order until I crave my most favorite cookie. Nothing ""fresh"" about this order.";negative
Cracker much too hard for me to chew.  And the taste is no taste.  I will not buy again and would not recommend to anyone.;negative
Way way overpriced.  The box is tiny.  The cookies are too. I looked back on the invoice to see what they cost and realized I'd been snookered.;negative
Not my favorite. It was grainy and over time the oil separates from the solid components and it it is very difficult to stir.;negative
I love Steaz but the zero calorie drinks have that diet soda after taste. And I hate that, I'm managing to quickly finish these off but I will never buy these again.;negative
Oh man this was really gross. Should have known better than to order meat through Amazon.;negative
I love this candy. But the stuff I received was rock hard. I can't eat it for fear of breaking a cap or filling.;negative
This was a waste. I hate the taste, I hate the texture of the noodles. I would donate to a food bank or something but I don't want to torture anyone like Ive been.;negative
"In the Spanish version of the ad it puts a pack of 6, but it is only one bag.
""Chester's Puffcorn Butter Corn Cake Snacks, 3.5 oz (Pack of 6)""";negative
You will lose weight because these are like super bland babyfood. I've had more taste with styrofoam and buffalo sauce.;negative
Flavors taste weird like chemicals and I only drink stevia so I was really disappointed;negative
yeech!!!! Someone finally figured out how to produce bad tasting coffee in a kcup;negative
Basically tastes like a salt like. Mine are also all stuck to the wrappers like they had been in heat. Poor quality was delivered. The melting may have actually changed the flavor.;negative
Tastes very artificial too tangy not pleasant at all i have to force myself to finish my coffee which is never because i am a coffee addict;negative
Terrible taste and will NOT buy again! Cheaper at Walmart, started to return it due to the bitter taste but I decide to keep it and throw it away!;negative
On a scale of 0-10 this is a weak 3.;negative
These Raisins are quite bad if you wash it, you will see it's made from rotten grapes. Every time I ate it, the gas builds up in my stomach, felt so uncomfortable and stopped eating it.;negative
This product is disgraceful! There is a hint of coriander flavor in it, but by appearance and taste it's clearly been cut with some other, cheaper herb -- or, I would not be surprised to learn, sawdust.;negative
Too much sugar.  Not enough Kari and baking power.  Have very little taste.;negative
The taffy was stuck to the paper and did not come loose. I tried it on 6 pieces. I got fed up and discarded them.;negative
Gross.  We threw these out after tasting;negative
I was looking for something more natural;negative
"Great idea. LOOKS like it should be good however, tasted neither salty or buttery, or even ""pop-corny"".  Boost the flavor all around and they may be onto something. Very disappointed.";negative
"price too high.  use to be subscribed to this until it jumped by 24%+ in price.

so better off buying locally now";negative
I thought that the aftertaste would not be present since the product contains Splenda.  No so.  There is a sour and very unpleasant aftertaste to these candies.;negative
Didnt come in a box just loose, couldn't use them or return it, disappointed;negative
Very disappointing! Smells and tastes like the fake butter in fake buttered popcorn. Mixes easily in cold water, but taste thin.;negative
Terrible. Everything was dry..almost as if it was rotten. We threw all of these away.;negative
Once candle holder was cracked completely in two!;negative
Fake flavor added. Very potent smell and taste. Not natural.;negative
"If you like thick pickle soup, you'll like this, because it's not relish.  It's thick soup with barely a taste.
Wickles is ten times better.";negative
They have a weird half mint half cinnamon taste and lacks the chalking texture I love.;negative
Haven't been very happy with stevia products - and I have tried several.  I always go back to sweet and low;negative
Taste is off.  Will be going back to my old Half & Half from the store.;negative
ther ewas some icky tasting crackers ..mold??;negative
Love Lara Bars !! Love coffee !! This bar tastes terrible....has a bitter/sour note that's hard to chew past. All other flavors of Lara Bars ROCK!;negative
I was not too crazy about this. Maybe it was the caramel. I would like to try the apple cider minus the caramel in a sugar free form and see if there is any difference.;negative
Although we love Hellmann's and will continue to buy it, when we opened the box some of the mayo had leaked out somehow. Disappointed, but i'm sure Amazon will take care of it.;negative
My wife said it taste nasty and threw most of the box away after we ordered a different kind. Said it was nothing but hot water even on the small setting;negative
Meh. Not a very pleasant taste even when blended into a smoothie. I think next time I'll try a hulled version.;negative
I would have given these a 4 or 5 but I received an open package with several broke suckers;negative
But a bottle arrived leaking a little bit. I won't order it again. It needs packaging that will go thru the mail!;negative
It did not taste good at all.  Made me kind of sick.  I also had a taste in my mouth for awhile.  Don't want to order that anymore.;negative
It died. The leaves starting getting brown spots shortly after it arrived. I tried to save it but it died anyway. I guess other people have had better luck with this plant. Won't be buying another one.;negative
"We did not like it.  The sauce has chunks of ""stuff"" in it, which are not shown in the photo.  Not for picky eaters who are used to duck sauce that is just orange goo.";negative
It's more bitter than it is strong. I have a cast iron stomach & 1 cup of this & I'm doubled up with cramps.;negative
Reformulated without cinnamon and sweetness available before.  Unsatisfactory... avoid.;negative
Really didn't care for the taste.  I'm afraid I'm hooked on Twinings Earl Grey1  sorry.......;negative
This was a very weak blend of coffee that was mislabeled as medium blend, should be light blend, otherwise nice flavor but weak!;negative
Does not taste like Cinnamon Crunch. It tasted different.;negative
I prefer the hickory smoked jerky because the maple flavor seems too sweet an it over powers the bacon.  The cuts of bacon seem to be from the fat end of the pig with little meat attached.;negative
TERRIBLE. Each type of the soft cookies tastes the same: VERY sweet, sugary. One bite was enough for our children.;negative
SOME OF THE PACKAGES INSIDE THE BOX ARRIVED OPEN SO THERE WAS BAKING SODA LEAKING OUT OF THE BOX.  THEN, THE FIRST PACK I OPENED HAD ***BUGS IN IT*** SHAMEFUL!;negative
The fact that this has both HFCS and regular corn syrup, along with sugar is a bit disgusting. You can tell HFCS leaves a nasty film all over the inside of your mouth. Pretty much ruins it for me.;negative
I do not recomend these. Very slimy and mushy. Not a great taste or texture. Sure they are canned mushrooms. I have had much better.;negative
"I love their other flavors and usually love ""lime""....however not with this product!  The regular lemonade and the watermelon are the BEST flavors...in my opinion.";negative
For me I like the red twizzlers ONLY. The other flavors for me were horrible. Tasted strange. Fake. Left a bad taste in my mouth. But that is me. I love Twizzlers ...just red and black I guess...LOL;negative
Awful!!  Tastes like wet tobacco in a cup.;negative
As  a another reviewer said could have had more  lemon flavor,  And what's worse  the 1st one that I had opened up the top just just  broke  and I had neither had it long nor  used it much;negative
I've been  searching for a full flavored Ginger Beer - like the ones I had for years in India. While this one is good, well made and flavorful, it is mild and so does not measure up to my goal.;negative
Maybe good for baking and cooking with but taste horrible. threw them out!;negative
This Product is so TART Tasting. I can't eat them.needs a Zero rating.;negative
hard on throat..  probably won't repeat.  it is definitely hard on the throat like another reviewer mentioned.;negative
I hate the menthol aftertaste. Going to try other options.;negative
Absolutely horrible. Tastes worse than the cheapest chocolate I've ever had. Disgusting. Waste of money. I had to throw it in the trash.;negative
Unfortunately, this flour did not work out for me. It has a kind of gooey texture. I think it might work better if combined with other flours.;negative
did not realize they were packed in oil, couldn't eat;negative
I love Katjes salted licorice so I thought maybe I would like these, but they make me feel sick and taste like they contain molasses.  I don't like molasses, but if you do then you would like these.;negative
I will never buy again I thought it was a case. A can here goes for 3.00. I just thought i would get a case for that price. What a joke;negative
"Read everything - I didn't, this has guarana, ginseng and B vitamins.
I saw the size and Starbucks and didn't look much further.  Duh-me.";negative
I love chick peas but these were dry and tasteless--I have had better;negative
Over half the packages were stale. Avoid this product. Never had any issues with the larger bags. Company definitely needs to look into quality control of their smaller bags.;negative
Nice enough but....product was almost out of date;negative
"Should have researched side efforts first..

My bad.";negative
This Cereal  is  gross...Do not believe  the 5 star Reviews!  Do not waste your Money on this  one...Others  taste better  but this one  no where  near  Rice Krispies...blah;negative
"I like some of the other flavors of Extra Fruit Sensations gum, but this watermelon flavor gum just tastes flat. Flavor only lasts a couple of minutes; much less than the other flavors.";negative
"They're not dried! They're like jellies.
Absolutely terrible. Don't buy these.";negative
This is the tiniest amount of product, and has just as many seeds as the kind I have ordered that are not advertised as seedless.;negative
It's strange that this flavor gave me large bumps on the back of my tongue. Possible allergy? I never had an issue in the past.;negative
It's ok , I prefer green mountain Sumtra Reserve;negative
I have purchased sugar free frenchvanilla cappuccino in the past tho not from this site...and it was way better than this. Extremely disappointed - not sweet enough - not enough creamer - not creamy at all -;negative
You clearly get what you pay for.  I could and have done better at Penzy's.;negative
"Gosh I tried to enjoy this, really.  Taste?  In a word .... gruel.  A real disappointment.
So happy a case was not ordered!";negative
great looking bottle but that's about it. My bottle smelled on the verge of going off and it also didn't have much flavor. Maybe I got a bad bottle but won't buy another one;negative
Was Damaged. Bottle was all dented but Packaging Box was fine! Had to order a different product and returned this one.  Don't think I will order from Vedica Organics again!;negative
I'm not sure what's up with this tea. It doesn't taste like lemon balm, just has a sort of generic herby taste that isn't really good.;negative
Not very good. They have no flavor. Somewhat crunchy,  but no flavor. Walmart sells some called big lightly salted, they are the best I ever had.;negative
When I read the label and saw the sugar (first ingredient), high fructose corn syrup, and lack of pumpkin in the ingredients, I did not use it.;negative
Quite dry, Fake smoke flavoring added. Not really spicy at all.;negative
I will use it up, but definitely not a reorder. A bit bitter.;negative
Never Received them in Iraq . lost money..oh well..on ly reason I give 1 star..they are 5 star delicious;negative
Came well packaged and sounds great. The taste is not so good so we gave it away.;negative
A slight overcooked taste to me. Leaves you with an aftertaste.;negative
"Read a bunch of reviews.
I must admit, I'm a coffee snob and this coffee didn't do it for me.
Very avg coffee for my palette .
A bit sharp. Like a smoother richer blend.
Service was great.";negative
Bland. If you're used to a dark roast this will let you down. ;negative
These were small yet powerful. I did not enjoy the taste. The heat of the cinnamon was way too hot for me.;negative
Not sure what is in these that triggered a migraine, but will not eat another one.  I will give them away to anyone who will take them.;negative
It is beyond my comprehension that for that amount of money, you end up with one batch of brownies.;negative
Well. This arrived open and full of bugs. Teensy bit horrifying.;negative
I was not impressed with these. I've been on Keto for about 4 months and these are some of the least impressive low-carb chocolate chip cookies I've had. Will not buy again.;negative
Thought this was pure vanilla extract... Turns out to be partially artificial. Kind of bummed.;negative
I'VE DONE EVERYTHING POSSIBLE AND THERE'S NO WAY TO GET ROD OF THE OVER BEARING BITTERNESS.;negative
The package came ripped and the box full of soy nuts that had already fallen out of it.;negative
Nasty could not drink it. Dumped down the drain.;negative
I only liked 1-2 flavors, all of them resulted in really clear weak coffee with bitter taste. I am not sure if they coffee was old or if they are just not great.;negative
Worst fudge I ever had I was so disappointed. The fudge flavor tasted like eating plain cocoa. I was wanting some creamy, buttery fudge. This wasn't it.;negative
Not thrilled about them. Perhaps as a kid I would like them but I'm not too crazy about them now.;negative
THE PRODUCT CHANGE COLOR WHILE IT WAS BEING SHIPPED THE OIL AND THE MAYO  SEPARATED;negative
Wow - I had 3 and my stomach went into knots and continued to some explosive situations. Not pretty, not comfortable. I had to toss them out.;negative
Does NOT work in Keurig. Just made a mess everywhere!!!;negative
Okay but not as good as another brand I used to buy in at Kroger;negative
Dry and lumpy... why did i buy so much?!?;negative
Bah! Food dye. Didn't notice until we went to use it for the second time.;negative
Not a fan of  this product. I love a BOLD coffee as well as the increased caffeine options out there, but this one just didn't taste as good to me. I won't be purchasing again.;negative
The cheese wasn't good. It didn't melt well, stuck together and the worst part it was so chewy.;negative
Taste is very mild had to use a lot of tea bags to get any flavor.  A little concerned I'm not get much of the health benefits from this tea also.;negative
This was really disgusting to me.. no matter what I put it in I could always taste a really gross after taste. Maybe its because im used to the powdered stevia, but im definitely never buying this again.;negative
I thought it would be close to a Boston named, orange chai. Not.  Very strong inner cinnamon plank, as preferred in Europe and in hot cinnamon hard candy. No other flavors discernible.;negative
Didn't like the taste at all. Prefer Starbucks.;negative
Maybe it was just this batch, but if these taste like Cotton Candy, you could fool me.;negative
If you are looking for black cocoa powder this is not it!;negative
I like SweetLeaf powder much better!;negative
Nice peppermint flavor but the texture is weird.;negative
Odd taste, not very good, and just didn't seem dark enough fir a house blend.;negative
"For what it's worth:
I wanted to like these. I followed all of the preparation advice available in these reviews. However, I still found them inedibly disgusting, regardless of how prepared.";negative
Thought it was a great deal for the price until I realized they put sugar in the extract.  Ill find a new brand.;negative
not what I expected in terms of taste.;negative
The only protection these candy bars had was a manila envelope. By the time I received them they were all smashed. This is my 1st time buying with this company and will be my last.;negative
"They changed the product and not for the good :(

Salt basically has been removed. There maybe one grain on each nugget.

Plan to return them.";negative
...is horrendous without tons of cream and sugar. If you like black coffee (read: quality) then don't bother. Move along.;negative
bai makes wonderful drinks, but this is just bad tasting water. I guess I should feel good because it has antioxidants, but it honestly tastes like soap;negative
I don't know why there are all these 5 stars reviews.  This tastes terrible.  Tastes like plastic.  Nothing chocolatey about it at all.;negative
Strong pice,, we should have sharks piets;negative
It's not as tasty as the other brand.;negative
These had no flavor for my taste buds. I ended up throwing out this product. Tasted to me like cardboard.;negative
this came partially unscrewed and it was all over the bubble wrap.. so won't be using it as it could be contaminated;negative
taste bad use less and more water. very false advertizing. ordered old formula got new formula... HUH;negative
Not packaged as seen crammed in bag so tight stuck together in one glob. Waste of money.;negative
Not as good as most Kipling products ----- at least for this American.;negative
These weren't my favorite.  Dry and hard to bite into.  All I really tasted was the salt.;negative
Didn't produce results like slim tea from GNC;negative
I love quality chocolate covered gummy bears.  I don't love these.  They are so lightly covered that it is just flaking off.  A crumbly mess in the bag and nothing like the picture.  Won't buy again.;negative
Not tart or tangy just sticky and sweet.;negative
Not fresh - I didn't think about the age of the pecans - they are not that good and it is hard to tell when buying via internet.;negative
"Really super oily and in the oven it was sticking to the pan and really soft
Didnt like it at all";negative
Of all the K cups this is my least favorite.  It is extremely mild and tastes like canned coffee.  Some may find it nostalgic, but I won't purchase it again.;negative
Maybe it's just don't know how to cook with this, but I would not buy again;negative
I am very disappointed of my second batch of this coconut oil. I doesn't taste  like the first batch I purchased. It has an after taste I can't describe.  So i'm not giving it but two stars!;negative
Sure you get 100 packets, but they are extremely small. Put a slice of lemon in your water instead. It will be cheaper and likely, more nutritious.;negative
I'm all about eating healthy, organic, etc., but these were horrible!!!  As a diabetic, I was hoping they would get something healthy & that tasted good.  Didn't happen.  Will not purchase again.;negative
Beware. 9 bottles here cost more than a case with most sellers.  Thought I was getting 12 thanks to the price and my poor reading  skills.  Did ship fast and as described.;negative
I was disappointed. 17 of the cups were different brands of regular decaf. I thought there would be more flavors.;negative
Although i enjoy the quality of this jerky, I found this flavor to not be very Korean-BBQish. It's got some red pepper on it that gives it a nice spicy kick, but I found it to be much too salty.;negative
There's a weird taste like there are additives or other non-coffee debris ground in to the coffee.  I switched to a different brand (Kicking Horse whole bean).;negative
"I thought these were too salty. I taste mostly salt, hardly any li hing flavor.

I won't purchase these again.";negative
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! They taste like they've been on a shelf for 10 years. The only flavor left in them is just BAD. Not minty or buttery. ICK! So disappointed. :/ Never again.;negative
Not like other HI coffee I bought direct from HI.;negative
Don't much like these bit o honey, was expecting a more almony taste to it;negative
Meh. Tastes burnt and over done. Liked Via when it first came out because it was the only instant coffee with flavor, now I realize its way too much and not worth it.;negative
They work great but the taste/strength is like watery tea. Would not suggest if you are looking for a strong espresso.;negative
Weird flavor. I love the other flavors but Carmel is hard to get right.;negative
Cause issues with my wife ...heavy breathing;negative
I READ IN THE FIN E PRINT THAT IT CAN KILL SMALL ANIMALS I WAS AT THE CHINESE RESTERUANT AND ON THE PLACE MATT THAT MY CHINESE ZODIACK SIGN WAS THE RAT. HOLY SMOKES! I GOT THE HEBE GEBBIES!;negative
"You are buying ONE I repeat ONE box with ten packets inside for this price. This advertising is
MISLEADING. I called Amazon and complained.";negative
Stale and old.  whitish powder like from age.;negative
Not enough flavor. The pops are really sharp when they break and can cut your gum if not careful.;negative
did not sit well if you know what I mean;negative
Thought they would be better......but ok;negative
I like a bolder cup of coffee so if you're taste run light you will probably like it more than I.;negative
i have had coffee from this roaster that was very good however this coffee didn't have much going for it;negative
O as an additive for protein. Very small jar for a fair amount of money.;negative
I was in love with Trader Joe's Wasabi Peas.  This version tasted awful!  I threw it in the garbage!!!;negative
OMG this was disgusting. One mouthful and I had to toss it out! I don't even have a good comparison since I usually don't put nasty in my mouth! Sawdust flavored with cinnamon perhaps?;negative
Very weak tea.  I have had stronger Green tea.;negative
These are tart yes..but they don't seem to have any real cherry flavor.  May be Ok if you plump them up in cherry or almond liquor.;negative
If you like a strong starbucks kind of coffee than this is for you. I don't like it much. It taste burnt to me.;negative
The oolong is full leaf, and has a good taste. It's not the best oolong I ever bought, but the best I have tried that is moderately priced.;negative
I wish I read the reviews! I didn't know a papaya could be so tiny. I didn't even know what it was at first. I thought maybe it was a pear. Save your money! What a ripoff.;negative
This stuff does not work for me- I get more caffeine effects from a good cup of joe. I have a strong stomach and this stuff makes my stomach feel awful.  To top it off, it tastes stale.;negative
I was disappointed that starter tea did not come with my culture.;negative
Tastes like sweet tea at first, but in the end its kind of gross;negative
Obviously because this is raw and unsalted, the taste is not the best. But I don't know, it tasted weird and kind of humid.;negative
These were so gross and I like spinach. The texture is like paper towel and the smell is overpowering when you open the bag. I tried one and threw the rest out.;negative
The falafel flavor is nearly tastless, not salty, not even much like anything. Garbanzo beans/chick peas need spice! (The wasabi was greatr);negative
This is $11.00 at Costco. What was I thinking! It's a great product I've been buying it for years but it's WAY OVER PRICED on Amazon.;negative
These are super dry and hard , not much flavor;negative
honestly , did not like it . especially the after taste ! so strange !;negative
i have bought this coffee several times in the past and it was great. this time there was just no coffee taste to it at all and it was a hundred years old. very disappointing.;negative
Odor was so strong, I triple bagged in resealable plastic bags, put it in the refrigerator until trash day and put it in the trash without ever opening. If you are not sensitive to odors, you may enjoy it.;negative
I didn't like these. I wasn't prepared for the hickory flavor and the mushy texture. I tried to give them away but haven't found anyone else that likes them either.;negative
This tasted nothing like peach.  Very disappointed and will not buy again.  I gave it away.;negative
Not really a lot of hips for the amount you pay.  won't buy again.;negative
Olive Green, Not The Leafy Green As I Have Experienced With Other Brands. Bitter Taste. Would Much Prefer A Metal Tin. Not The Foiled Bag With A Zip Lock.;negative
Texture is hard. Flavor is okay but doesn't last.;negative
would not recommend because they all showed up melted never thought to myself was not good idea to ship to AZ. but still my favorite candy;negative
Tastes like rotten fish, but gourmands love it.;negative
I know a lot of people love this stuff, but not me.  It is not horrible, but not good enough to have to choke down.;negative
Dry and stale tasting. Very disappointed.;negative
makes my mouth dry when i drink it with coffee or milk.so i will not buy it any more.;negative
So bitter! Had through out the whole thing I baked using it.;negative
thank you but I am done no more  candy on line not fresh;negative
Love this product but way way cheaper to buy at costco;negative
Just not for me. It tastes like watered down juice;negative
I love the product.  I do NOT love receiving it 3 days AFTER it expired.  Shame to send expired goods -- especially to a military address.;negative
I had to throw them in the trash. The taste is good, but they produce gas and diarrhea.;negative
Decent, chewy candy. Wish it had stronger ginger flavor. Too bland, wouldn't purchase again.;negative
I have had better and I have had worse malt balls, this particular malt ball is too sweet for me.;negative
Did not really taste like peppermint!;negative
Had an odd chocolate taste.  The Raspberry Chocolate Truffle kcups have a much better chocolate taste.  Donut house Chocolate Glazed Donut had better flavor too.;negative
These look unappetizing. Not as good as other garbonzo beans I can get at the local market for 1/3 the price.;negative
Didn't like threw away they were like a half filled chocolate ball;negative
The picture looks like 9oz I could not see the .9OZ.;negative
Not a fan.  However, I'll keep and use when I travel.  The 4th & Heart product is much better.;negative
I don't mind bitter, but acidic coffee really bothers me.  I almost oculdn't finish these beans, but I forced myself to.  Much too acidic.;negative
My fella and I found it to be undrinkable.;negative
For what it's worth I enjoy most Harney & Sons tea selections. However, this tea has a particularly off-putting flavor (as judged by me and several others).;negative
Didn't like the apple flavor - too much like a Red Delicious and not like real apple juice or cider. Chemical after taste;negative
Not much flavor. Very oily. I would not buy this again.;negative
I didn't like them so much. They are very fluffy and super easy to make but the taste wasn't great at all. Medifast were better.;negative
Product was old and very flaky due to how old it was. I was very disappointed.;negative
"These seeds were not butternut squash!
They are Spaghetti squash";negative
Product box was open & had 1 bar missing! I would've given them a minus stars if that had been an option!!;negative
This stuff tastes like its been in a warehouse for way too long. Has a stale, baking soda kind of flavor. Maybe I made it wrong, but being a complete mix, I don't find that very likely.;negative
No flavor. Tasted like mediocre machine coffee.;negative
This is not the classic malt taste of times gone by. In my opinion it is WAY too sweet due to the addition of sucrose. There are better powders on the market.;negative
"corn starch and artificial flovor
if i knew this i would buy corns starch 1lb plus for $1 and flovors it would save you a lot";negative
I am a southern girl, raised on all versions of pecan pie.  Also LOVE M&M's, but to combine the two?? Not what my tastebuds were expecting.  Way too sweet for me!;negative
very unsweet more than dark chocolate usually is;negative
Ok, got these, thinking it be like the ones I had when I was kid. Just a bit harder than the soft ones. But nothing like the classic. Which is a shame since the photo online should the clear hard ones.;negative
I know it doesn't have oil but really watery and taste is just a bit odd. Won't reorder this flavor.;negative
This is a great product but for over 10.00 a jar, they can keep it and I'll go with another brand...it was well worth it for a few dollars cheaper, but at this price point, it's really not worth it.;negative
It was gross! I was shocked that it was that bad. Huge disappointment!;negative
Overpriced  -  for a small quantity.;negative
Out of all of the ones I've tried, this is my least favorite. It's too sweet tasting and there isn't much pumpkin pie flavor.;negative
Poor questionable quality from China.  Smaller container.  A couple of the first cans I opened had strange smell and appearance.  I threw all the cans in the trash;negative
Used once in a sauce - the mushrooms basically taste like mushy nothing - not a good product. Threw the rest away.;negative
very disappointed  only about 1% spices.  wasted money!;negative
This is the worst tasting coffee ever. The flavors sounded like such fun. They aren't.;negative
it has a weird smell to it. when you make yogurt with it, it gives yogurt a weird taste. i would not buy again.;negative
my first disappointment from amazon, Ultimate snack package was two flavors of mini cookies. nothing even close to what the photo shows.;negative
Worst tasting had to ask for refund.;negative
I'm an avid taffy lover and this is not good taffy. I'm sure there are better brands out there that you can buy but I wouldn't recommend this one at all.;negative
its pepsi.  and not the same as they sell in bottles.  not organic with artificial crap. but what does one expect?  caring? lol;negative
This tastes absolutely awful.  One bite and I threw it right in the trash.;negative
Tasted like s*** and will never buy from this vendor again.;negative
This is very watery.  I was disappointed.;negative
These are incredibly bland.  Not stale, just tasteless.  They have plenty of salt, so that's not it.  I wonder if it's the packaging, thin plastic instead of glass.  Horrible.;negative
Makes one very strong cup of tea :(;negative
They all taste similar and the coffee is very weak...not for me...;negative
I did not like any of these flavors...I found the salt and pepper to be too peppery,...the rest also did not have the best flavor and I know this brand is usually one of my favorites.  Very disappointed.;negative
if this is gluten free, will not try anything else, no taste, like eating air;negative
never again. I find bread in our local stores better than that.;negative
there was something missing not impressed, no one liked the flavor here, will not be purchasing any more of this brand;negative
I ordered 2 grape fruit spreads, and I received 2 blueberry fruit spreads instead. I could not send them back because they had been opened. The spread has a good flavor.;negative
FLAVOE DISSATISFIED X 2 ORDERS TO TRY AGAIN. BLAH COLA. TRY AGAIN PEPSI OR REMOVE FROM MARKET. LOWERING PRICE STILL BLAH;negative
"A matter of taste..! Maybe someone else's favorite but I will probably give this gum away..! I love spearment just NOT this spearment..! You may like it..! It is only my opinion & my taste..!!
BDK...  ;)";negative
More caffeine than flavor. I intended to make coffee drinks more robust, like heavy roast or espresso. What I got was irritating buzz more suitable for young students getting ready for tests and finals.;negative
Gave these to a friend and they were awful, such a  weird taste and no peppermint, lots of sweetness and an aftertaste, had to throw away, missed the return deadline.;negative
Man, these were bad. I eat about anything, but considered tossing the bag. Yeah, that bad. If someone likes these things, there's something sad about that person, probably neglect, abuse, possibly starvation.;negative
First batch was okay, but next batch was super bitter, and we could not get the coffee to taste right no matter what we put into it.;negative
The coating on these peanuts contain far too much red dye and make this product bad for your digestive system.  My husband and I both had a bad reaction to this product.  I do not recommend them.;negative
t ABSOLUTELY  TASTELESS!!!  I can't believe how utterly tasteless this coffee is!  A sticker on the package said the coffee had been roasted only a few days before.  How old were the beans?;negative
I am no longer a fan of UTZ products. The chips are too salty, and they simply don't taste good.;negative
Disappointed in the flavor of this coffee.  Need to stick to the tried and true brands we enjoy!!!;negative
Unhappy with taste.  Not as peach tasting as I would have liked.  Disappointed.  Gave it away.;negative
Not cinnamon bark... straight cinnamon sticks.... Not the same thing. Not what is pictured.;negative
Kind of weak.  Based on the reviews I expected better.  The French is drinkable, others are like green mountain brown water.;negative
I waited more than 2 months and were really disappointed. The broth is more like chicken and nothing like pork bone.  The noodles are not that special either, just your typical ramen.;negative
These have a bit more of a doughy taste than the full size counterparts.;negative
Tastes like second-rate wheat crackers. Not fresh and not very herb tasting;negative
It just wasn't for me. It didn't have the bite of a ginger beer. Very sweet.;negative
Strange taste. Tastes remotely like peach.;negative
Didn't like the flavor. In all fairness I ate the whole bag over a couple of weeks because I hate wasting money. I will not buy again though;negative
don't order food and soap from amazon at the same time.  had a very bad soapy taste and made my mouth numb.  the dishwasher soap some how got inside.;negative
Not as good as other brands like Toriana better;negative
Most of the candies were melted once you got into the box.  Also they didn't taste as good as those bought in a store.;negative
I like Green tea, and I like Jasmine tea.  I did not like this tea.  I returned it.;negative
Like it a lot but now started to find bugs in unopened packages;negative
Undoubtedly the nastiest stuff I ever tried to consume. Tried it with sweetener, without sweetener and with orange juice. It is truly hopeless! UGH!;negative
Apparently they are genetically modified. Very disappointed.;negative
These are not as flavorful nor as moist as I have experienced previously.;negative
Way over priced....this is available in the 16 ounce size from other sellers for about the same price;negative
Cookies are all broken..DEFINITELY DEFINITELY  not worth it..but I must say they are good..I will never buy again;negative
Should rename this product to salt with flavoring. Pour in 90% kosher salt and add 10% flavor and that's what this is.;negative
Not our favorite. Prob wouldnt purchase again. I think its all in the texture.;negative
So guess I got a bad batch it was spoiled really nasty! So gross I would say if it has a exp. date of current year it will expire that year don't even look at the month.;negative
Have ordered twice, both times the contents were stale.  Seemed great value, but in the end they tasted worse than the 99c value cornflakes at the local store.  Not usual quality.;negative
"I wish I could give ""0"" stars!!!! Plastic bag was OPEN inside of box!  Candy was faded/discolored & gross looking!  It went straight in the trash!";negative
This is advertised ad low FODMAP but still made me very sick.  Potentially because it contains soy....;negative
They were hard as bricks!  Tried them warm and cold, neither was edible.;negative
A matter of taste, but as a chocolate and coconut lover, I expected this to taste better than it did. There was hardly any chocolate flavor for my taste buds to detect.;negative
this wasn't even consumable. don't buy.;negative
very tasty but cost $300.00 to glue my crown back on;negative
I honestly couldn't taste the espresso, very gritty.;negative
Terrible after tast!!Wast of money!!!Very disappointed!!!!;negative
"I like a stronger tea this flavor is too mild for me.

The Bombay chai is my favorite right now.";negative
no better than dollar store cookies. can't taste ginger at all! sad.;negative
I think that they taste  like sawdust.  I am Disappointed as I love both maple and pecans so wouldn't order again;negative
It would be better if it had good flavor.;negative
Plastic bottle Perrier DOES NOT HOLD carbonation.  These (unopened) bottles will be flat in two weeks.  The glass bottles hold carbonation for years, these are terrible.;negative
They all have a very fake flavor, hated it,  can't return, waste of money!;negative
"I do not like how hard these are, I was not able to give them to my toddlers for fear of choking. The Annie's Gummy Bunnies are MUCH better and easier to chew; they make a better treat.";negative
YUCK. Tastes like I boiled an old shoe.;negative
Oh, I really wanted to love these, but no, they were not for me.;negative
Way, way, way too much sugar. So sweet that is all you taste!;negative
I found this undrinkable and tastes nothing like fresh Black Tea.;negative
I like these crackers, and have purchased them several times, but the last batch I received. was a little burnt.;negative
The taste is not like it used to be from the Keurig website.;negative
I did not care for these, they were very tart, and didn't taste much like tomato.  I don't know if they were treated with something that altered the flavor or what.  They weren't spoiled, just very sour.;negative
I love mayo and I like healthy mayo which is not easy to find. But this takes yucky. Not at all like mayo and really strong even for an alternative oil eater like myself.;negative
Did not care for the tastes.  Their dinners are much better.;negative
This is not something either my daughter nor myself enjoy.  I have tried several times but cannot seem to appreciate the taste so will not be purchasing again;negative
The macadamia nut butter tasted as if it were rancid. I will be discarding the remainder. So disappointing.;negative
I thought I'd try something different and boy were these different.  Too salty and just didn't taste good.  I mean, not even remotely good.;negative
Not my type of candy.  Very thin and wasn't to my tasting.;negative
Packaged arrived with loose cap and had leaked.  It was a mess.;negative
Whatever chemical they used for the flavoring made me sick to my stomach. I wanted to love it but it was awful.;negative
Buyer beware that this product is only 3 oz., although the front cover photo posted by the seller on Amazon makes it look like it is the large 8 oz. Bag.;negative
Honestly this does not taste that great. It has a bad after taste that does not go away. I would not buy this again .;negative
I got these to put in party favor bags because grape flavor was requested. I tried one of these and I really don't care for them at all. I would have been better off getting some other grape candy.;negative
Boring.  Tastes like bland grapes.  You have to use a lot.;negative
Very tough and hard to chew. Did not like them. Go for the Black Forest organic version. Much better.;negative
I FIND THIS PRODUCT TASTE VERY TART AND ALMOST LIKE AN ARTIFICIALY INDUCED JUICE.;negative
I was greatly disappointed in this stuff. They call it cookies but it just dried out chips with little flavor.;negative
Couldn't eat this one.. taste was very bad..;negative
"Latest box I got said ""Product of China"" - Unsubscribed!";negative
Arrived exploded so I never got to try it. I've never seen it in the stores but I am still on the look out.;negative
"This garlic does not appeal to me at all. It's not the fault of the garlic; I just do not care for the taste or texture of it.";negative
This sells at Super Walmart for much less--it is really tasty though.;negative
Shrimp were overcooked and many had to be cleaned by hand.;negative
I really like this chocolate caramel combination and it is not available anywhere near where I live.  So I periodically order them just because I like them.;negative
Too dry and bitter, you can hardly eat they as they are.;negative
Terrible taste, nowhere near like sweer caramel, quite bitter.;negative
We did not like the taste of these. Like carbonated water with a little bit of flavor. We like the sodas much better like the root beer and the cola and the grape but not these.;negative
terrible foul odder and got sick every time I tried them...trashed them;negative
I loved the black bean soup bowl and wanted to venture out. My first cup had no tofu in it, the second has tofu but tastes like chalk. It leaves a nasty residue in your mouth. I won't be ordering this again!;negative
I liked the individual packaging. However once I opened a pack and tasted them. I was pretty disappointed. The biscuits taste kind of stale and have a bit of a sawdust taste;negative
Not what it used to be. We have purchased it for years. This bag tastes old or strong plus it contains more pieces of tough grizzled pieces.  Will not buy again and would caution any one else.;negative
Every single cookie was smashed and broken.;negative
Came with broken seal and it was leaking all over the package it came in.;negative
Loses flavor in 3-5 minutes (if that).  Wouldn't buy again.;negative
came in a box - disappointed it was not in the box in the photo!;negative
The walnuts tasted like old and some of them were dark and kind of shriveled. Also, the package did not have the symbol of USDA organic on it. Completely disappointed considering the price of this.;negative
These are nasty!  They don't taste good. The pieces are very small. I'm sad I spent this much money for such a low quality product.;negative
at 50$ this is overpriced and not worth more than 25$. Candies are tasty however but a few of them were crused and or melted after opening...buyer beware.;negative
Doesn't matter how much a spray and oil my pan it sticks terribly. So for that reason it was inedible and i tried multiple time by making it in smallr batches. I still have some left so ill try again.;negative
These nuts tasted good at first, but went stale and got hard very quickly. Avoid these and go fresh!;negative
I was hoping these would taste good in food. Not so much, very funky taste. Maybe it's just me not knowing how to use them.;negative
Bakes well but it is colorless and need a true dark color flour. I will not reorder this item again.;negative
The watermelon was starting to turn.  Just not a fresh experience.  Like the idea though.;negative
Another extremely dry granola, had some flavor but definitely not a snack item.  If you buy, add lots of milk !!;negative
"""When pigs can fly"" remains best brand";negative
Not worth the money sometimes they work and sometimes they just cause the water to spray out around the cup.;negative
Dark meat and some white meat. Not what I was excepting. It had no lumps in it at all, If they do not take it back it will become very epensive fish chum.;negative
"Ordered this several times. The last order tasted so ""off"" that I threw most of it away.";negative
Way too expensive .. ZERO fragrance and ZERO taste. The seeds aren't fresh.;negative
This is another product that was in my open Subs. and Save Box that I received during bad weather. It had  lost some quality. Hopefully, next shipment will be better.;negative
For me, this does not add any sweetness to the drink for which I purchased it. Stevia drops work much better. I don't know what use this product has.;negative
I usually love dried bananas but the taste deep fried in really old oil the dipped in the sugar bowl for a minute. still going to try to find ones like I have had in the past;negative
Returned because it contained xylitol too.;negative
I like this brand, but there is too much clove flavor in this blend. It ruined my last meal.;negative
I don't find these too palatable. Too hard and flavors are funny.;negative
"Whole cashews, my foot! The correct name should be ""halwes and pieces"". There were very few whole ones among them!";negative
this is not even close to real Hollandaise sauce. Also it take more time to cook.;negative
Barely taste peppermint. Mostly just sugar syrup.;negative
I'm sorry. These taste nothing like an English muffin.;negative
Container was smaller than expected, and had more peanut butter taste than cinnamon. Not worth the large calorie content. Unfortunately, I will be giving this away.;negative
The look pretty . But they left out the main ingredient. TASTE. They suck.;negative
I love most kind bars but not this flavor.  I'd recommend selecting another.;negative
Sorry, but I just didn't like the chemical taste.;negative
Too sweet, not as I remembered it but for others its a tradition.;negative
I was disappointed that the popcorn was stale chewy not at all what I'm use to;negative
These are not as good as Snyders Gluten Free pretzel sticks. The texture is just too soft and crumbly, not crisp like Snyders Gluten Free ones.;negative
I have been a Timothy's decaf drinker for a year but thought I would try something different.  The Tully's is a little too weak for my taste.  Not bad but not great!;negative
I personally didn't like it - oily and unappealing, however I'm giving it two stars - as it didn't get moldy! just personal taste, you might love it.;negative
Received and best by date is still 5-6 months out, and at bottom of bag several are moldy. Dug one up for picture. Not worth almost $25, wasted money. Trash.;negative
Not spicy at all compared to the same product when bought in France??;negative
It is okay but not outstanding like the gold variety two of the cans out of six were bent inwards and cans were open under the plastic top. Beware of sellers other than Amazon!;negative
Not the Tim Horton's taste I love.  Tasted stale;negative
These are seeds with some tamarind and lots of sugar on top. Big seeds too. As a vegetarian it's not impressive in the least that it came from a fish market.;negative
This thing sucked. Nothing grew. After 3 months I threw it in the trash. What a rip off. Very disappointed.;negative
Soooo hard to calculate how much I'm actually putting in the drink.  Convenient to carry, though.;negative
Pie did not have much flavor. Also charged insane amount for shipping, was labeled to keep frozen until ready to eat, yet arrived warm with not ice pack or any attempt to have kept it cold.;negative
The low grade plastic liner ruptured near the bottom when I was trying to fill a container and spread grape-nuts all over my kitchen floor.;negative
Has a really strange unapealling taste. Tastes rancidlike, would not purchase again.;negative
Awful!!!!!!!  They do NOT rehydrate well. After rehydration, they taste like rice crispies.  No flavor of blueberries noticed my me or my husband.;negative
I see this is now 30 bucks for 2 bags, shipped.  What a joke.  It was ok when it was less than fifteen, but youd have to be nuts to pay the current price;negative
Clams were very chewy. I am going to order a different brand.;negative
Not as described looks a lot but don't let the picture fool you.;negative
Smells like dust, tastes like dust and not one family member could identify it as cinnamon (Ceylon or otherwise).;negative
"horrible quality! tried twice..and taste is just not right!
The other yerba mate is what I use.
Guayaki Traditional Organic Yerba Mate";negative
i use these to make my shakes with in the mornings. i was very disappointed in this brand. they were spoiled or sour when i opened the bag. they went right in the trash.;negative
The nuts taste old so now they're sitting in my freezer and no one is eating them. Very disappointed and won't be ordering from this company again;negative
Be careful!!!I ordered the MINI and the 2nd and 3rd box has the Huge ones!! NOT the MINI!Needed them as samples! Mini has several dozen! Huge ones only about a dozen!;negative
I have recently been given a Keurig Brewer.  This is a very nice sample of teas for me to find out what I like.;negative
the first order, was good. the second one, from ' new mall ',,  the heart burn and reflux was awful. maybe the seller doesn't matter. I don't know.;negative
It is effective for about a few days, then it causes constipation.  Don't recommend it.;negative
Half the size they should have been and stale . Had to get a refund and told to throw them away.;negative
Candy was old and stale. Several pieces had a discolored top on them. Would not buy again.;negative
The ghee actually tasted quite good with a smooth consistency//but considering the jar was half full/or half empty depending on how you wish to look at it..I will not purchase again;negative
I have made several passes at cooking, different times etc. results are terrible. Tastes like paper mache!  Sorry that I ordered a case. Fettuccine is fine, haven't tried spaghetti yet.;negative
Tastes like it's the bottom of the coffee pot, every time!  Disappointing.;negative
Good product, but more than half of the cans were dented which is a problem.;negative
This is one tiny little pot of dust sheesh could they spare a little more?;negative
The people who say this has a cheesy flavor has never tasted cheese, or has no memory of it. It's more salty, and yeasty. It's hard to explain, but it's not a flavor my mouth understands or likes.;negative
This tea ia a little stronger than most English Breakfast flavors I've tried so I just dilute it with more water and then I can enjoy it.;negative
I have enjoyed the Lakerol sugar free pastilles. However, these taste horrible!!! I gave them away.;negative
This box might have been an exception but I was disappointed that none of the bags popped well. It produced very little to eat and  left many kernels unpopped.;negative
taste funny, did not taste like clean apple juice;negative
This product definitely has a weird after taste. It's alright but I can't recommend.;negative
More than half wouldn't work in my 2.0 Keurig but was refunded right away;negative
The pretzels arrived all broken! I had to eat them with a spoon. I was very disappointed that they were not in an acceptable condition to serve to guests.;negative
I bought this mainly because it is organic.  I can't tell anything special about the taste compared to bulk at the local grocery story.;negative
Found remnants of a bug/feces (?) while sifting through the flour.:( I returned the product as a result.;negative
These showed up stale and inedible.;negative
This doesn't taste good. It's akin to Folgers coffee with chicory thrown in. I'm sure if the coffee was better, this would taste better. I'm very picky about my coffee and this just doesn't make the cut.;negative
This was one our office didn't like too much. We have more of a taste for the stronger blends. It's alright, will not reorder.;negative
Tastes terrible and has a ton of MSG!;negative
whole package off tasting due to premature opening of package. Had to throw it out.;negative
too salty. It is kind of taste like crab, a very very salty crab.;negative
"These were ok, but they didn't have the lovely ""soapy"" taste of Snaps... won't order them again.";negative
"These don't work, they are either too hot or when they get to tolerable right temp they cool off too fast
A waste of money";negative
As far as decafs go,... this one is very, very weak;negative
Seems very gristly and rubbery with  very little actual meat.  Not returnable. A huge disappointment;negative
This product was no so good. Others may like it but our house hold didn't. The service was fast and they arrived on time.;negative
While others might like this product, it was too sweet for me. Too bad that the mfg didn't provide a smaller size to sample a variety of their products. I'd rather have done that.;negative
Doesn't taste like true kettle corn.  More like popcorn with some artificial sweetener on it.;negative
I hated the taste. No idea if they work or not.;negative
Purchased the 24 boxes of Sun Maid raisins from PortmanGoodsOKC and they were stale.  I had to throw them away as they were edible.;negative
Not impressed. Their bread is much better.;negative
The dispenser doesn't really work -- the tablet gets stuck in the aperture and isn't released. Just get in bulk and transfer to a glass jar.;negative
"I've been using this for 12+ years, and this last batch was SO HOT!  Way too hot for a ""medium"" salsa.  I'm not sure if there is another product that is more consistent.";negative
Yuck....tough as nails kernels stuck in every tooth. Where's my Orville.;negative
Enlarged breasts! Beware...not a good thing.;negative
Not as healthy and it claims. Not good for low carb diets either.;negative
"This one is much worse that the ""creamy caramel"" I just threw this one away and bought the one I wanted.";negative
"Ordered this (by mistake); saw at local store for a third of what i paid here.  Oh well, at least it tastes sweet :)
Disappointed to see Amaz0n allowing these sellers to operate on their website...";negative
I don't think this is a good buy. the drink is unflavorable. Let them put more cocoa ln and it may taste good;negative
I have to return this one is for the recall......;negative
It smells more like whole grain quinoa flour.  which is known to have a slight smell, but does not go over into the baked item.;negative
"Bitter as some have said. Sambuzon is more berry tasting.
Will not buy this brand again.";negative
Did not like this product, it's nothing like the 2 Go or the bottled Italian crme is. Ended up donating it to a Church;negative
Ok but not much peanut butter in them.;negative
"Yucky. They taste like my sister cooked them with an Easy Bake Oven. Doughy, no flavor yecch. Understand why they are an ""add on item.""";negative
I was surprised  by the amount I received. Where am I going to store that size bottle?;negative
These are as hard as a rock. Not that nice soft marshmello like when we were kids or they lead you to believe. I am not a complainer but Please don't buy you will be sad ;negative
The coffee felt old. Never buying this again.;negative
Great taste, ridiculous price.  Now available at my small grocery store for much less.;negative
Not the same as a contadito ... It is more like a cafe con leche with a slight burn flavor at the end. It's not bad it's just not what I expected. I blend it with others;negative
"Every can was dented...will not re-order.
Jim";negative
Even with only 6 oz. of water used, there's almost no taste to this coffee.;negative
My taste-test doesn't find this as miraculous as some of the other reviews do. Doesn't taste much like real salt to me.;negative
They were fine, wish I'd gone ahead and ordered organic, bulk.;negative
I got a refund on this it was so terrible. Do yourself a favor and stick with simply lemonade.;negative
Just bought a new box and so far ever single pod has left grounds and blocks my Keurig.  It is not my Keurig because my other coffee pods (VanHoutte) I order is just fine.;negative
I don't know what's up with this, but the almonds just don't taste fresh and natural.  Maybe I got a bad batch, but there are better almonds out there.;negative
Too expensive and not that good. Overpriced!;negative
Mints shipped were over three months past expiration. Additionally, the case had been opened and blank stickers applied to the outside wrapper of each and every box to cover the expiration date.;negative
These were good but not at $9 for five servings.;negative
hard to tell if any of these things are that different.  basically what you taste is: pepper, barbecue, and some meat-like stuff.;negative
Died quickly. We did everything we could have done. I guess we need to make our own plants.;negative
"WARNING:  This product contains chemicals ... known ... to cause cancer ...
What chemicals?  I thought this product was organic.
Plz explain.  Sounds like I should return these ASAP.";negative
"Nice aroma; Extract, not synthetic.

However, a bit weak and off in the flavor department.  I'll use it again and modify if that's my impression.  Some products in this line are quite good.";negative
Not a good price, easily can find cheaper at any grocery store.;negative
It is not like the small fava beans.;negative
Horrible!!!!! Would never buy again. Awful!!!!;negative
had a funny taste to them, not very soft either.;negative
Wow pretty disappointed when it said on the fine print that it was going to be a case 10 bags  only got one do not buy its a lie;negative
"Failed.
I don't know if this is energizing but it tastes awful.";negative
I love Provolone, but this tasted like plastic..;negative
You have to be a dedicated Paleo enthusiast to enjoy these wraps.  Sorry, I thought they were God-awful.;negative
This not all that good in my opinion. It tastes kind of like fake coffee...;negative
It received from Grounds for Tea was smashed, distorted and partially melted.;negative
First order delicious. Second order, past it. Better to buy produce locally.;negative
This review is for the estate green tea I'm truly not impressed with it didn't have a good taste and had much extra plant matter.;negative
Not decaf not kureg 2.0 compatible can't drink due to allergies.;negative
These king of taste like plastic, and definitely have the texture of plastic. No need to give these a try. I you want an individually wrapped fruit chew, try tootsie's 'Fruities'.;negative
Not what I thought I was buying.  This more like a Cheeto's Puffed than anything in the realm of real gourmet white cheddar popcorn.  Live and learn.;negative
I really wish I had something good to say about this coffee. The flavor was terrible and it even smells nasty. Won't buy again. The cups are cute and I got it for a very good price. Don't be fooled!;negative
Expensive! I got more from the store for $.75 cents;negative
I like the SeaSnax but they are too difficult to use in this form. The sheets break very easily and just make a mess everywhere.;negative
Licorice was very hard and not pleasant tasting to me. Couldn't even give it away.....I guess I like softer and sweeter licorice.;negative
PRODUCT IS STALE, TASTE TERRIBLE, BUT THE SQUIRRELS WILL EAT THEM. I THREW THEM AWAY.;negative
Rock hard and loses its flavor in under two minutes.  After reading the great reviews, I was very disappointed in this product.;negative
This is not at all close to the description. It smells artificial and has no flavor whatsoever. I should have known it was too good to be true.;negative
This. Tastes. Horrible. Please save your money. I was all excited to receive these for my daughter's lunches. I chilled a few, took one out and OHHMYGAWD it tasted terrible!!;negative
Not as thick and rich as I like. If you like a light maple syrup this is perfect. It has a good maple flavor it is just mild. Great price.;negative
It's ok but it has a vinegary taste to it....not the best one.... I wouldn't buy again. Try the Pepper kind I love that flavor.;negative
this is perfect for iced tea.so simple.i just put 2 bags in a 2 qt. container ND PUT IT OUT IN THE SUN AND THEN I HAVE ICED TES;negative
i did not like the consistency, falvor foes away imidiatelly.;negative
opened orange crush....tastes like no flavor licorice.  haven't tried the others yet;negative
Yuck doesnt taste like coconut at all;negative
Its a little too herby for me.  If you're a hardcore tea drinker, you might appreciate the flavors more.;negative
Simply disappointing. Good packaging, ordinary taste.;negative
Unfortunately these bags were stale.;negative
"For this panettone being the NY Times Favorite - it certainly does not say much for the taste of the NY Times. It was awful, dry and had a ""very artificial"" lemon flavor. I would never purchase this again.";negative
I purchased this product because I was delighted with the chocolate coconut flavor.  Sorry to say but the Italian Chocolate Cheesecake flavor is utterly, totally, completely tasteless.;negative
Sorry, I wanted to like these but they are just gross.  Plain and simple.  Does not taste like jerky.;negative
It's ok, although we've had several bags with semi soft chips, which makes them chewy.;negative
This is used to be one of my favorite flavors. My most recent order smells like cleaning fluid and has an odd taste! I tossed it out. Please look into this!;negative
OK product the 2 stars are because from Ghirardeli  the flavor is BLAH, for the price taste like cheap brands, so save your money! I was very disappointed with BLAH flavor.;negative
Looking forward to a treat but this is very weak and tasteless tea.  For the money, I could have purchased grocery store tea.;negative
Yikes I don't know if strong is the word, it's more just bitter . Horrible flavor, very chalky.;negative
Way too salty even for me. Old Bay very overpowering;negative
Tastes nothing like penuche fudge at the country fair growing up,  went right in the trash.;negative
This had the nastiest taste. I wonder how they decide on flavor because this was disgusting. I received this as a free sample - for the cost I never would order it.;negative
"Tastes like artificial sweetener it's horrible!!!
I was very disappointed with this product !!!
Will never order again especially for the price I paid !!!";negative
Not for older children,size of candy is too small (not a blow pop).My grandchildren meet 5 or 7 to equivalent a blow pop.;negative
Almost no taste of coffee, might as well be eating peanut M&M.;negative
I missed the Unsweetened part. Tasted like dirt.;negative
Not sure why they call these raisin creme pies, pretty light on the raisins. Very disappointed;negative
"iT SAYS IT IS ""MAPLE GLAZED PECAN"".  THAT IT FALSE.  IT IS ""MAPLE GLAZED PECANS, CASHEWS AND PEANUTS"".  I ORDERED IT BECAUSE I WANTED JUST PECANS.";negative
This coffee has a decent taste, but a total waste of money if you are really looking for bold coffee, the k cups feel like they are half full!;negative
They were ok.  Just very pricey.  I could've gotten them a heck of a lot cheaper by going to Trader Joe's which is 45 minutes from me next time I have a ride!;negative
Not for me. As unpleasant as a shot of wheatgrass.;negative
Dry and no flavor... Why is it that I committed to 12 bags of this? Ugh;negative
"Its smooth & creamy but sort of tasteless - I cant taste any ""roasted"" flavor at all.";negative
Compared to other brands the quality of this is very low,  I put a lot of faith in this brand, they are good because there is never added but the product quality is secondary.;negative
Kind of low quality...  Arrived faded and not at all a pictured;negative
Way too sweet!!!  I bought it to add to cocktails and other drinks to give an enhanced flavor ... but I find it to be far too sweet for my taste.  So I will not be reordering.;negative
disgusting...all you can taste is overpowering onio (and smel) made even worse with the sickenly sweet potato taste;negative
"Buyer beware. I received a tube of something called ""Mulberry Leaf Tea"" instead of the powdered sweet green tea I was expecting. Skip it if you want real tea.";negative
"Does not taste good.  Way too ""vinegary.""  Threw it away.";negative
If you are looking for PURE vanilla this is NOT IT. I will keep it for emergency's only! Not a vanilla taste at all..taste like additives!!!!!;negative
Taste is a very personal thing.  For me, this product was utterly horrible.  I tasted it and threw it out.  It has an extremely musty odor and taste.  Very unpleasant.;negative
As we all know taste is subjective, but for me, this tastes bad.  It is far weaker than I enjoy [Sumatran is my preference] and somewhat sour tasting.;negative
Not very tasty and pretty hard. I ordered a different brand at the same time that was much better and cheaper.;negative
Doesn't have a vanilla taste and for the price yiu are better off with stevia;negative
Salt is salt for what I'm using it for but the shipping was awful. The salt leaked out and was all over. Not worth sending back so I saved what I could and moved on.;negative
Foams up like crazy is a shaker. Air bubbles fill it up and causes bloating. Never jad any other protein chale do this.;negative
tried it once, couldn't get past the taste, threw it away. The taste was  completely disgusting. Make sure you mix it into something that can cover the taste if you order it.;negative
had a flour bug in it thru  away won't order again;negative
The stated shipping weight says eight pounds so I thought this was a bulk order. With shipping, I paid more than ten times what I would have paid in a store.;negative
i really like the other flavors of Cavendish and Harvey, i thought I'd like butterscotch too.  The flavor is weak and watery instead of being buttery;negative
I have tried the watermelon aqua fresca and it isn't very good at all;negative
I'd say eh.  Was good enough to try, but not to re-purchase.;negative
I am not sure about others' reviews, but for me it doesn't taste much of peanut butter. I use it to make my protein shake and can barely taste the peanut butter.;negative
I bought after seeing the positive reviews.  I disagree with them all.  These taste like wax to me, no better than any they sell at the grocery store.  I wanted to return this purchase, they would not let me.;negative
Mostly sweet with little lime flavor or peel.  Threw it away.  Not nearly a match for orange marmalade.  Shame really.;negative
I have never tasted anything so nasty...truly.  I am not a Paleo diet person so maybe that was the problem. threw them away.;negative
Died in less than one month even with proper care.;negative
Taste is ok, and not too hard to chew.  The smell is a turn off since smells like my dogs treat bag.;negative
Not even half of the bags pop corn pops. Garbage;negative
Really chewy. Which makes sense since it's full of grains. I guess I was expecting more of a cream of wheat.;negative
Prefer the classic Nescafe, but you didn't have it the last we order;negative
"Best by date is 08/26; therefore already old and stale.  Cost too much to return as cost too much to ship to be stale";negative
I threw this out as there is no country of origin listed - it said it was packaged in the USA but where did the stuff come from originally????????;negative
Had high hopes for using these for jello shots, but you couldn't tell what they actually were once they were ready;negative
One cup steeped for 3 minutes and I had painful stomach cramps the entire next day. Needless to say, the entire box of tea went into the trash. I don't need that kind of crap - literally.;negative
Just wanted to try them out, nothing great for me or family.;negative
Couldn't even drink it it was so gross! Threw it away.;negative
the coffee tastes horrible...I just ordered a ganoderma powder and mix it into my 'good' tasting coffee.;negative
They are nothing like strawberry ones. These taste like artificial flavor and the texture makes them feel dry. Tastes like cheap kids' candy. These are also much softer and thicker,;negative
Jack Links sells their moldy Jerky through Amazon.  Pass!;negative
Not so good.  I was looking for an alternative to my normal gum.  It tastes great for about 2 minutes and then it's like chewing a piece of rubber.;negative
This company not on Amazon. Seeds came instead of powder. Tried 45 minutes in Quisinart. Nothing, a little powder, seeds not usable, raw;negative
the candy was so hard (like-a rock) i also found mold on the bottom of the bag i just threw it away ! someone from farley's & sathers should being checking what they are shipping;negative
I am not a fan of Java Factory brand k cups;negative
"I have tried several of Hoosier Farms dried powders and this is the only one I didn't like.  I couldn't get past the ""pasty"" nature when mixed.";negative
If you like strong, bold coffee- don't get this. If you like weak-reg, it's ok;negative
Even though the little ones liked this product, I thought it was bland and not much flavor to it.  I will not buy more of these.;negative
It was leaking when it arrived. Will need to send it back or get a new one as I am afraid to get it.;negative
Not so good what was all the hoopla about winning this award?;negative
I LOVE the plain Ole ginger chews. Not a fan of these. Too much peanut and not enough ginger;negative
"The ones I got weren't mini. They were at least 2-3"" wide. Can't return it due to Amazon's policy on returning food, so hence the 2 stars.";negative
2 jars of horseradish, both past their sell-by dates.;negative
Lot's of grit. I through mine away.;negative
not the quality or the size of Oh Nuts!, I won't be purchasing again;negative
tastes like swamp water like they used sewer water;negative
Unimpressed. Takes a lot to sweeten coffee. I thought this was in line with stevia powder, its not. I'm going to get less than 30 doses.;negative
Bad flavore not the same i got from Seattle;negative
I will not be buying these any time soon. yuck. Did not taste right and poor food choice. expensive. It is cheaper in food store.;negative
This stuff is repulsive and doesn't cook well at all. I rather have bisquick in moderation instead.;negative
Just not tasty at all to me, it is over priced.;negative
Instant breakfast has just as much protein.;negative
I just didn't like the taste of quinoa flakes. Meh. I'd rather eat cooked red quinoa instead.;negative
I also ordered this coffee based on the amount of positive reviews. This coffee taste pretty bad for a dark roast. Bitter, not smooth. Will never order again.;negative
No chocolate, no raspberry, no coffee....this stuff tastes like what watered down powdered coffee creamer might taste like.  Lucky me....I have 6 cans of it.;negative
They are stale. Still edible but definitely harder and more chewy than normal.;negative
Hot liquid to drink .....yes....cocoa ....???;negative
Love Lucy's cookies but this one missed the mark. Very hard and bland.;negative
I don't know if it is the formula of flavor or the xylitol that make it tastes so artificial. bought too much...;negative
I love Brazil nuts but for some reason these were very smoky or seasoned almost. Not so yummy to me;negative
I AM EXTREMELY PREDUDICED ON THIS ONE. I LOVE GOODMCORN TORTILLAS.  I FIND ALL FLOUR TORTILLAS TO BE DISGUSTING. I ORDERED CORN.;negative
There was a nasty after taste to me.;negative
They are definitely an acquired taste. Out of the six of us that ride them no one acquired a taste for them. We even went back to them a few days later they still tasted like dirt. People actually said yuck;negative
Several of last batch were short of coffee. They teasted like colored water.;negative
Love the tuna but I was my short a can.;negative
Not my favorite flavor.  I like mint tea, but I don't like the flavor of this one.;negative
I like that it is organic.  I have bought it a few times and each time I just think it does not have much flavor.  I will not purchase again.;negative
other reviews said the product was moist. Mine are not moist at all. They are hard little dried up berries. Yuck!;negative
Bland. Probably best as a table salt.  Really no finesse here.;negative
Near East is a good brand.  In this case, I believe the product was old.  I've eaten tons of couscous so I know how it is supposed to taste.  I think I got an out of date product.;negative
Did not taste good at all. Didn't eat ...threw it away.;negative
These gave me a headache, too much sugar, and other ingredients that didn't sit well.  I would not recommend to someone trying to eat healthier.;negative
Throw it Out  -  Quite possibly the Most Horrible Product E V E R put in a bag !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;negative
Of course taste is personal. I didn't care for this, found it bland and tasteless. I used 3 bags and tossed the rest.;negative
Not at all the same coffee served in the restaurants, very disappointing, have made it with French press as well as cold brew.;negative
This is the worst tasting stuff I have ever had. It just tastes so awful;negative
Hard to differentiate the flavors.  Very strong.  Not my favorite by a long shot.;negative
I will never buy this again...I would say 2 out of 5 would leave grounds in my cup.  I had to throw it out because it had so much in the cup.  Never again......;negative
It was all over the box. I can't say if this is actually a good product or not;negative
couldn't eat this product and very hard;negative
Coffee is very old. Wasn't even vacuum sealed :(. It was a ad-on. I may have been unlucky and got a bad one. There are so many good reviews, that's why I think this...;negative
"I did not like this flavor.  I tried it several times and it just did not taste right.
Once with ham and once with turkey, both times it just tased funky.
I hate to admit it but I threw it in the trash.";negative
Really don't like it. I can't get past the very intense nut flavor. Yuck.;negative
Snickers are Snickers.  The price is ridiculously outrageous!!;negative
We love this product, but the bag we got came filled with moths :(;negative
I love mayo and I love olive oil, but this combo is NASTY!!!!!;negative
I TOOK THE WHOLE BOTTLE BUT DID NOT NOTICE ANY DIFFERENCE IN HOW I FELT.  MAY I NEEDED MORE THAT A BOTTLE.  ANYWAY I CAN SAY I TRIED.;negative
I wanted to like this, but it tastes like it's old.;negative
I don't like this at all. Smells like wax burning;negative
"This Cacao powder was very ""clumpy"".  In huge clumps that I had to smash with a spoon only to break up into smaller clumps.";negative
I honestly did not like these but my friend did;negative
Dry. DRY. DRY! They arrived unevenly baked - one was burnt and the other was under-cooked. Tasted like cardboard.;negative
Terrible cardboard taste. Not like ritz crackers at all. Also seems overbaked, some crackers have almost burned spots.;negative
Very disappointed in the taste and consistency of this Ensure.  I will never buy it again!  I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy.  Don't waste your money, buy the Ensure that is regular.;negative
Will get another brand next time.  Soaked and soaked but stench did not abate.  Improved with cooking but had to mix with other grains and I LOVE buckwheat.;negative
Haven't used it, but do not like the fact that it is partially produced with genetic engineering, as stated on the label, which I could not see until it was delivered.;negative
Threw it out no taste too bad what some folks try to peddle....;negative
small, dry, hand wrapped saran wrapped, cakes. nothing special here.;negative
This is not for everyone, I didn't like it, but the next person really might!;negative
This made me sick -- as in, graphically, run to the bathroom kind of sick. Amazon's customer service was stellar and refunded me right away. Stay away from it!;negative
Disappointing, bland, not a wonderful price. I will not order again.;negative
I usually love all Dr McDougall soups, but I didn't like the flavor of this one.;negative
came out well but prefer other breads from this company;negative
Too strong would taste balanced with min or peppermint.;negative
I didn't care for this dressing because it tasted different than when I purchase at the grocery store.;negative
These are so salty and I'm not able to eat them. My kid had a great idea to put them out and dare guests to try them like our ghost pepper chips or the Harry Potter jelly beans.;negative
Pickle flavored gumballs does not taste anything like pickles!  It has no taste to it!  Buyers be aware it is A crappy product!;negative
Expensive. Taste is questionable. Verismo overall is a huge disappointment.;negative
We didn't care for this and I won't be buying it again.;negative
Was not impressed with the coffee,would not buy again. I did like that there was not plastic around the filter part however.;negative
I love Amy's for having low sodium products, whch I need due to my medical condition. That said, you'd think they could find  way to put some flavor in them. Their stuff is like cardboard.;negative
I love Irish Cream and I love Cappuccino, so I expected to love this. I don't. To me it doesn't taste like Irish Cream and I don't care for the taste it does have;negative
Gave it a try with my fingers crossed.;negative
I don't think this one is a real honey but a sugar mixed with some honey. Very strong sweetness of sugar not authentic honey. This is a fake honey. Don't buy it. I will not buy this fake product again.;negative
does not taaste right to me the cherry is over powering;negative
"taste terrible and the chai seeds get gluey and stick in my teeth.
people love them, not me.";negative
This is pretty bad coffee. Like others said, has zero body not much flavor other then the taste of old dirt.;negative
A small amount of cocoa. And a sticker with a price of 3.99;negative
has after taste. Not to my liking. I do however like some of the other flavors.;negative
Most of the tablets are crushed - I have three bottles full of powder.;negative
Not Jello's best effort!  Stick to the Sugar Free/Fat Free Chocolate Pudding - much better.;negative
the coconut flavor is none existent.  this and the cherry were great disappointment  I do not recommend these products as they are very inferior.;negative
Runs out of taste almost 5 seconds in of chewing it... also I had to eat aboit 5-10 pieces at a time to even taste the flavor... I love it's all natural but the flavor literally disappears in 5 seconds :'(;negative
It just didn't taste good and it didn't mix well either.  I finally tossed it.  I recommend you try a smaller amount before investing in a giant tube like I did.;negative
Flavor is too mild.  Needs more salt and bolder vinegar.;negative
The piece of actual fish in these is about the size of an index finger. Sooooooooo much batter;negative
very little salt. I know a lot of salt is no good for me, but salt makes the pretzel. these have hardly any salt. will not buy again.;negative
This are horrific. I threw them right in the trash. My dentist would thank me. I almost cracked my teeth.;negative
Stale and tasteless, very few peanuts, NOT the cracker jack product I expected. I won't be ordering this again!;negative
"Not as good as I expected.

The outside tastes and has texture like country-side bread. Inside filling is not as fresh as it should be.";negative
I like salt and I love David's brand pumpkin seeds very much. This brand (Bigs) is okay, but not as good to me.  There's less salt and that's important for many people, so we all get a choice!!!;negative
This has licorice in it. I think the manufacture should have clearly labeled this on the front of the bock. Licorice is a no-no for those of us with hypertension.;negative
They are sweet but they do not in any way taste like cheesecake.;negative
Not happy...........made it in popcorn maker machine and taste awful, nothing like the popcorn at the movies. Not I am stuck with a full box of these.;negative
not my favorite of their products. The rasins are Hard and sometimes Burnt, it takes to long to soften.;negative
Pure sugar - you may as well just eat a spoon of sugar. Tasted like it!  No mango taste just cloyingly sweet crunchy bits!;negative
The fat content is surprisingly high.;negative
This stuff is not good. Sorry So. Its just not.;negative
The texture didn't work for me. Taste was so-so.  I don't think I will purchase it again.;negative
Will not buy again. I have stopped buying water packaged in plastic. If you buy plastic bottle water then this product is okay for you. Not for me.;negative
Not my favorite, love the Tropical Green Tea.;negative
Horrible! Way too expensive for such a small amount. It took forever to be delivered, over a month! And it did not taste very good.;negative
Tea was so weak it was not enjoyable and many of the bags were unusable because they were so thin that the tea was coming out of the bag. There were some that I could not even use. Will send back if I can.;negative
Order just received.  My 2 bags were regular (brown bag) Godiva not the advertised Cafe Godiva in the gold bag.  Sorry, but there is a huge difference to me!;negative
So disappointed after ordering these for my Chinese Medicine class to try  as the bag was outdated and ripped open. Had to try one but they were so stale it was unreal.  Very sad .......;negative
Not what I expected.  Hard to handle and not a good flavor.;negative
I think it's the Stevia, but these really do not taste good and they make me nauseous.;negative
These have very little flavor and a slight aftertaste that is like bug spray.  Hope it isn't bug spray.  I can't believe this low quality product has the Yankee Trader brand.;negative
Old, old, old.  Dry, tastes like the great dust bowl.;negative
Received, but expiration date on all of them is in 3 days! Very dry and not fresh tasting at all.;negative
I won't buy these again. Stale with too many small pieces. Deluxe ones from Planters much better than these.;negative
no taste and no oaroma. very dissapointed would not buy again;negative
Fruity sweet. But nothing like sangria artificial taste;negative
These were Rock hard and went bad before ripening.;negative
I never tried this before. It is not a substitute for vanilla extract. It only adds brown specks to your ice cream. It has little flavor.;negative
I didn't like the agave in the Stevie.  I didn't realize that was what I bought.;negative
The taste for this oyster sauce is very, very, very, mild to the point where what is the point of using this? These seems to be little flavor and I would not buy this again ever.;negative
Mostly dust and small broken pieces.;negative
Product arrived intact and sealed but the beans had no flavor. An entire batch of cupcakes were ruined. The quality is horrible.;negative
I bought this gum because it is both dye free and aspartame free. The flavor is awful, my kids do not even like it.;negative
I was disappointed in this cake mix.  I will not purchase it again.  The cake was okay.....but, to me it did not taste like a Carrot Cake....it was more like a Spice Cake.;negative
Heard from a friend that this was the absolute best. Not sure what the hype was about. It was just ok;negative
NOT what I thought it would be.  It does not dissolve in coffee, tea, or milk on cereal.  It might be great for cooking, but I don't cook.  I would return it if I could.;negative
I don't think any scale can referrer the amount in the package. It's worth $1;negative
"To each his own; I applaud this company for trying to make a healthier wrap.  It just didn't do it for me.";negative
Very weak, poor tasting hot chocolate. Leaves much to be desired.;negative
New flavor is terrible, awful, horrible, disgusting.... The list goes on! I used to love this flavor, but whatever they did to it is awful. Why Trident? Why!?;negative
"Contains artificial colors.

What's the purpose of the colors? no food value and a possible risk of health problems.";negative
This box had about half of the pretzel bags without air in them. Meaning, these bags pretzels could have been tampered with.;negative
This is what I received. Afraid to use it.;negative
Too concentrated.  Too sweet.  Has bad after taste.;negative
Gross.  I couldn't even eat 1/2 a cup.;negative
OMG wow are you selling one can of swanson white premium chunk turkey for this high price this is awful, I love swanson but I am unhappy with one can I got in the mail for this this price of 10.49.;negative
Shipped in a way to small bag- all four bags mashed- Becoming sticky mess- Used scissors to cut bags open- not usable-Very displeased!!!;negative
Great / handy product ... but when I opened it, the container was LESS than HALF FILLED.  That makes it terribly expensive and I sure will NOT be purchasing it again.;negative
A bit too sweet and too much texture.;negative
"Not a good flavor- I've liked some of the other Walden Farm dressings- not this one
I'm using it as part of the dressing for pasta salads to use it up";negative
These are what regular Oreos were years ago. Double Stuff used to be way thicker.;negative
It was disappointing that this bag of mini-candy bars were stale. I mean, they were on sale for Christmas 2013. Actually is the manufacturer's fault, Nestles as the expiration date had not gone by.;negative
"They are not kidding when they state ""The sweet taste..."" - ugh!  The jar lists sugars as 3mg - but I'm not buying it.  It destroyed a small pot of fresh sauce with unwanted sweetness.";negative
SALT IS SALT BUT THIS LEAKS OUT OF THE TOP;negative
Tasted burnt and took a lot of grounds to make a halfway decent cup of coffee.  We prefer Koffee Kult.;negative
Since when did nut butters have sugar, but no mention of sugar added?;negative
Not great tasting. Had to throw away.;negative
Could not tolerate the smell. But that could just be us. We wanted to try it, but we ended up giving it away.;negative
The taste is okay but you can't really taste the coffee flavor, and the texture is grainy and weird.  Overall a disappointment.;negative
After first use I refrigerated the remainder and now see that after a way too short time it is growing mold.  Very expensive for no shelf life once opened.;negative
Something was missing in the taste because it did not have a beefy or salty taste. Did they change the recipe? I would not buy again. Just BLAND.;negative
Taste great but the texture is awful;negative
DIdn't like the taste. It is not really almond, more like alcohol. It's gross in coffee. It smells good, though.;negative
"For some reason or another this product always gets soggy and wet.
Do not recommend it.";negative
This tea is good if you like more of the ginger taste. But I'd prefer more of the peach flavor.;negative
i'm sure this is a great tea for fruity tea drinkers. I'm not one of those people. Maybe as an iced tea I could enjoy it.;negative
The texture is like sand. Doesn't mix nicely. Curdly. Doesn't smooth out like regular coconut cream. Not creamy at all. Will not purchase again. Would not recommend.;negative
the  almonds are very hard. taste is good.;negative
This is great tasting chocolate just as Hershey is known for, but this kind is almost impossible to dissolve in liquid! I would not purchase this again!;negative
Unless there's some recipes to use this product in, Idk what it's for! Wasn't good in smoothies, etc. Maybe for baking?;negative
French Roast review. So bitter and chemical tasting that it's inedible. I had to throw out half the box after trying to choke them down. Bummer.;negative
plain rice with chicken broth tastes much better;negative
THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT COME FROM THE USA, IT COMES FROM OVERSEAS AND WILL TAKE AN AVERAGE OF A MONTH TO GET TO YOU.;negative
"I paid $12.99 for this - one of the photos for the product showed a LOT of gumballs - of course there were no where near that many in the 1.5 lb bag.
OK flavor - not the best.
Meh.";negative
Half the bags had melted yukky globs of chocolate which may have been ok to eat but were not very appetizing to want to use. The taste was good though.;negative
The flavor was ok. We'd rather buy vanilla flavored cream to pour in our coffee. That's just our preference, though.;negative
Can half dead all the care has not brough it back to life.  Very disappointed.  We leave in Oregon perfect climate for the Azalea;negative
Good price but came smashed in the box and had to throw 2 bags away then found one that had gotten opend from being smashed in the box. So not a good price when you have to throw three bags of chips out. : (;negative
Way too much salt. My taste buds go into shock.  You can only eat a few before you need a glass of water !;negative
I think tea not good bland.  I know kiss lots of frogs before get it right.  Mild for Assam  I should have known better considering the price. Get what you paid for.  I think I will give to my neighbors.;negative
These were samples packets I have had them before from other suppliers never this size;negative
Yuck! and I'm not sure if it works to lower blood pressure. I think I might bake with it because it cost too much to waste. Pretty color;negative
Unfortunately, I found the taste off-putting. The smell was ok, very organic, but I just do not like the flavor.;negative
My son must have heard about this tea online. He started pestering me to get some, so I ordered this. It tastes like ashes.;negative
does not dissolve as well as great lakes in the green can, I would pass on this unless you like jello but agar agar works better snd more nutricious;negative
Great flavor ideas but I'm still a Crazy Cup fan. The flavor a themselves were very dull.;negative
They get too moist the way they are packaged so you don't get a crisp experience, just soggy;negative
"Beans without any spices could taste better than this.
Opened the can, ate a lil, threw it away!";negative
too little in the pkg and not a full size of goodies..;negative
I liked them but the chocolate inside made me sick, so its not really sulfite free.;negative
this box was open when i receivrd it;negative
"I could not drink this product the other ratings made it seem like this could be drank like a soda,""not"".";negative
Far too damn sugary. I may as well just eat sugar with a spoon. Yuck;negative
The coffee itself is ok. Its not bitter or anything. There was zero flavor or smell however. It was a straight up plain cup of coffee.;negative
Good, Very sweet, but only worth it if your using them to decorate with or maybe to trail mix, not anything i would purchase again.;negative
Wrong product shipped. Not the 10 year aged advertised. Pretty disappointing in taste.;negative
...Very Bad, oily tasteless goop in a jar.;negative
Too bitter.  I was hoping it wouldn't be.  To  me, the Cake Boss are the nicest.;negative
Omg, this was gross.  It had a strange flavor that even by adding salt couldn't mask. I usually like Amy's products but this was horrible.;negative
Flavor is strange, almost like a food flavoring was added. Will not be re-ordering this one.;negative
I tried to eat this could not. So my dogs ate it. Somebody must like it because they still sell it.;negative
Sauce isn't very Italian tasting and tastes like a ton of sugar was added to try to appeal to the kiddies. The ravioli themselves were not as bad.;negative
This product is very difficult to disolve, dissapoinment.;negative
This was shattered in the plastic wrap when I opened the package. No chance Im going to salvage this with possible glass shards in the salt. This is garbage. Very disappointed and no returns accepted.;negative
The taste was spicy strong, probably from vinegar. I made some of my own and liked my coleslaw sauce better, sorry. The numbers are great, but the taste not so great.;negative
Does not have the pumkin spice flavor that i am used to in the coffee shops.  Flavor is not easily detectable.  I had to add cinnamon to make it taste better.  I will not buy again.;negative
I thought this product was paleo friendly, my mistake;negative
It was ok, but it gives me some headache so I don't think I will purchase it again.;negative
Meh. I can get fresher stuff at my local spice shop.;negative
If always wished Nutella tasted like coconut, and was also super runny and binding, then this is for you. I just don't get it. I wanted to love it, hoped I would like it, but really can't stand it.;negative
No sweet flavor at all and slow to dissolve. What is it good for?;negative
"Taste was ok, but no ""bubbles"" (inactive)";negative
The absolute worst ever nuts! If I had to say one thing that struck me about these nuts was they were basically tasteless, I could not say I tasted them.;negative
Complete waste of money.  I must not like roibos tea.  I ended up throwing most of these away.  Some tasted like drinking pot pourri;negative
These don't taste like chocolate nor candy, just... sort of a disgusting chemical-like flavor.  These had been purchased for sundaes but after tasting them they won't be placed anywhere near anything edible.;negative
Super annoyed that it states nowhere on this bag that this product is made from but it is straight up corn.  Ugh.  And of course it is not eligible for return.  Amazon should no longer carry it, boo.;negative
These are very plain with hardly any flavor so you would have to eat with a dip and eat them on the same day you open the package. They will become stale it the box in a couple hours.;negative
I was super stoked about these because I love their cookies. These taste like bad energy bars. Would not recommend. Now I've got a ton of these things that I don't like.;negative
You get very little product for the price.you pay. The taste was okay, but not good enough to make me want to buy this again;negative
overly chewy too much pepper smells great tastes disgusting nasty af don't waste your money;negative
Greasy.  No butter flavor.  Don't waste money.;negative
This is weak even for light roast coffee.  My wife won't even drink it and she'll drink coffees that I find way too weak.  I'd just skip this one.  Dark and Handsome on the other hand is a great MEDIUM roast;negative
Waste of time and money, to complicated.;negative
Pour spout was broken inside box and it had leaked all over everything inside the box!;negative
pretty thin flavor, mostly chemical;negative
very bland, Even canned tomato soup is better.  Very disappointed;negative
I've been an Oolong drinker for years and this does not taste like Oolong at all.  Very little flavor in my opinion, tastes more like a week green tea.  I much prefer the other brands.;negative
Has a strange after taste.  Not happy with product.  I use Stevia in tons of things but this chocolate combination I did not care for.  The price is high also.  Will go back to Hershey's...;negative
doesn't taste great, a bit like medicine.;negative
Not much of a chocolate flavor, but has a low sugar content which I like.;negative
I love this Brand, but I was 3 bottles short and my manager saw it and told me to tell you.;negative
Great product! Price increase from $21 to $29 makes it not worth the price! Will miss the spicy taste.;negative
THIS ITEM COMES PACKED IN SUYBEAN OIL WHICH MADE ME SICK TO MY STAMCH AFTER EATING THEM??????;negative
Better than the day glow red cherries from the grocery store, but for the price, not worth it flavorwise.  Syrup tasted good, but never seems to be well suited for what I am making.;negative
Seems more like a dog treat than beef jerky. Weird smell and odd texture, left a terrible aftertaste. Very fatty as well.;negative
While the flavours were nice, the coffee was much too mild. If you prefer bold or strong coffee, these probably aren't for you.;negative
A clear plastic bag of small broken pieces arrived, not what I expected. Clearly this was substituted.  Not happy.;negative
"I really liked this product the last time I've ordered it but, this time the bag is stamped ""best by 6/18/2014""!! and it was delivered on April 4, 2015. Shame on Amazon and Quaker Oats!";negative
I love both mandarin oranges and grapefruit.  The package I received says that is what I got, but there is no resemblance to mandarin oranges or grapefruit.  I will not be ordering this product again.;negative
didn't like these, and the cup type and over wrap plastic just feels completely useless.  You're better of using a real kcup.  Does't make sense at all and doesn't even taste good.;negative
I had heard good things about the peaberry coffee beans, but when I roasted them, I was disappointed with the outcome compared to other beans.  A bit on the bitter side compared to others.;negative
Apparently has saturated fat which I was not aware of;negative
You delivered White Shoe Peg corn and Mexi-Corn.  I will use it in soup but really wanted Mexi-corn.  Will not be ordering veggies again.;negative
Too light...I can barely taste the tea/honey/lemon favor...like drinking a cup of boiled hot water.;negative
The assortment of herbal teas is very interesting but not all of these teas are tasty.;negative
Tasted Terrible, could not eat this.;negative
Ground is to fine and taste is weak!;negative
"Not my cup of tea. LOL It's a weird combination; just my opinion tho.";negative
This mayo has a cloying taste.  I will just use mustard on my sandwich.  A bad choice for my taste buds.  But you might like it.;negative
Taste worse than dog treats, but smell just like them;negative
"YUCK
I tried for 3 weeks... def needs to be something you grew up with.  Really nasty.  Shame too because I believe the health benefits would be beneficial.";negative
"Not good. Wife says ""tastes like your foot went to sleep"".";negative
Ginger flavor is very weak, I would not recommend or repurchase.;negative
I think only the English can love this!;negative
was not as good as I hoped it would be;negative
Too much of a chemical taste.  I know, it's artificial plavors, but some chips do a better job of tasting less like chemicals ...  this one doesn't.;negative
If you like sweet meat, you might like these but I don't.  I like the barbecue flavor but not so sweet.  Will not use them at all.;negative
These were basically plain wing seperates. Absolutely nothing like the picture.;negative
I didn't like flavor at all. It is very watery and not thick like I expected chocolate to be.. It tastes like watered down cocoa with a strange aftertaste. Not for me!;negative
Some of these are old and coated over with a white powder so it is clear they aren't fresh. A good deal, but look a tad yucky when opening.;negative
Not even close to the original in taste. Only two or three peanuts in each box;negative
awful burnt taste to this coffee - won't be buying this again.;negative
"Its a trick run away!! Warning do not eat more than two or three in a day and damn sure don't eat 2,5 servings bag.

Please relabel as a laxative . its ex-lax in a pretty package.";negative
"This cannot be saffron. https://sybaritica.me/2012/12/24/spice-saffron-and-safflower/
As this clearly explains and the photo clearly shows, this is NOT saffron.";negative
These have far more salt and loose filler than the ones I buy in the local store-supposedly the same Blue Diamond brand.;negative
Meh.  Nothing special.  Certainly NOT like Jet Fuel.  A flat taste and there is just nothing interesting going on here.  Will not buy again.  If you like Folgers, you will probably like this.;negative
Not something I will order again.  It doesn't taste good to me.  When you have to add lots of milk, sweetener and/or flavor to make it palateable -- I won't want to recommend this one.;negative
One Cans top was dented in, Both had about 50% breakage. Its a good thing I crumble my crackers in soup. Its obious very little care was taken to reduce breakage.;negative
wishy washy flavor not for me!  : (;negative
expensive but with little taste, maybe if you like lama coffee this is the one, me I like a stronger taste, will not buy again;negative
I didn't like it. But different people like different tasting coffee. It is a big box, which appealed to me and would be good if I liked it.;negative
dreadful - no one wants something sent from Japan that has melted, then became a horrible melted mess.;negative
i was sent this product as a substitute....I don't like flavoring in my nut milks.  if you like vanilla...go for it but not me.;negative
Has bad taste did not like the way it tasted. Had a funny taste to it.  Will not reorder again;negative
I don't see myself buying this again.  I prefer normal tea already in tea bags.;negative
Bought it based on the great reviews.  Not sure what I'm missing, but it's inedible.  The SweatLeaf is delish and I'll stick with that, thanks.;negative
Does not taste good. Also gave me diarrhea.;negative
Color is not that green, not the one I'm looking for;negative
I think most people like this, but I didn't feel like I was eating cheese.;negative
Was somewhat melted when I received it;negative
Just okay.  The quality was fine but the paper stuck to every candy making it very difficult to enjoy them.  I would not purchase again for that reason.;negative
"I don't know.....
It's my first Xylitol experience.
Maybe it would be okay, if the flavor lasted long enough to taste it.
And if the texture wasn't so rubbery.";negative
the fact this contains .Propylene glycol Is a immediately no go ! Can you belive this contains a chemical that is dangerous for us ?  Make your own by cooking bacon , don't touch this with a ten foot pole !;negative
ordered this honey because of great reviews but gave me stomach pain after taking  Manuka Health MGO 400+ Manuka Honey (20+),...;negative
Icing was more sour than sweet, muffin itself was dry.;negative
We maybe liked 5 out of the 28 flavors, cpl of them were not even drinkable. Will not be purchasing again.;negative
"I about can't drink this stuff. Terrible aftertaste. Plus, it gives me a stomach ache; I guess it's too acidic.";negative
The ingredients are not the same as pictured.  I did not receive bonus chopsticks.;negative
Just put sugar water over your popcorn. Same thing.;negative
"I'm sure these are good vitamins, but they smell very ""vitaminy"" and leave a bad taste :( my son won't eat them at all.";negative
opened the page and the stench was sooo strong, I really almost lost it right there on the kitchen floor.. I could not even come close to eating this... wasted money for me..;negative
Coffee arrived with a hole in the bag.  I attempted to brew some but it tasted stale.;negative
This coffee is quite weak.  I prefer strong, bold, and smooth coffees and this definitely is not one of them.  Yes it is less expensive than other coffees but it is is hardly worth the price.;negative
I can't taste the cardamom at all.  I'm very disappointed.  It might be old or something.  It works ok for a basic teabag.  I'm grinding cardamom spice and adding it to the tea for now.;negative
I order a lot of the Probars and wanted to try these because Amazon suggested them. Other people enjoyed them but I didnt. Just not my thing. I found them to be too salty.;negative
didn't like the taste of the coffee;negative
They were so hard I had to cut with a knife I should have send them back.;negative
Not sure if it was the green beans but the taste just wasn't very good to me.  It kind of reminded me of eating noodles with a seaweed taste.;negative
First, they're more expensive. Second, DESPITE being more expensive, THE PACKAGE IS SMALLER THAN ALL OTHER RAP PROTEIN PACKETS.  Never again.;negative
Unfortunately I couldn't get pass the first tea bag.  It didn't have a taste even with sugar, like my other favorite teas like black tea.;negative
They did not come some of the cans had holes in them;negative
This came and one case had exploded on the rest of the drinks.  It was disgusting.  I will never buy protein drinks through the mail again.  Half of them I ended up throwing away.;negative
expect mostly walnuts and almonds. the costco premium mixed nuts are more money, but have a better variety.;negative
Its too too sweet and taste like plastic.;negative
I love this tea when made with tea bags, but the K-cups are bitter tasting and seem less spiced.  I'll get the tea bags next time.;negative
BEWARE.........THE SOY SAUCE IS GOOD BUT THE PACKING HAS CHANGED IT USE TO COM IN A 5X5 BOX NOW IN A CLEAR PLASTIC BAG IN A SHIPPING BAG UBBY OPENED IT SOY SAUCE EVERYWHERE;negative
Came very underippened and turned way too quickly.;negative
"Okay to bake with but can't use in ice tea or frosting or anything ""white"" because it turns it brown and made tea look ""muddy"". Seemed to need to use more to sweeten.";negative
Makes everything sticky. Would not purchase again.;negative
These were way too dry and crumbly, very disappointed.;negative
Sauce is gross. Rice cake ok. Too expensive.;negative
Never had a Mojito before and didn't know what to expect. Won't be going on a Mojito bender in the foreseeable future. When mixed according to directions the resultant liquid tasted weak.;negative
They never grew past 4 inches.. This was a big disappointment !;negative
I love most spry products as high quality,  natural gums and mints... but this one has artificial flavor :(;negative
"I love dark chocolate but this is just awful. There is no rich dark chocolatey taste at all.

Endangered Species 88% for example is much better.";negative
"They were ok, I still prefer zero brand better- the ""rice"" is a joke, I didn't find funny- a waste of money really.";negative
Love sunbutter....so when we found these sunbutter bars, we were pretty excited. The bars themselves are very small. Takes two to make it a decent snack. They are pretty much too dry.;negative
Was HARD and expired... Dry, yet oily... No bueno;negative
These are tiny weenie cans and way over priced.;negative
Really gross.  I don't know what I was hoping for, but this tastes disgusting. Dogs liked it though.;negative
I'm trying different organic coffees. This was one we didn't care for. So mild we needed 2 cups to get going, or we had to add Starbucks Via to it to give it some flavor.;negative
The licorice under the plain sugar shell is like plastic with no licorice flavor.... i won't be buying it again.;negative
Usually love this candy. Grew  up getting these as a treat when I was younger. The chocolate seems to have been exposed to heat. Had different coloring and tasted different. Won't order again.;negative
Drinkable but I can't get much more enthusiastic than that. It's a bit bitter but not in a good way.;negative
These are marked Vegan but the very last ingredient which is not listed on this product listing is honey which is not vegan.;negative
I must say these candies taste very good, but I cannot eat more than 1 in 24 hours without gas. When I first ate them 6-8 the flatuence was the worse I ever had. So beware all of the chance of intestinal gas.;negative
My palette could not adjust to the flavor. I tried two cups, but it is just not for me. The shipping was wonderful, it arrived on time, just an odd flavor.;negative
We have found Green Mountain's BREAKFAST BLEND to be VERY BLAND.  Timothy's BREAKFAST BLEND is an EXCELLENT alternative.;negative
"Sweet like table sugar, but healthier.
BUT, I Would NOT have bought this product had I realized it was 'Made in China'!";negative
I don't want to call it a bad product, but - bleh.  I'm going to stick with their 100% fruit blends.  This just didn't taste very good.;negative
OMG!  This bread has the texture of sandpaper.  It taste AWFUL!  I will NEVER buy this again!;negative
Sorry to say I was a little disappointed with these.  Some of the rings were just fine, but some of them had a bitter taste.  They also left my mouth feeling greasy.  I will not be ordering them again.;negative
Quantity is great per box but the taste is one that you have to acquire a liking to. I would not order this again.;negative
Only maybe 10 out of the whole bag were coffee.  The rest just tasted like regular peanut.;negative
Product sat on truck too long and was really gummy.;negative
Pricey. I liked it a lot at first, then had cold brew from other places and found that this was not a great purchase, just ok.;negative
Presentation is everything.  Didn't trust the appearance upon delivery.  Returned.;negative
Not great taste. would not buy again.;negative
Tastes terrible---nothing like salt!;negative
Very disappointed when you get something for a gift and it comes damaged;negative
I thought these would taste something like Cheese Its, but they did not taste like that. I did not care for them so I gave them away.;negative
getting far to expensive when there are so many companies manufacturing K cups now.;negative
This has been recalled and the instructions advise NOT to consume them. I bought 3 jars. How do I get a refund?????;negative
Wooo! If you like the hot spicy bite of ginger then this is for you. It wasn't for me (and I do like hot things) but it did mix easily and completely. Perhaps I'll try a different flavor.;negative
Normally  we love these but this order is stale and dry like chalk.;negative
this was very dry, hard and not at all flavorful - would not buy again nor recommend;negative
Where's the cheese flavor? I got it to help replace the cheese in dishes made with cheese, no cheese taste at all. Am i missing something here?;negative
I did not read the specifications on the bottle correctly. I normally get 64 fluid ounces. At 46 Fl Oz, this is not really a bargin;negative
Only if I was on deserted island would I ever try to eat this mystery meat.;negative
It says lime all I taste is sweet and too soft for me;negative
"Was looking forward to some fun coffee flavors, but these don't taste particularly great and i had to put tons in the coffee to taste it.
Did not finish any of the bottles.";negative
They are hard, these were meant for a baby shower. Won't use them now, poor quality;negative
Udis continues to make lackluster tasting gluten free productsl;negative
not good tasting. will not be buying again. Also gave one to my mother and she had same reaction.;negative
Don't bother to order online.  All the lasagna pasta was broken into small pieces.;negative
This was ordered by mistake and I haven't use this blend of spice before.;negative
Not very flavorful and wished it was cold brew instead of room temp.;negative
meh. I think when i tried it at the hairdressers they put a ton of sugar in it, as i cant seem to make it taste as good at home!;negative
I eat White Chocolate Lindt Lindor Truffles all the time.  These chocolates were old or something.  They didn't taste or look right.;negative
It tastes like I'm drinking soap. I've been trying to figure out other things to add to it, to take away this terrible after taste, but I can't. Only buy if you're not attached to your taste buds.;negative
Extremely strong and not pleasant tasting . If i could return it i would for a different flavor;negative
Has a horrible taste.  Through all 100 packages.;negative
Nothing like the banana runts. Doesn't smell, look or taste like banana runts. In fact they smell like chemicals and the taste is repulsive. They r much smaller than the originals. Save your money.;negative
what a tragic mistake it was to order this - the damn nuts are so hard you can break your teeth - BEWARE!;negative
This bread is awful. I can't verify flavor because it is so hard a pit bull's jaw would not be able to bite 'thru.  If you enjoy eating rocks, this is for you.;negative
Would not buy again.  Disappointed in the taste.;negative
Misleading advertising- the photo shows 1.5 pounds and the Description states 1.5 pounds, but the container is only 1 pound. Returning. Not paying $14 a pound for Butter.;negative
This iced tea is terrible. This is the first Stash product that I do not enjoy. It is not iced tea. It tastes more like powdered peppermint leaves.;negative
"Ordered by accident thinking it was a larger quantity.
Not enough to do anything with, and 10x more plastic than basil.";negative
Like many others here my basil arrived wilted.  I'll just be picking it up from the store from now on.;negative
Someone opened and took one of the apple sauce cups.  Sure help yourself to my toddler's snack.  I won't order from here again.  I'm not down with the 5 finger discount.;negative
I wouldn't advise anyone to buy this product. It has a strange color and smell.;negative
Taste really nasty made as a tea.  I ground mine up and made it into pills, but I can only take one at night otherwise it makes my stomach hurt.;negative
Love Egg Nog - this was lacking big time.;negative
I bought this going on product review. I know that everyone's tastes are different, but to me this product tastes like sugar free coffee creamer, not cappuccino. Just my thoughts.;negative
Not the the same flavor cups as shown in the picture.;negative
This honey is always 5 stars, but the top half of the glass jar was broken in pieces upon arrival, so I couldn't get the honey out safely...so sad.;negative
How do you avoid tea that smells like dirty feet??? Is it just me? What will mask the awful taste and smell?;negative
I bought this product and was very unhappy. It tasted nothing like gourmet almond brittle. I took one small bite, spit it out and returned product to Delish for a refund.;negative
I shopped on line and locally for this product.  Surprisingly, I was able to find a much better price locally.  The product is delicious.;negative
The flavors are really bad and not a lot of flavor to be honest.;negative
"I thought this product was from the organic spice company called ""Frontier"".  I was disappointed to find out that it was not.  And it was not GMO free and had a lot of corn in it.";negative
Not that great to be honest with you. Still have some left and I really don't want to eat it.;negative
Good product, and worth cost, but arrived too late.;negative
"I discovered I am allergic to them. It has been hell.
I wish it wasn't like this. I bought too much too.
Sorry.";negative
This was awful! Tastes very gritty and like cardboard. I am not expecting great taste, but this is not palatable at all!;negative
Kinda gross. From the moment I smelled it. Smelled like feet. Which is strange because I've always enjoyed STASH tea.;negative
Didn't care for the texture of these bars.  They are sticky out of the package.  Smaller than I'm looking for too.;negative
Not impressed at all!!  NO FLAVOR!!  Plastic container...;negative
Weirdly dark and moist. Crumbly, not chewy.;negative
The syrups are not suitable for diabetics or keto. My blood glucose doubled after 1 Tbsp. of the syrup. The granulated and gold are fine, but expensive.;negative
If you like little Debie star crunch...the same kinda taste in a bar.;negative
The product is very good. The Amazon packaging is terrible.;negative
THERE WAS NOTHING IN ENGLISH TO TELL YOU WHAT TO DO. THE PRICE WAS HIGH FOR WHAT YOU GOT.;negative
OK, I tried all 4 flavors and none of them taste good.  SOrry Quest, I was really hoping I'd found an alternative to the no longer available Atkin's Chips.  The texture is rough but they are crispy.;negative
"THIS IS A RIP OFF FOR CHUMPS
$8.84 FOR A CAN OF BEANS?
Well, I'm not shopping food on Amazon, there are far too many of these shady deals going on.
Good luck if you want to pay $8.84 for a can of beans.";negative
product listed says it's a 50 count package. I was sent a 10 count package. for 17 dollars, non-refundable, was a total rip-off.;negative
didn't care for them, but the product was fresh.;negative
Was ok! Wouldn't rank it any higher than average grocery store coffee. Pretty weak but smooth. So if you like a mild cup of coffee then try this one. I prefer extremely bold.;negative
Would have been great, if I received chocolate.  However, I received coffee.  Without a change notification.;negative
The item that tastes the least like candy...the Whoppers is the one that takes up half the bag space. Not worth buying again;negative
It was less than I thought it would be.;negative
Drinkable but barely, made 2 pots, gonna toss the rest. On par with Maxwell house;negative
Didnt really do anything for me. I used one bag..didnt reorder.;negative
Roasts weren't dark enough or bold enough, nothing memorable about any of them;negative
I hate it.  I don't like it's taste or any thing about it.  I thought I was buying something else.;negative
Atkinson sugar free bars made me sick, loaded with chemicals and the kind of artificial sweetener that kept  me on the toilet all night plus vomiting. Be careful!;negative
This is the 1st K-cup coffee that I am getting grounds in my coffee. It is occuring about every 3 cups. I have not had this problem with other K cup manufactures. I will not reorder.;negative
This product should not be sold for human consumption.;negative
Ive tried MANY protien powders over the years and this one by far tastes the worst.  Horrible, will throw remaining away.;negative
I thought we had these previously and liked them, but this time they just seem bland and barely taste of cinnamon. We won't be buying these again. :-/;negative
I didn't like these they were to hot for me and didn't have hardly any garlic and dill in them I took out most of the peppers and added lots of garlic and dill.;negative
I'm glad I didn't buy these for their taste.;negative
"used with a hot air popcorn popper.  popcorn was ""chewy"" and not crisp.  disappointed.  haven't tried cooking in oil as directions state yet.";negative
Took forever to ship and they haven't found one that tasted good at all.;negative
TRIED THIS THINKING IT WOULD BE GOOD AS I LIKE OTHER DR MCDOUGALL FOODS. DID NOT CARE FOR THIS AT ALL. MUSHY YET DRY. WONT ORDER AGAIN;negative
Very big disappointment because there is so LITTLE cherry taste. will not be buying  again.;negative
Too small. Not big ones we arw used to;negative
these kcups are weaker than most that I've tried and don't taste like yuban from the can. Very surprised at the good reviews,  maybe they changed the formula;negative
I love anything Dr Pepper but this dessert topping tastes like chemicals not Dr Pepper.  Yuck!;negative
Wish I had read these reviews first. The cookies arrived in a million pieces. The taste is good...you just have to eat them with a spoon.;negative
Not very good at all , very weak and stale taste , not impressed at all with this coffee, disappointed.;negative
Terrible!! DO NOT buy! seller also refused to issue refund!  avoid this selller and this product!;negative
it was too salty for me.  now wondering if they have it in low sodium?  if so, i would go w/ lower sodium.;negative
Not as good as I wanted them to be.  I think they're just a little too soggy for my tastes most of the time.  Ah well.;negative
They were okay, but the peanut butter filling was dry and powdery.;negative
More than half were pouring out coffee grinds;negative
Thse were very close to the expiration date so they weren't very good. I won't buy them again.;negative
Many of the candies  were many damaged and melted ..weather affected  needed or would have sent back..;negative
Not happy with the quality of the seeds. Would not buy again;negative
I ordered these for my daughter, and she wouldn't eat them.  Tasted them and I know why.  They tasted very stale.  Yuck!;negative
Tastes like watered down chocolate....Oh wait, it is!;negative
these taste funky. if you like good coffee, i'd look elsewhere. i just gave my box away;negative
Not nearly up to par.  Very disappointed.;negative
Came with bruises and not ready. This is what it looks like a week later.;negative
yuk, wasn't as pictured, caramel outside strawberry inside, flour taste, not sweet...;negative
They did not seem like they were in that good of a condition when they. More than a dozen of the 48 were broken and had to be thrown away;negative
Good but ridiculously tiny package....so NOT worth he price at all!;negative
Average at best, course ground, takes a lot of coffee to make a good cup. Best to use with a flavored coffee creamer to kill the bitterness;negative
Box arrived partially broken.  Taste is OK.;negative
Although I could not find a sell buy date on these, as they were really stale. A major disappointment since I love these, and they are expensive. I'll just make sure not to use this seller again.;negative
No where near as good as the White Cheddar flavor. Kind of like salty cardboard, really disappointing!;negative
This tea tastes like some tea that had been in the fridge for about a month too long. I did not like it. I like most of the tea that I have bought from tealyra, but not this one.;negative
ALL MY EGGOS WERE CRUSHED AND SO WAS THE BOX;negative
Didn't care for the taste.  Seemed like they were burnt, more than a coffee flavor;negative
I thought I would love this flavor but it is too bitter for me. I'm sticking with my normal Strawberry Kiwi flavor.;negative
Did not like this at all.  I put this on some ribs that smoked for 5 hours.  The rub did not set in good at all.;negative
Old candy.  Would not buy again or recommend;negative
I think these are weak and the flavor is just odd and unpleasant.  NOT warm and spicy pumpkin.  I was terribly disappointed and don't think I'll even finish the box.;negative
The bars taste great but unfortunately one of the packets in the box was mostly empty and had less than half the bar in the wrapper.;negative
not a chemist but it seemed to have a lot of filler.;negative
Very thin, lacks good color or coverage;negative
this has a very strong fake sugar taste - not at all a natural tasting sweetness - no returns are allowed;negative
Too much fiber?  These give me bad gas.;negative
Terrible. Tasted horrible. Yuck!  Threw 8$ away.;negative
The kids loved them, but I did not like the taste.;negative
The initial reviews were SO compelling-  these were horrific.  I gave these out to friends as I could not stomach them-  paste, no taste etc.;negative
I was disappointed in the taste of this sweetener. It certainly has an artifical flavor and aftertaste, and does not leave me satisfied. I've gone back to honey for natural sweetness without the sugar.;negative
This product does not taste anything like butter milk.  It is bland and reminds me of a weak powdered milk.;negative
I don't like to be negative, but these were not good.  I ate one, then threw out the rest -- including the remaining unused mix.;negative
Stale and gross, if the nuts were fresh i am sure 5 stars would be attached.;negative
Some of the most tasteless rye bread I have ever encountered. Brick hard and crumbling as well.;negative
it's just weird. i eat a lot of vegan products and this one is still sitting in the fridge. no one liked it.  i'm not sure why. it wasn't tasty and the texture was off.  and we eat a lot of FAKE meat.;negative
Even though the product was in date, it was very dry and tasteless.  Perhaps a storage issue before shipping or a product that came from the manufacturer this way?;negative
Was super excited when this came up while looking for paleo options- only to find out it contained refined sugar. My fault for missing it before ordering.;negative
taste was good but it has whey in it and I have an allergy to it;negative
Listed as 'calendula flowers' but the tea bags only contain powder- looks like dust. I was hoping for at least a few petals but there are none. Has very little taste...returned.;negative
Flavor does not last over two minutes, but if you want to chew on gum after;negative
Weird texture.  Funky flavor. Kids hate and so do parents. Went straight into trash can.  Waste of money.  Might have been good for us but will never know.;negative
It is very spicy. Way more than I expected. And it sticks to your teeth. I only took a couple of bites and put it away. I wouldn't buy it again.;negative
I searched for drink mix with Splenda.  This was sweetened with Aspartame, a poison for your body according to research I have done on artificial sweetners.  I threw the product away;negative
These things stink and taste horrible. I bought the BBQ flavor. They are horrible. The rest are going in the trash.;negative
The taste is awful and I won't buy it again.  I have been serving it to a woman from Mexico and she likes it.;negative
It will expire in less than 2 months. Sad!;negative
It tasted like sweet and sour jerky. Not a fun mix in my opinion.;negative
We purchased this for a jungle theme party. These things are absolutely disgusting. They are very chewy and gross.  I hope no guests noticed!;negative
You know, since I started getting salted cashews at the health store (organic) I cant even eat these anymore - they have no taste and there are too many bad or crunchy pieces;negative
The bears were very hard and the packaging was very thin. All of the bags were ripped when they arrived.;negative
I was hoping this version would be better....but although less salty...still lacking in texture and taste;negative
I'm not throwing it out, but wouldn't buy again either. I don't know if it's just stale, but you open a bag and - nothing, no aroma. Ok with cream, I guess.;negative
NO INGREDIENTS, JUST AIR. DISCUSSING BRITISH AIR, WE HAVE OUR OWN DISCUSTING AIR, WHO NEEDS THIERS.;negative
Too sweet, not enough protein and hurt my teeth with bone fragments. Nice packaging though.;negative
"Both my husband and I found the taste of this coffee to be unpleasant, with a ""muddy"" aftertaste.  We are accustomed to drinking coffees from all over the world, but would not buy this one again.";negative
This tea is not sweet, at all. It's got a terrible aftertaste. I make it with lots of sugar, just like a would Lipton Tea. I won't be buying this again.;negative
These are really great when they're fresh.  These seemed stale and really dried out even though they were no where near expired.  Cancelled my subscription after the first order.;negative
More sugary not as much maple taste;negative
These never work for me.  They either leak grounds into your coffee, or you can't get it strong enough.  I'll just keep buying K-cups I guess.;negative
My children didn't enjoy the taste. They love cheese puffs but did not want to eat these. Won't be buying again.;negative
"This blend is somewhat disappointing.  The Kona is indistinguishable.

Where did all of the high-quality Kona blends go?  This isn't one of them.";negative
"Needs more pistachio's & less ""Mix"".  Too many almonds & dark nuts that looked burnt or old or unidentifiable.";negative
These are good but half of them molded in a very short time.;negative
Pretty rough on the palette. The flavor is terrific.;negative
Buyer Beware! I thought this was for 12 bags because it was so expensive but I paid all that money for one tiny little bag!;negative
Didnt care for the taste, but everyone is different;negative
"Make sure you know that this contains ""Jalapeno's"" so it's hot";negative
Doesn't taste like blueberry. Just plain green tea. I have had way better flavored teas. This one is pretty blah.;negative
Unfortunately more than half the box was rejected by our Keurig machine.  Apparently the pods do not have the K with dots, i.e. the new design for these machines and had to be thrown away unused.;negative
Mainly stems, unfortunately, and not very fragrant-- there is a good amount in the package, but check out the other brands. I am hooked on Greek mountain tea as a soothing cure-all.;negative
Flavor was not strong enough for the coffee;negative
Tastes like the coffee sold in vending machines. It's very sweet but the coffee is too weak. One can make it palatable by adding a spoonful of instant coffee.;negative
"I am big fan of marshmallow; but I did not like this. It has a funny taster. Hopefully, I can find someone to give this to. I will not get this again.";negative
I used it to write on white chocolate and it looks like crayon. It isn't very liquidy. You have to go over your writing many times causing it to look sloppy. I won't buy them again.;negative
"this stuff isn't worth the plastic jar it came in and it is ""non-returnable."" don't go cheapo on royal jelly";negative
Almost tasteless, not much bulk to it.;negative
Nasty. The cherry-chocolate flavor are so good and I love banana bread, so I had to try these. Yuck. Gummy, gluey, just disgusting.;negative
good flavor, but parts of it are so fine that they leak out of the mesh tea ball and into the cup or teapot.;negative
These are still in the cupboard,  Absolutely awful taste.  Can not get anyone to eat them.  Yuck.  Probably should just throw them away but don't want to be out the money.;negative
Takes more than double the amount of drops to create a deep green. They need to improve the formula so it saturates liquids better.;negative
Blue Apron sent 2 of these bars as samples and they were delicious.  I ordered a box off of amazon and the ones that came were so stale they hurt my teeth to chew them!;negative
This Erythritol has no flavor.  Dipped my finger in it and compared to swerve.....NO comparison. This one had no sweetness at all. Cookies tasted like flour...;negative
"beans were much smaller in size than previous order!
some what disapointed.....";negative
The chocolate was great, but I was giving these as gifts and 1 was unwrapped in the box so not usable.;negative
If you think this is going to be like those beautiful containers of fresh cut fruit at Whole Foods, it aint. We tossed it out after a couple bites.;negative
"I've waited weeks, spraying and praying, finally I lifted the flower, it was dead, the branches had no roots. I felt like a fool waiting for this to take off.
Very disappointed...";negative
SENSEO Pods all leaking coffee in both bags I bought. I won't purchase it again;negative
Quick delivery but tasted burnt.  Will not reorder.;negative
Great product for your health in so many ways.;negative
This product was never received.. It was cancelled.;negative
I didn't realize just how tiny this package was.;negative
Really really poor quality- gave off BLACK DYE when washed and cooked!;negative
Not hot at all . Put 3 in a salsa barely spicy. I even used the rehydration method . Not worth the cost;negative
Many cookies were very fragmented. (broken into bits);negative
These nuts have an off taste. They are stale and a huge disappointment. Will not buy again.;negative
The taste is bad. It does not work for me.;negative
this tea is poor.  I had to return it.  No flavor at all.;negative
Seems more bitter...not as good to me as Prince of Peace brand which I cannot find anymore. I'm giving this away.;negative
Overall I'm not a fan, I wanted to like it but the dominant flavor was sugar not chocolate.;negative
very disappointed in the actual amount that was in the can, only just over half filled thus making the deception of a larger volume as the can was much to big for the actual content;negative
Horrible, moldy taste. It made me sick.;negative
normally these things are great, but they came really stale.  Disappointed.;negative
Not a great flavor.  I'm spoiled by nutella.;negative
They died I follow the instructions;negative
Inedible. Rancid and smells like fish. Ugh;negative
I have found some bad tasting nuts in the cans. Not sure why this would happen as I have bought Planters all my life. Not sure I will be ordering again anytime soon;negative
Loses flavor, flavor is good but it's gone in 5 minutes. Sad, I wanted this to be great;negative
save your money i liked the taste of the noodles but the seasoning was not very good.not worth 3.20 a serving;negative
My son didn't like the taste of these and refused to drink them :( I got the vanilla flavor.;negative
really wanted the coffee taffy espresso  disappointed;negative
Not good qualitie it's not to green it's brown;negative
Not as good as the old Spicy with the seafood, I had this on subscribe and save but received an email saying the product changed to Beef and Picante. I do not like the new packaging or the new flavor :(;negative
Not enough taste for me!  One of the pods had an unseen cut in the pod!  Coffee beans all through the drink and lodged in between teeth!  Horrifying !!!!;negative
I used to buy this flour for awhile, but my son who is gluten intolerant thought it was too grainy.  My daughter had the same comment.  I switch to another brand and haven't gone back.;negative
tasted like rancid oil, tossed the lot as it was inedible.;negative
Doesn't have guar gum, but it separates into a lumpy consistence that is not palatable.  I was making coconut kefir and this product did not ferment very well.;negative
It was bland. It was at the 'best by' date, maybe some of the flavors depreciated/broke down.;negative
This maybe all natural but they taste awful. I tried one so I could not return them for a refund. I could not give the rest away no matter how hard I tried;negative
I get no energy boost from these at all .;negative
This syrup tastes nothing like pumpkin pie.  I can't taste the spices at all.  Very disappointed.;negative
Tastes like dirty water. I had to double the amount just so it didn't taste like water. Expensive. Try Teeccino Mediterranean Java Herbal Coffee Alternative. I did and I loved it.;negative
Till I got it, I did not realize that they shrunk the size. hate it. will look for alternatives.;negative
Not what I was hoping for in this gluten free household. Hard to incorporate in recipes (even ones that call for such an ingredient) and tastes awful.;negative
Has a weird aftertaste. Just like the beef, you have to use half the jar to get any sort of flavor out of your dish. I will use it up but I will not purchase this product again.;negative
way to expensive for what it is as it turns out its as filling as one pancake with high calories;negative
The lid seems to leak...not where it comes out of the top but at the base of the cap. Disappointed because no matter what I try a lot of product leaked out.;negative
Not my fave. I like a smooth, well balanced flavor. This isn't it. Lyons Gold Blend is my cup of tea...;negative
Package cannot be resealed. The apricots are very dry when compared to the other ones I've purchased from Amazon. Will not buy again.;negative
Do not like Cake Boss coffees. their flavors are not really what they say they are.;negative
Tough to explain. I think the foil cover isn't working too well. The first couple of cans were great, the other two - just off. The third - still in pantry.;negative
Absolutely like a pecan cake with fruit. Pecans were wonderful and definitely the focus of the cake. Add 2 stars if you like pecans.;negative
I've tried 3 different kinds of go lightly candy, none of the are edible.;negative
I expected this to taste like a floral white tea. It's just terribly bitter.;negative
These taste weird, won't stick to popcorn even popped in oil, and end up in a gloppy mess in the bottom of the container.  Enough said.;negative
left a floral taste lingering.  The coconut is fantastic but mix the lime with the coconut feels like I gotta call the doctor to relieve my belly ache.  But seriously it just does not taste good.;negative
disappointing. Hard to measure. Cap did not fit correctly causing spillage. Flavor is very weak on some flavors.;negative
"I wanted to try something new this time, and unfortunately this was a mistake.
It's tastes like soap, it is impossible to eat this... No, it does not tastes like honey, it will give you aftertaste of soap.";negative
An acquired taste. They had a bitter taste to them and could not return them. So make sure you are ok with fear factoring it down.;negative
many figs in the bag looked so old and so dry :(;negative
This tastes NOTHING like the other packets of maple and brown sugar. These are disgusting.;negative
I thought this would have a real apple-y flavor like cider, but it is really bland. Not my cup of tea I guess...couldn't resist the pun;negative
Disgusting. Just the worst coffee I've ever tried. Not sure if something's wrong with the bag I got but it doesn't even smell like ground coffee, it smells bitter and unpleasant. Tastes even worse.;negative
Tastes terrible, except in yogurt...;negative
Tastes great. To bad I never got my second bottle ordered.;negative
This coffee tastes awful.  Bitter and cheap tasting.  Will not buy or recommend to anyone else. I hate to leave such a bad review, but it is really nasty.;negative
I must be doing something wrong, I don't like it, tastes very artificial to me.  I would suggest Pappys sassafras concentrate over this.;negative
Had some great dried peaches from a store and ordered these based on that experience....I did not like.;negative
I thought it was good, but my husband didn't really like it.;negative
"Buyers you should know that the top ingredient in this product is water; the second is alcohol.  The coconut flavor is weak.";negative
These are really stale. Not very tasty either.;negative
Too soft!  I buy raw cashews locally and they are still crisp. These were so soft I had to roast them to make them edible.;negative
Wasn't a big fan of this at all. Just didn't have a great taste;negative
not what I thought it was . its a soup base and I wanted bacon grease ,drippings to fry stuff nin.;negative
Perhaps the Dark Chocolate Hot Cocoa is great, but I didn't order the product.  I ordered the Chocolate Mocha, but received the other.;negative
My taste buds are not very partcular & are refusing to have any more of this product.  A dog might be interested.;negative
"Product claims to be low in sodium.  Check the nutritional info provided.  Note that ""serving"" is NOT the whole container (which is small at that).";negative
Vanilla taste horrible.  Chocolate great.;negative
Not what I expected I prefer real deer jerky not this city boy bulls***;negative
If you can get the cherry berry package, go there. This mixed bunch has some odd tasting (to my taste) varities which I avoid. But it's the same brand, hazer baba.;negative
We couldn't finish even one of these bars. They tasted terrible! We threw them all out.;negative
Hard noodles and dishwater tasting broth make these inedible....ones in grocery store taste much better!;negative
The flavor of the old Beer Nuts is almost entirely gone. The Beer Nuts are now just plain Spanish Peanuts with a slight flavor, hardly noticeable. Extremely disappointing.;negative
I can't review the actual product because they arrived all melted together into one large glob, literally. Had to return. They look yummy in the photo, though...;negative
Terrible flavor. Does not compare to hominy grits. Grainy, hard texture even with extended microwave cooking. Also, contains soy. Why add soy to grits? Discarded the whole batch.;negative
Impossible to open. Had to break the cover..;negative
Didn't care for anything about this product;negative
I love the calorie and low-glycemic features, but this stuff isn't very sweet and has a powdery texture that I'm not crazy about. Love the idea, but it didn't work so well for me.;negative
Pretty close to originals-too much sugar in this one;negative
This blueberry is very murky tasting. I love blueberry flavoring, but not this one.;negative
"Amazon's price is terrible on this product, especially as a bulk boxed item.  This jerky is tougher than average, but has better than average flavor.  Lower carbs than other brand's ""regular flavor"".";negative
Basically just sugar water w flavoring. I usually read ingredients B4 buying. Apparently I did not this time. :(;negative
I got a bag of Rancid seeds you can't add enough flavoring to cover the taste wasted a whole big bowl of good Ice Cream will not buy again.;negative
This coconut sugar is more like a flour. Terrible consistency for oatmeal;negative
Darn, kids do not like them.  Refuse to eat even one bag worth... they LOVE the cinnamon Fuji Apple's.;negative
This was supposed to make whipped cream, it has 13 grams of fat but would not whip. Huge letdown!;negative
When these arrived, they were so stale and rock-hard I couldn't eat them. What a waste.;negative
I get it but these really don't taste that good. Gluten is really needed for some dishes to be worth calling food.;negative
some of the worst coffee I have ever tasted;negative
These were mushy and soggy and not worth the money;negative
"Not a true licorice taste, very bland. Was expecting true licorice this product taste artificial. I wouldn't recommend.
I will not reorder.
Don't waste your money.";negative
I HATE this .. I give it no stars - wish that was an option;negative
did not like it, taste funny. I like reg. tea so it  had to go with the other teas, gave it away;negative
They were good but came with over 6 broken.  also they are way over priced.  You can get 8 for just 1.00 at Cracker Barrell.;negative
Ordered 40x1.1oz and received 12x5oz box. See photo.;negative
"This ""juice"" almost takes like a soda.  Syrupy with no pulp, artificially sweetened perhaps, just not tasty or refreshing at all.";negative
Maybe it's just luck of the draw but I found this coffee stale and as bland as Folger's from an old opened can.  Never again for me.;negative
Not gluten free. Contains msg. While it tasted delicious it caused tremendous gastro upset due to my gluten intolerance;negative
"In spite of coming up when searching for K-cups, these are not.  They are some sort of odd filter-pack.
They are even boxed exactly like most K-cups.";negative
Not ready to eat, and you pay more for this???;negative
These things are more like cotton candy than anything else.  Perhaps I should have read the product description more closely.;negative
I already rated this is having been terribly overpriced;negative
Didn't like the taste, but it could just be my particular taste.;negative
The seeds I received or old and off flavored.  I'll purchase from the local indian market to ensure quality next time.;negative
The Loaded flavor tastes just salty to me, no bacon flavor, etc.  Very salty. The buttery one is better.;negative
No real taste. It's like a sugar flavored gum drop. People who state they have different flavors must be imagining things. For the cost I should taste more than sugar;negative
"Kind of reminds me of powdered soy milk.... ""hurricane milk"" from when I was young. It's too sweet and kind of watery. I wouldn't buy it again.";negative
This was so dry that I couldn't hardly swallow it. It was bland - just almonds. But it's just a personal preference. I gave them to two of my friends, and they liked them.;negative
Won't recommend these. The quality and taste are poor. I will not purchase this item again. Don't like the brand.;negative
This gluten free variety left me feeling just as nauseated as regular oatment....way too sweet.;negative
Definitely not the same as lucky charms....;negative
This is not the sourwood honey I ate as a child. It tasted more like a bland sugar syrup. It didn't even taste like honey. I was excited to find this product, but disappointed in the taste, or lack there of.;negative
I've had outstanding sunflower seed bread at a gourmet restaurant, had hoped this would be similar.  Not so!  I threw the first pack away, now wondering who wants to buy the other unopened three!!!;negative
"I don't know what it is about these things but they dry out my throat and make me cough.

I won't be buying these again.";negative
I love chickpeas and I love Indian food. I don't understand the high ratings here. I was expecting a much better product. Flavor is not good, and is EXTREMELY strong and overpowering.;negative
"These are so expensive it is so much ""cheaper to buy in any store ! Itz's are just as good and so much cheaper !";negative
unfortunately the harney and sons teas have a little too much going on for me.;negative
love the chips when they are chips...not chip dust;negative
One inch square crackers were damp, not crispy, like they had been processed in a very humid climate, or sealed while hot, causing condensation.;negative
Did not realize this was made from the hide. I wanted it made from the bone. This stuff tastes so badly bitter. Expensive waste of money.;negative
I paid too much for this coconut/pineapple water. It tastes really yukky! Prefer the plain coconut water.;negative
Dark, lacks nuance, almost muddy taste, and has a bit of a bite. Not the pristine bold of espresso, but dense and heavy on the tongue.;negative
To me this was very poor quality licorice allsorts candy.  For me it was much to sweet.  The coconut was nut even real..  I will continue to buy Bassetts;negative
It's healthy, but at what a price. Dry. I didn't think it was tasty at all. Not a winner in my opinion;negative
Sorry,Splenda is the only one the diabetic association approves.;negative
Too dry if eaten without some kind of drink.;negative
No natural sweetness. San Marzano are much better.;negative
annie chun is horrible, noodles are the same no matter what dish you get and ....seasonsing are weak... she's terrible.;negative
"Should be named ""shredded kind of light tuna"" which tastes ok, i.e. nothing special.  Not as good as I had been getting in my local groceries.";negative
Deceiving nutrition facts label, see the picture of the real label. Nothing wrong with the seeds, will keep the 2 bags I ordered but will not buy again.;negative
While it tastes pretty good, it's pretty high in carbs.  Misleading because they just made the serving size smaller than other mixes!;negative
"In really didn't like the Blueberry Green Tea because it had no flavor.  I had to add another tea to it to
give it a taste.  I really would not buy it again.";negative
This product has sand or grit in it and is unusable. I simply do not understand the favorable reviews on this product.;negative
Does not taste good...very disappointed.  Waste of money, not sure what I am going to do with it.;negative
Received a box of Alfredo Sauce mix NOT Taco Seasoning mix;negative
loose cap, a very messy problem, the seller must have known since the bottle was in a plastic bag with a twist tie.;negative
Should have been forewarned that this product doesn't work properly with Keurig II coffeemaker.;negative
This came so dried up in the bottle, I couldn't even dig it out with a spoon. Must have been on the shelf 30 years or so. Disappointed.;negative
"Very thick oil turned out to be a combination of olive and SOYBEAN. From the taste and consistency, there is more soybean than olive.
I am sorry I purchased a quantity.
Progresso is much better.";negative
Not much of a ginger taste to this tea, and it's a VERY weak tea blend. If you want a better peach and ginger blend of black tea, I would go with Republic of Tea instead.;negative
I liked nothing about this. Purified water, distilled water, spring water all taste better than this coconut water.;negative
CANDY IS HARD AND WRAPPER IS STUCK ON GINGER CANDY;negative
Stale, Stale, Stale.  Thank goodness, Amazon picked up the tab.;negative
hate the middle creamy centers, yuck. need a better picture so you see what you will be getting. plain carmel from now on.;negative
I thought these would be the chocolate, nuts and fruit variety.  NOT at all fond of these bird seed variety packs!  Dissappointed...;negative
Nice large well formed pieces, but very STALE.  I will look elsewhere;negative
I like products from Bakery on Main, but this was just too sweet for my tastes.;negative
I returned these. I did not like the taste combination;negative
"I was disappointed in this spice blend; it did not go well with the foods I wanted to use it on.";negative
the recipient loved it and that makes for a happy customer.  Thanks.;negative
Makes an bland cake but the cookies are awful. Using package instructions the cookies are pale, bland and taste mostly like flour;negative
Great taste and texture, but small amount, Yellow dye, and very high price mean this is not a repeat buy for this popcorn loving family. No way.;negative
I liked ginger cookies but these cookies had bad texture and not enough peanut butter flavor;negative
NOT dark chocolate...just flavored that way. my boys like it and I want them to prefer dark chocolate over milk chocolate but dissapointed there isn't more real cacao in this.;negative
I have only tried this tea once and I didn't like it, however, I will try it again and write more.;negative
tastes like cough syrup, even after using less than the required amount.  sorry soda stream, this one is no good.;negative
I did not like the after taste. The product itself was good just could not enjoy the after taste  I like the ones with Xylitol better.;negative
very weak orange flavor, nothing like the lemon. I won't buy again.;negative
"What was neglected to be mentioned is that this product was ""made in a facility that also produces milk, soy, wheat, fish and egg"".  Beyond that it is very bland.  Not pleasant to my palate.";negative
I'm sure this is a good product...I just don't like the taste.;negative
Not big on the fish smell, I read that it comes from the type of bacteria present during the long aging cycle.  I have had other Pu-erh and it had no where near the strengh of this brand.;negative
taste is off, and it's so runny, so many of these are soooo runny, guess I will stick with regular PB;negative
Sorry.  Very fresh, but too thin so they had a styrofoam texture.  I much prefer other brands I have sampled.;negative
I did not like these at all. They tasted burnt or something.;negative
This product is on the stale side i am sorry to say!;negative
same brand sold at the local store tasted better for some reason.;negative
I received three of these k-cups in a variety pack. I think Folgers tastes better, and I hate Folgers. If you want good coffee, stay clear of this.;negative
There was no flavor of coffee despite putting the first cup of coffee through the pod twice - still no flavor of coffee. I'll never purchase this coffee (?) again!;negative
After eating about six pieces it made me sick, candy tasted horrible. Will never order this stuff again. Very disgusting.;negative
Not worth it I can buy the big bags at Costco for 5.99;negative
"I don't care if Dr Oz recommends this! The taste and texture of this ""oil"" is terrible. I cannot find a use for it. I would not recommends this overpriced item to anyone.";negative
Chalky, does not readily dissolve in water, and a foul taste.;negative
I agree with the person that said these tasted rancid .......revved this month and expired in April.;negative
Just okay.  It had a faint flavor but left a bitter aftertaste.;negative
You may like it fine. I just didn't like the taste and I wanted it to replace coffee.. you may like the flavor I didn't.;negative
The protein drink itself is good.  However, the container is horrible.  I had this on subscribe and save.  The last case had several items that burst in transit and leaked all over.  I won't purchase again.;negative
Tastey but I get a better value (1/2 price) at my bulk food store.;negative
This is the worst tasting bottle....I've ever had leaves my mouth very dry.;negative
They taste Disgusting! They look nothing like the photo! You can't see what you're eating. No nuts or oats to be seen. It's color is like p**p!;negative
Not a bad blend but hold a candle to real Kona beans. If you want to experience real Kona coffee, save your money and buy the real thing, not this blend.;negative
Product is from China.  Country of origin is not disclosed in the product description.  Will not purchase again.;negative
This is WAY too small for almost $30 dollars. Tastes good though I am not sure how it helping me yet. This needs to either be bigger or a lot less expensive!;negative
It takes so much of the liquid to even add a tiny bit of sweetness it really isn't worth it.;negative
These nuts are tasteless and hard. I regret buying them. I've purchased many things from Amazon and have been happy with most of it but was very disappointed with these peanuts.;negative
"not another date sweetened ""health"" bar.the flavors sound so good but they all taste like DATES. horribly sweet.how about some other natural sweetener-or am I the only one complaining?";negative
"This product says it is light agave and the picture shows light agave.  The actual product sent to me is NOT light agave; it is very dark!!!!!!!!!!!";negative
Not to great tasting and does not have good chewing texture;negative
It was too pricey for the amount that came.  It's OK, but will not buy again.;negative
Had to ask for a replacement because the seal was barely on let alone adhered. Second one was worse with blue icing leaking inside the plastic outer bag. Didn't even bother to ask again.;negative
Overpriced and not that spectacular.;negative
Product arrived in good order and when expected, but i don't care for the flavor.  Not enough lemonaide flavor for a half and half tea.  The green tea flavor over powers the drink.;negative
These are in water.  I like the ones in oil better.;negative
These are not sour on any level.  Why they are called 'Sour' balls is baffling to me.  They are sweet.;negative
Somehow it does not taste the same as what I ate in Japan.  It could be freshness.;negative
"This product  has nothing going for it - no taste, no real sweetness - nothing.
Perhaps they could consider adding some flavoring to them - maybe lemon or raspberry?";negative
USDA organic, but made in China. Tell me how that works exactly?;negative
Very disappointed in these almonds. There was a very odd aftertaste and too costly.;negative
Once I poured it out of the package to make and just could not do it.  Yuck!;negative
Seems like they found it, dehydrated it, put it in a container, and shipped it. I don't like the soup flavor.  More hot versus an actual flavor.  Threw away what I had left after eating a few.;negative
Poor quality but ok taste. Pretty dark matcha even for culinary grade. Too bitter for my taste. Using Do matcha now and happy. This was just too bitter and dark for me. Dark means less good stuff.;negative
Didn't care for the taste, more bitter almonds then others I've bought!;negative
like the lime and lemon flavor, just personal taste.;negative
Weird aftertaste, not for us. I guess some people have different reactions to different sweeteners, and we obviously can't handle Stevia.  We prefer the Mio varieties -;negative
This does not taste like Jamaican me crazy. It is bitter and not smooth and rich. The box is not far from being expired. This is mid may and both boxes expire July 15 2015.;negative
These little balls of yuck are pretty but that's about it.  The taste wears off in seconds.  The gum gets super hard.  Get something else.;negative
Not authentic taste. OK for Campbell's but not to a Thai ester like me. Sorry.;negative
"Surprised by all of these great reviews!
Aw, besides being ""farmed"" it has a foul odor,
One tiny taste, same opinion, FOUL I put it in a baggie and threw it away . . .";negative
I would NOT buy this again. It was NASTY! I ordered the peppered, but has not arrived yet. I'll probably refuse it because the ORIGINAL was so bad, I doubt the PEPPERED is any better.;negative
This product is very good, I just found with the size of this bag, after a while you get a little sick of the pretzels;negative
Was made by Hershey who riuns the taste of these eggs the chocolate is awful!;negative
Doesn't grind well in a standard salt grinder.  It also is a bit on the moist side.;negative
Wasn't very good. Tasted like strawberry, but was really messy to make.;negative
Horrible.. it does n't taste good. i have tried medium roast it was better. this one has no flavor. waste of money.;negative
These things stinks shortly after opening.  I not only had to throw out 75% of the bag, I had also to deal with the after taste and memory of it which made me nauseous weeks after the last bite.;negative
I assume this is what vegemite is supposed to taste like but I still hated it;negative
You know what?  The cookie is the best part.  Not the cream.;negative
Very watery and not a nice thick syrup like other sugar-free brands. Not a very strong raspberry flavor.;negative
nothing but crumbs once they arrived;negative
"Doesn't taste as good as the canned stuff.  I wonder why... maybe cause it's microwaved instead of heated up on the stove.
The potatoes taste old, like dry crumbly grossness.  YUCK. Never buying this again.";negative
"WASTE  of  MONEY.  Berry  taste  undetectable.  ALLERGIC  lemon  mixture.  DONOT  BUY  this  product.

Tried  using  less  and  adding  small amount  to plain  tea.  UNUSABLE!";negative
These are disgusting. Trader Joe's bean and cheese burritos are a hundred times better. These have the cheapest possible ingredients.;negative
Disappointed.  Flavors were not what I expected.  Will not order it again.;negative
I think these ginger candies are too hot and I can't even taste or smell ginger on them.  Maybe I got a bad batch.  I might use them for tea but I really wanted a portable source of ginger.;negative
I do not like the taste or consistency.;negative
The whole pack was melted when I received it.;negative
I thought this would be more fruity and less spicy.  This was very spicy.  I couldn't taste any of the plum.;negative
I was disappointed. Has a strange taste. Just okay.;negative
YUK!!!!!!!!!! the coffees were all sour and old again YUK;negative
Doesn't taste like butter at all. Had to put tons of salt on it. Now I have a ton of the stuff. Ugh.;negative
very plastic taste - awful and I SELDOM write a poor review;negative
Package well. Arrived with all the chesses melted and slimy. Hoped for better. Couldn't eat . Everything else was great.;negative
Enjoyed the delicious flavor but...for the price, 10 cookies would sell more of this product;negative
I bought this product because everybody rated 5 star.  Mybe my tast is gone, but I use three of them and throw the other in thr trash.  Worst gravy, no favor.;negative
did not like it..  should have ordered corn beef;negative
Smell awful bad of fish!!!!!  Yucky!;negative
I got these cause of the reviews,these are not cinnamon enough for me,just okay. But great for gifts for halloween.;negative
This coffee was just okay. Would not buy again. Can't really taste a flavor and it's definitely a light coffee.;negative
Although Equal Sweetner Powder packets have been a favorite for years,  Equal Sweetner Tablets will not be. Equal Sweetner Tablets left the artificial sweetener aftertaste of yesteryear in the mouth.;negative
Sorry not a fan. I've been using Matcha now for over a year and I don't feel that is quality product.  I should of known, you get what you pay for.  Sorry it not as glorious as it sounds;negative
Not enough cinnamon.  When I tasted this I realized that I could easily make this myself;negative
They rot fast, I'm trying a different option;negative
this was a disgusting soup to spiced.still crunchy after cooked.and i really like canned pea soup with ham from campbells.;negative
I like green tea and have tried other brands of green tea K-cups, so I thought I would give Twinings a shot. It was very bitter. I didn't care for it at all.;negative
Wow, this has to be the worst coffee in a K cup that I have ever experienced.  It's stale and tasteless, I don't understand why there are positive reviews regarding this coffee!;negative
Way too salty. It's like tough, chewy hamburger rolled in salt. Not easy to choke down even if you're hungry. Felt sick to my stomach for hours after eating this.;negative
rock hard as a brick. stale. very disappointed.;negative
The taste is not good this time and product from china;negative
My husband ordered these and they are gross.  It's been months and we still haven't finished them because we don't like them very much.  Nissin brand tastes much better.;negative
Tasted stale and did not have an expiration date on it.  I returned it immediately at a local UPS station.;negative
I shouldn't have got them. It's like diabetes in a container. I ate a couple, got really high on sugar and then tossed them.;negative
Very disappointed. Makes lightly chocolate flavored water, barely.;negative
I purchased this in Amazon's warehouse and it arrived as a sticky mess. Not recommended. :(;negative
Too much sugar for me, very gritty also.;negative
"Too artificial
Use peppermint oil instead";negative
The description specifically says CANS.  I did not want cardboard boxes.;negative
They were hard and taste different than the small packs.;negative
Horrible, artificial flavor!!  I threw the entire box away--it wasn't worth my time to send it back.;negative
"9 oz is the size they might have hanging at a gas station for a couple bucks. Not huge, but bigger than the vending machine ""regular'' size.

Two stars for green apple, bring back lime.";negative
very disappointed, not good for backing at all, not much flavor, might be ok to add to water or something like that but not added to foods or baking.;negative
Its ok! the true lemon its self is fine to add to your water but the drink mixes tastes horrible!;negative
Ugh. Tried this because I love their monk fruit sweetener. This stuff is terrible. Note that it contains stevia.;negative
Best by date on package is 10 days after I received package. It is in my opinion dishonest for someone to sell something that is 10 days from being too old.;negative
Didn't have a safety seal, had to return.;negative
The tea crystals, when put in hot water, smell amazing.  If only the tea tasted as good...UGH, it is so bitter that even with a tablespoon of honey it is not palatable.  Very disappointed!;negative
Nice fish oil taste I didn't expect. Seems like they are, like most producers of food from the past, changing and skimping on the recipe. I could be wrong, my taste buds could be 90% fish...?;negative
"This is the most horrible GF Flour I have ever tasted - I have been GF for 12 years.
When compared to Namaste GF Flour the Premium GF Cake Flour isn't even in the running.";negative
"This ""food"" is not healthy for known life forms.";negative
Lack firmness or significant flavor;negative
The box arrived open and one of the flaps was torn off.;negative
I rarely will ever write a review... although the taste isn't bad, the sugar alcohol will give you the runs, not worth it..;negative
Not up to the standarss of Godiva.  Very disappointing stick to the ice cream parlor truffles;negative
"I grew up with Slim Jims as a snack, now I have to take out a mortgage to buy some.
Just way to expensive, and unhealthy :((";negative
It tastes pretty good.  Like the others have said it has a grassy taste.  It did not help my blood sugar and it gave me a lot of gas.;negative
"Chalky tasting, way way way over priced and box size is deceptive;  it is a standard macaroni box but only half full.";negative
Would rather have regular cheese - this is ok in a pinch but not a big fan.  JM;negative
Not sure how the heck these have such high reviews. Super salty!! I bought them for my work team and no one would eat them. Ended up throwing them all away.;negative
This kale Krunch was very distasteful and unappetizing.  It had a bitter flavor and all the kale chips were smashed!  So, it was a bag of herbs!  I don't recommend this.;negative
Not particularly a fan of crazy ups.  Flavors were unimpressive.  Coffee was subpar.  I could do without ever ordering them again.  There are better samplers and better coffees.;negative
"For the price they are not worth it.  The taste was very unpleasant.  I would not buy them again. The price is too high for such
a little bag.";negative
Pricey for the size of container (small);negative
I thought these were going to have a rich chocolate taste. Very cheap tasting.... I read the label and it is a Hershey product, no wonder;negative
product was not fresh, and was repackaged.;negative
I usually like these fine grind Cuban style coffees for making cold-brewed coffee. But this one just came out pretty bitter even with cold brewing. Think I'll stick to the Cafe Bustelo for that.;neutral
If you like dark roast it's good.  Not the coffee that I remember. Probably will not purchase again. It's just a question of taste.;neutral
Haven't tried it yet. but look forward to it.;neutral
It's okay but not like the original Bisquick.  Was hoping it would be close to it but not really nearly as good.;neutral
It was OK but honestly I've had better tea for significantly less money;neutral
No texture--meaning no chunks--and it gives me heartburn--I have a stomach of steel and this is only thing that bothers me;neutral
You need to use a lot, (like two teaspoons in a cup of coffee) but no bitter after taste like Stevia for me. Not sure if I'll buy again.;neutral
Not the best. OK but no identifying flavors.;neutral
It comes in a cute little glass jar, and looks nice, but the candy tastes gross. It tastes like pure sugar. Isn't really worth the price for the candy, but maybe for the decoration.;neutral
Decent taste, but very hard to eat.;neutral
Not as great as other GODIVA products;neutral
The thin lid cracked open shortly after using it , the contents are ok,;neutral
I try to choose organic products when possible even though they usually cost more. Usually the taste is better too. However, this coffee tastes about the same as any brand coffee.;neutral
If you like really salty snacks these are ok but they are very salty.;neutral
These tasted a bit stale, will probably go with another seller next time.;neutral
I did not care for the taste of this water compared to Perrier and Canada Dry.  It had a taste but it wasn't grapefruit.  Also not very fizzy, but it was OK and I dank it all but I won't grt it again.;neutral
The cherry flavored one taste exactly like children's Tylenol. That could be good or bad depending on your kid.;neutral
Not that great of a taste, probably because it is sugar free.;neutral
Frontier Ceylon cinnamon is good , but I want the one that dissolves , this one goes to bottom of my coffee cup and then i have this big clump of cinnamon i have to swallow.;neutral
This is a good green tea but not the very best.;neutral
I think I just don't like this kind of rice at all, nothing against the brand.;neutral
Really want to love these, but haven't found how to use them so I can yet.;neutral
I WISH I WOULD HAVE ORDERED WHOLE BOX, BUT I WAS RUSHED. OOPS!;neutral
Get a lot of snacks in the basket. The crackers bags are bland, but everyone has different taste buds. Not sure if I would order from again.;neutral
"My son-in-law and youngest daughter found this ""interesting""  Apparently it contains sunflower seeds and/or nuts of some type.  They said, ""Waffles shouldn't taste like a granola bar.""";neutral
My Mistake...I thought it was steel cut oats...not quick oatmeal...oh well;neutral
Didn't have a creamy effect and took quite a bit in my coffee to feel like a creamer was added.;neutral
HAS NO ASPERTAME WHICH IS GOOD,  BUT THE  NICE FLAVOR DOES NOT LAST VERY LONG.;neutral
pricey and only use it in smoothies.;neutral
Bought these as appeared to be sugar free and they are not. Gave them away and was told not bad tasting though a little on the hard side;neutral
Not a bad tasting product. BUT, I try avoid beef snacks that are laden with MSG and Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein. THIS PRODUCT HAS BOTH!;neutral
"Lentils in a big bag. It came with no cooking directions or suggestions and when I emailed them the response was blah!
I didn't see the great customer service they bragged about. It must not be there.";neutral
"Not as strong as expected.  I expected one cup to keep me up all day, but that didn't happen.  Even two cup barely does the job.

Aroma not as good as Kicking Horse that I order regularly.";neutral
Like most rice, it has little taste.  I know it is healthy and will eat it, but doubt that I will reorder.;neutral
These are things you should not buy if you have a sweet tooth like I do, I can polish off a box in no time flat, I did not buy again after the first time.;neutral
Expected a bit more rind and not as much of the sweet . I don't think it tastes a lot like blood oranges, but it is so sweet, that's the only thing I take away from it.;neutral
Not bad, a little bland, but I'm happy enough with it that i will continue using it when I don't have time to make my own.;neutral
Needs more chocolate chips in the mix...  This is an ok product for a quick fix, but really needs more chocolate chips in the mix.;neutral
"These are a bit cheaper, but certainly NOT as good as the Anna & Sarah's figs.  The A&S figs are significantly larger and just more satisfying.
A&S figs are WORTH the bit extra price.";neutral
these taste okay but nutritionally speaking are not that great they are pretty high in fat and calories... i prefer the quest bars;neutral
Good product but just too spicy for me,I should have paid more attention to ingredients!;neutral
The sea salt and BBQ flavor are too much but at 100 calories per bag, they are a great snack.;neutral
Mediocre quality, cant buy onlime, must visit store!;neutral
"Bars are evidently healthly...containing a decent amount of protein and calcium. However, the taste leaves something to be desired. They do not taste good; yet, they are palatable.";neutral
Honestly, these aren't crackers. Just glued together flax seeds. Definitely try them, but they are not for me.;neutral
The first order I received was pretty good.  The second order had quite a few half or broken almonds and quite a few bitter almonds.;neutral
Great tasting and good stuff. Shipping leaves much to be desired;neutral
I know they're supposed to have cashews, but omg there are soooo many. Overall, the nuts are fresh but small. I'll probably go back to buying Kirkland (CostCo).;neutral
It's really smokey but not much else in terms of flavor. We put it in chili but on its own it would be disgusting.;neutral
Dry spicy, not our cup of tea. Great customer service;neutral
tasty but expensive for what you get. make your own - it's not difficult and is way less expensive.;neutral
These were okay, again the kids liked them.  To me, they had a different taste then the originals.  Great for parties, etc.;neutral
OK...too many blue chips compared to the rest.;neutral
It is an easy way to make jerky but we aren't fans of the flavor. Nothing wrong with product, just not to our liking.;neutral
It looked delicious but I was very disappointed to find it was made with flour,  I cannot eat wheat or gluten so I was unable to try it.  If that is not a problem, it looks great!;neutral
"hard for me to say; I'm new to almond milk and I'm not liking it";neutral
good timing some taste good and some... well they are do-able. lol;neutral
I like to sprout the buckwheat, but these did not sprout.  On the other hand I have had success with sprouting other buckwheat.  Perhaps they are not truly raw?;neutral
A bit on the salty side but a good variety of nuts. Tasty overall but stop using vegetable oil please.  That stuff is horrible for your health. Will not reorder.;neutral
I received these yesterday and couldn't wait to try them. I opened a pack and..... it was gross. I love combos but the taste is just plain weird. Not a good weird either. Stick to the pizza ones!;neutral
Ordered the coconut flavor one, wasn't really a fan of the flavor although I love coconut.;neutral
Expiration date before the end of 2018.;neutral
Hi, the taste of Vanilla overpowers the tea, I wish it was straight Cranberry.;neutral
watermelon Oreos sounded like a good idea you just can not beat basic Oreos and maybe a better fruit flavor would be banana;neutral
It is ok. In some of the cups the machine struggled to have the water flowing through. So I use all that I purchased and not planning of buying this anymore.;neutral
It's priced too high for the small 8oz bottle. It is used up too quickly. I probably won't buy it again.;neutral
They are very tasty however not as nutritious As you would think. Also most of them were melted previously.;neutral
Too much Stevia and not enough chocolate. Wanted to use this for flavoring kid's milk when they come to visit but it does not have a strong enough chocolate factor.;neutral
The Celsius (orange) cans are much better but don't fly well.;neutral
I ordered this soup as I felt it would be healthy to have on the self.  The flavor is good but the soup tastes so salty to me I am going to have a hard time using it up.;neutral
I like stash ... these were just ok. You need two bags to get a strong cup.;neutral
"A bit hard, and VERY small pieces so if this is your first taste of Turkish Delight, I recommend a ""plain"" flavor, or if you are like me, try the Rose flavor";neutral
A bit over priced but it tastes good!! Delivered fast too!!;neutral
These are okay as long as you only put 6 ounces of water in the coffee maker, otherwise the cappuccino is very weak. I'll buy other brands next time.;neutral
It tasted really vanilla , hardly no hazelnut taste in my opinion. I will not buy again. To overpowering in vanilla.;neutral
"For some reason, I thought there would be more of a ""kick"" to these. I think I prefer the other kinds of vegetable sticks. Not bad, but nothing outstanding.";neutral
"My wife like it, so she gets it.  Been married
for 44 years and I'm fully trained.  Ha!
I personally think it tastes like crap and is way
over priced.";neutral
I prefer Violet Crumble over Crunchie. It's really just a matter of preference - this isn't as soft a crunch as the competitor and I think Crunchie is also sweeter.;neutral
It was very salty to me. I am not a salt user. It is quick & easy & cheesy. Tastes ok.but I would not buy it again for me or my family.;neutral
The syrup lacks a pronounced sarsaparilla flavor.  The ingredients just list natural and artificial flavors so I would not buy it again.;neutral
I'm not impressed with this product it tastes horrible feel slimy going down my throat;neutral
Ok granola bar taste. It's crunchy.;neutral
PRICE is the only issue here. Search for better price.;neutral
They are good but often you will chew one that is real bitter.;neutral
it was ok, I won't be reordering because of the amount of fat and sodium in them.;neutral
The product has a good taste.  I have not used it very much.  I will be adding it to my smoothies for the nutrition.;neutral
The flavor is great but you only get about two spoonfuls of product in each cup.;neutral
biscotti were nice size but very hard in need of dunking;neutral
this one doesn't cook as well as my smaller one... oh well, better luck next time.;neutral
The taste is good. This cheese sauce is very thin. I will try it various ways. Doesnt dip well because of thinness.;neutral
Usually the cookies are moist, soft and chewy.  Half the shipment seems stale.  Cookeis are not soft and fall apart.;neutral
Flavor is good. However, a lot of them have been crystalized in the tube. I am not sure if that is normal from sitting around or not.;neutral
Was bought for my 4 year old as he is dye sensitive.  He didn't like these as well as the gummy bear ones.;neutral
Shipping was very fast. This coffee is ok if you do t look for a strong vanilla taste and you like weaker coffee. Well I like strong tast and strong coffee so this one was not as I expected.;neutral
Can barely taste any cinnamon... nice try but I think I will stick with PB-2 and add my own cinnamon..;neutral
THESE are very tasty and I enjoy them..;neutral
These are craisins! I thought they were dried, like the berries I've bought.;neutral
Doesn't really taste good.  has a strange aftertaste, but on the plus side it is really easy and quick to make.;neutral
too chocolate for me and hubby.  I will make the next batch without the topping.;neutral
Most regular k-cup coffees are good but they really need to lower there prices. There no need to pays these high prices for coffee that taste so so.;neutral
It's good...I won't buy it again though.  I've been putting it in my smoothies and can't taste it.  I can't put my finger on why I don't like it.;neutral
I love that this is organic but I can't get used to the taste;neutral
I am usually looking for sweet potatoes but end up with yams;neutral
This selection is better suited for a family with children;neutral
First time I've tried this, it's good but I guess I expected it to taste more like Tabasco (which I love).  It's something I will have to get used to, I like it, but thought it would be hotter.;neutral
Jar is very hard to open.  Coffee has little flavor.;neutral
Was disappointed to see that this product had added sugar in it. The kids of course liked it, but was glad when the last was drank up. Won't be buying again.;neutral
Cookies appear ok, I think kinda stale & hard but child seems to like. Cheese crackersare all broken up some bags feel as if almost crushed. May give a 2nd chance with another purchase...we will see?;neutral
not near chocolatey enough....disappointed in the flavor....suchard has a richer chocolate flavor;neutral
Not as good as good as other coffees I have purchased on Amazon.;neutral
Nearly tasteless, but great for toning down the taste of other cereal that is too highly seasoned.;neutral
except for not being organic, the almond milk is great and the packing works well.  we're switching to organic though;neutral
Ok, maybe a few pecans & filberts, but NOT ONE Brazil Nut in the ENTIRE bag!;neutral
There are more broken pieces than whole kernels. The color is also more brownish than off-white.  The taste was good, hence the three stars.;neutral
It's ok coffee, better than some, not as good as others that cost less;neutral
These are okay but they are not as good as the certified organic Brazil Nuts sold under the same label.  The organic ones tasted better and were more consistent in size.;neutral
Doing whole30 and I was looking for cream for my coffee. I usually use cream and sugar in my coffee. I was hoping this would make up for no sugar but it just didn't help. I'm just doing without coffee.;neutral
be sure you read the grind of the cofffee;neutral
a good product and  should be good for  people who are diabetis or can not use refined sugars.;neutral
quick filler for lunches or quick grab snack;neutral
USPS must have had fun with this package!  Maybe they played soccer with it.  some of the biscuits were broken and just crumbs.  But there were enough to enjoy.;neutral
"Too expensive.  I probably won""t order again.";neutral
Packaging is great and convenient, like the individual wrapping.  Flavor is a bit to be desired however.  To me these taste a little bland.;neutral
taste good, not sure if it is good for you, read carefully;neutral
Not like I remember it back in New Jersey;neutral
Taste is good but weak even when made on the smallest cup setting. Always leaves sediment in the bottom of the cup, so only the top of a small cup is drinkable.;neutral
Coating has good flavor balance and enhances the pecan flavor.  More of the pecans are pieces and chunks than there are of truly recognizable whole pecans which disappoints.;neutral
Some are empty. Just the cracker without the filling.;neutral
They have a very good and strong licorice flavor but why cany they be made to not dissolve and crumble so fast.;neutral
Very coarse and no where near Honeywell quality. I sift my almond flour first and have to throw out 1/3 of every amount I sift. Is it really cheaper, then?;neutral
just okay.  got this as a friend loves it.  I don't.;neutral
Okay, but does not dissolve very well;neutral
I have had other vanilla bean powders that I liked the taste of better.  This does not have as robust a flavor as I would have liked.  Perhaps a different variety of vanilla bean?;neutral
The flavor is ok, not great.  I was hoping to find something similar to the French Vanilla Cappuccino I get when I'm around a Tim Horton's but this isn't it.;neutral
nice cinnamon flavor, but flavor should last longer than it does.  not sure why all small square shaped gum is so hard.  not like stick gum.  (sugarless is what i buy, stick or squares);neutral
I was hoping for better taste.  Probabably still healthier than soda but very sweet.;neutral
yuck really bitter bad==maybe bad batch==but im not buying again;neutral
quick service  good price  seems bland;neutral
It's a hit or miss. I bought these a few times. Sometimes it's really good and fresh, other times its too ripened and no good at all. Customer service is pretty good though with that.;neutral
I didn't care for the flavor, I was disappointed .  I love coconut just about any way but this didn't have a lot of flavor. I won't get it again.;neutral
Pretty good pepper jelly but it is overpriced a bit.  You can get equally good pepper jellies at Christmastree shops.  Just not as good as the price.;neutral
OK but sauce is blander than bland with sweet as sub;neutral
It is hard for me to taste the chocolate ingredient in this coffee.;neutral
6 pieces and you're good for a colonoscopy..... no more.... less and you're good for an evening maybe poop once or twice...6+ and you better drink enough water.;neutral
but too sweet and not enough chocolate for my taste.. nuts were not so fresh ..I won t buy any more;neutral
I really can't taste the caramel all that much or the vanilla cream.;neutral
Nuts are great: but a little heavy handed on the sea salt for my taste, so will be trying another brand next time.;neutral
These are OK, but extremely SMALL compared to some other I purchased previously !!;neutral
Very creamy and very nice flavor...;neutral
Stars are for the product. Not sure what I was expecting, but terribly sweet for me. Colleagues are loving it though. Came in a special box with dry ice. Amazed!;neutral
Tastes fine but every time I use it, about as much dribbles down the side of the bottle as actually gets used.  How about a no-drip spout?;neutral
Wish I could order stronger blend from Amazon.;neutral
They're okay.  Taste similar to rice cakes, which are cheaper and readily available.;neutral
Good initial flavor, but very weak and the flavor doesn't even hold for 1 cup of tea :(  We'll stick with the Numi brand...;neutral
Tasty but too expensive imo..won't buy again;neutral
Didn't really impress us. We'll stick with the regular PG tea bags.;neutral
nothing to write home about........will not buy again;neutral
Three stars because they came melted.;neutral
Not at all what I was expecting. I thought I was getting a soft  cookie but it is hard.;neutral
These were not very moist and didn't have a lot of flavor. Maybe that's the way they are supposed to be but I did not like them. Will not buy again.;neutral
"Don't buy these if you have a ""Keurig 2.0"" brewer....they don't work without trying to circumvent the new ""authentic"" checks they have in place...";neutral
this product doesn't taste bad and it is super good for you, I just didn't like the texture much and will probably not be buying more for that sole reason.;neutral
The quality of the nuts was average and the price would have suggested that the nuts would taste fresher with better quality.;neutral
Not very strong, but had to try because I was born in Dubuque and a Mississippi River Rat.;neutral
Product as described, but has a weird taste. Fast shipping. A+++;neutral
Pods themselves are fine but Sara Lee which owns brand clearly does not care about brand and has no sense of customer service.;neutral
Luxardo cherries are amazing.... I didn't care as much for the Woodford Reserve cherries.;neutral
It tasted ok, but was gritty after mixing for a while.  Not as bad as other brands but the grit is so weird.;neutral
I usually love this flavor and brand, but this bag was too dry and chewy. tough on the jaw. It was 6 months before the expiration date, still.;neutral
This pack contained several flavors my family doesn't like.  I will stick with our favorites and skip the variety sampler.;neutral
Kids Chew.  2 minutes later, they want more. Flavor goes quick.....;neutral
Not chewy as I was expecting and wanted, but hard. Not stale, just not chewy like you want when you purchase a product that states CHEWY oatmeal...;neutral
"OK sparkling water, but not great!  Almost no berry flavor, very subtle; however water has a heavy mineral taste; almost salty.  Good carbonation.";neutral
I should have read more carefully - they contain caffeine :-(;neutral
Found a place to buy near by that ended up less expensive and a much bigger quantity!;neutral
"These are VERY difficult to chew; I suppose if they're meant to be gummed by a baby with no teeth they might work, but even for an adult, biting off a piece to actually eat it was very difficult.";neutral
For the price it is small. Up side it is already filled with goodies and no shopping at a store.;neutral
Tasted OK, but the outside of the wrappers left your fingers feeling greasy/sticky.;neutral
Good salt. Looks legit and gets the job done. I have no idea why there is a difference form the table salt I have other than the price really. So I have to give it three stars.;neutral
Not bad but too tangy for my taste. I like the sesame taste to come through and these had a pronounced tangy cheese flavor that masked the sesame.;neutral
Like drinking coffee flavored water.;neutral
It's ok but nothing to write home about.  I'm really having a difficult time finding decent coffee in the Tassimo brand.  I'm just about ready to break out my Keurig machine.;neutral
Actually everybody in the house tried these and not one of us actually liked them.;neutral
This item was good when it arrived but now it doesn't taste very good anymore. It has been a climate controlled environment ever since I received the item and its expiration date isn't until July of 2016.;neutral
We have an allergy to all mammal meat,  after receiving these realizing it had collagen casing listed,  we emailed Old Wisconsin after receiving no reply called and it was confirmed it is a beef casing.;neutral
I used to love this coffee, but this last purchase seemed to have lost the wonderful cinnamon aroma and flavor it once had.;neutral
I will echo what others have pointed out.  So Delicious makes some great non-dairy creamers, but they need to eliminate the bad stuff - we don't care if it's not snow white.;neutral
Very strong earthy flavor - tried to put in a smoothie but it was overpowering with the earthy taste;neutral
NICE PRODUCT BUT WAY TO EXPENSIVE FOR SIZE....;neutral
I like the banana one was great. Didn't like the others.;neutral
This is my least favorite Eight O'Clock coffee. The flavor is okay. Nothing great. I prefer Hazelnut and French Vanilla.;neutral
They taste ok and not nearly as tasty asi thought. Still they came earlier than expected. I won't order them again;neutral
I was hoping for a little more kick from the chile as I love the combination of flavor with chocolate. These fall a little flat.;neutral
The quality is good but I can get the same thing at China Town, same brand and package for $16 instead of $26.;neutral
It's okay, but I don't like it enough to order it again.;neutral
I don't like the taste of this product. I will not be trying these again.;neutral
Pretty decent, compared to what else is available on Amazon.  But that's the best I can say about this product, and that's not saying much.;neutral
Nutrionally, this is slightly worse than trail mix, but in a handy bar form.  The taste isn't bad, but I wouldn't go out of my way to make it a staple.;neutral
Should have had more tea.  Container is nice.;neutral
It is sweet, and it disappeared from the fridge quite fast after kids found it, but there is no distinctive currant, nor pear taste  to the syrup, so we, adults, passed on it.;neutral
"I have ordered the ""Roadhouse"" flavor of Campbell's chili and liked it much better.  This ""Firehouse"" chili isn't hot or spicey.  I had to add hot sause, cheese and other stuff to make it taste better.";neutral
"Disappointing that it isn't a full bottle as described.....the taste is good for me..
I hate it when sellers try to take advantage of us.....just be honest!!!";neutral
I love white chocolate, and these are great, except I found them to be too sweet.;neutral
"Taste like grass; must acquire the taste to appreciate it with or without sugar.";neutral
was expecting a tarter Raspberry taste but, was sweet instead;neutral
Good, but I like a richer, darker roast. I will try this brand again in another flavor like a darker roast.;neutral
"Not as I remembered - but maybe just that my childhood was a long time ago, and nothing seems to taste as good as it did then.
However, no problem with packaging. and very fresh.";neutral
The flower color was good but not great. There is another one sold on Amazon that is marvelous;neutral
Zero mass,  stick to flour and or cornstarch to thicken.;neutral
doesn't have quite the same flavor as restaurant ponzu or even other brands;neutral
Very small bags.  Price is high fir what you get.  Tastes fine.;neutral
I bought this because it was the only one I could chew while on the Ideal Protein diet. Flavor is great, but runs out very quickly.;neutral
Great lotion, but just not a fan of this particular scent. Gave it to a friend.;neutral
It' was broken with a hole poor inspection before the shipment;neutral
The dry coco powder has it's short comings.;neutral
As I remember my order, I was to get 3 or 5 packs.  I only received one.  Also, as I remember having this before, it was pretty good.  Watch your order.  It also took over 2 weeks.;neutral
The price of a 24 pack is more than double the price of normal 24 packs. Has an interesting taste but isn't worth the money.;neutral
a little to much Lime for my taste .;neutral
I personally prefer Coombs over this product. First time I ordered to try it out. Will do with it, but won't buy again. Tastes slightly woodier to me than the caramel, smooth taste of Coombs.;neutral
I didn't particularly care for the flavor. I do like a green black mix I found better;neutral
Taste good but a little high on the glycemic scale for me and the fact that it will kill my dog I will not buy again;neutral
Very inconsistent in quality.  I have bought alot of this over the past few months and sometimes it is perfect.  But when half the container is unripe.  it is terrible.;neutral
excellent ingredients, that are good for you maybe that is why they are just okay to taste, not something one would crave.;neutral
Not a favorite of mine. Kind of tart and not a great taste. I wasn't able to finish the bag, so I won't be buying again.;neutral
Useful if you can't find fresh for baking.;neutral
A bit too much garlic for me. I like garlic and it is a pretty strong garlic flavor. Ended up mixing it with other no garlic pastas.;neutral
"I bought this based on the ""add water only"" sell. Not true, you also have to add an egg and oil....

Disappointing...";neutral
These are not extracts.  I am familiar with the Super strength products.  As such, they go fast;neutral
Bought for Bloody Mary Drinks but Tomato Juice tastes better.  This is OK on it's own but does not have much flavor.;neutral
would have like the date later then it WAS , got them JUNE 8 /2013 30 BAGS AND THEY WOOD BE OLD BY JUNE 30/2013 NOT GOOD;neutral
Okay.  Priced like all the others on the market.  Nothing special taste-wise.  But an okay option in bulk?;neutral
Good, but I use these for my guests and use the Jones Brothers bold pods for my own selfish pleasure.;neutral
Decent and  on a dry side, but not as sweet as some other brands and kids did not like it as much.;neutral
The bottle arrived with broken lid. I tried returning it but it's not an option for this item.;neutral
The taste is fine, but its clumpy rather than smooth. I use it to make overnight oats and it is hard to mix together.;neutral
These are OK if you run out of creamer..they are great because you don't have to refrigerate, but we don't use them fast enough..Great to take to work etc.;neutral
Okay for a chocolate fix but not the quality I expected.  Its okay;neutral
Not plump . I ordered vanilla beans on Amazon before and they were AMAZING...these are just okay...still serve their purpose though.;neutral
I liked the mint and the chamomile, but was not a big fan of the other flavors. I especially didn't like licorices. I guess it comes down to personal tastes.;neutral
Tastes fine, but the sugar free version doesn't dissolve easily even in boiling hot water. Its so clumpy, you almost need to put it in a blender briefly to get it to mix without clumping.;neutral
The juice is okay but the flavors aren't that tasty, the apple taste too tart and the clementine is too bitter.;neutral
They were bigger than I thought they would be which was actually nice for their purpose.  I was a little disappointed in the flavor and texture.;neutral
Nice color, but a bit grainy to mix into carrier oils.;neutral
These are pretty good hot cocoa mix. Better with milk. Mixing it with hot water tastes a little weird. If you're lactose and tolerant, beware this will give you farts as it has real milk in its ingredients.;neutral
Love this chocolat, just not a fan of the cinnamon flavor, I love the vanilla and the almond one though. someone else may love it;neutral
I love these, but this last batch was past it's prime. There should be an expiration date on the box. When these get old, they get waxy then just turn into stale, ginger-flavored goo.;neutral
The wrap idea is amazing, I am giving it 3 stars since it tastes kind of sweet and it feels a little bit like eating plastic.;neutral
".The firm met all of the requirements for excellece
The coffee, though, is mediocre at best.";neutral
Decent mint patties but just came packed in a USPS box, no plastic container like in the picture.  There are better mint patties out there!;neutral
It is okay, I would have like a drink with a nice body of chocolate with a hint of mint, This is very light.;neutral
The miracle noodle in general is great but the angel hair stack together and its hard to separate them.;neutral
It taste strange I am unable to evaluate the coffiene level;neutral
this is my first time trying guar gum... and i realized that im not too crazy about it...it gives sauses strange consistency and taste, i will use traditional cornstarch instead;neutral
Stick to the pies, this was good but it fell apart and crumbled when I tried to cut it into pieces.;neutral
Works for marinades. Too much of a smoke and vinegar taste for me.;neutral
These are decent. A bit oily and too thick;neutral
I ordered this on 2/6 figuring that it would arrive well before 2/14.  The website said it would arrive in 4-5 days.  It took more than twice that long to arrive.;neutral
Tangerine Ginger is A bit bitter for my tastes. But still really good.  I just can't get past my love for the Tumeric Ginger I think.;neutral
Not much flavor.  Good crunch though.;neutral
I didn't know they were mini size when I ordered this so I'm kinda disappointed. It's not exactly in the biggest print. Everything tastes fine and the product arrived intact.;neutral
The taste was not that great to me.  But if you add it into a smoothee or milkshake with some other ingredients, it's ok.;neutral
It's healthy. You can add spices and it's good.;neutral
Just okay.  Not much orange flavor comes through but I suppose it's meant to be subtle, not over-powering.  Good value for the money.;neutral
Good delivery and good support / a diet drink with sugar and way over price;neutral
"flavor was sweeter than expected, but still good
I'd like a little more smokiness and teriyaki flavor";neutral
Liked it but don't buy anymore because I avoid aluminum.;neutral
I used to love these! I don't know what happened. They changed them,, not very good anymore.;neutral
OK. Not fond of taste. It seemed to work better on my daughter than me.;neutral
I have found a better decaf as far as taste. This is OK for aroma, but could be better for taste.;neutral
"I honestly did not notice a difference in my energy or stamina. I am a mother of 3 and was wanting a boost like caffiene but not from coffee; this was not that. More dizzy than boosting.";neutral
I love lavazza... But these beans a little too dry for me;neutral
The product should put in the headline that it is pistachio. I bought them thinking that they were regular mozart kugeln. When I received them, I found out that they were pistachio, which I don't like.;neutral
Product is as advertised. The lemon adds a different taste, Does not please my palate. I like more of a traditional olive flavor.;neutral
The seaweed was not the thin vibrant and not mushy seaweed I get at sushi establishments.  This was too salty and not seasoned well.  The abundant seseame seeds were wonderful.;neutral
a decent white silver needle. Have enjoyed others better.;neutral
Great product,  my kids love them.  I purchased these at a fair price but now see the price has sky rocketed on amazon.  Crazy.  I'll go back to buying these in my local store.;neutral
This is alright - doesn't have the weird undertaste that the regular syrup does, but it's not as good as store bought root beer.;neutral
It did not make the cut for me for now, I am withholding judgment till I work out my recipes w/ it.  It just lacked flavor, that warm sweet corn flavor if you know what I mean.;neutral
"I had higher hopes
for this.
I didn't like it that much.
Based on the reviews I'm surprised.
Different flavor profile than I expected.
Not bad, but not that great.";neutral
Using a jackhammer to get honey out isn't our idea of the perfect buy, but it is organic and it is raw.  We did find organic raw honey downtown recently which is much easier to use, however.;neutral
"If you are looking for ""Bold"", this isn't it.  I'm disappointed.  I haven't found ""Bold"" in a k-cup yet.";neutral
"Not impressed, vague flavor. Got a sample ($2) and my wife & I tried both flavor and wasn't a hit at all.
The info-mmercial caught our attention but definitely not the product.";neutral
As far as white chocolate, it was pretty average. I had hoped german branded chocolate would taste way better than American brands. In my opinion, they don't.;neutral
The hot chili pops have a great flavor, just what you would expect: sweet and spicy. I only received the mango chili flavor although the pack with mango and lime was advertised.;neutral
"This tea is just OK. I don;t love it because it doesn't taste nearly as good as tea made with fresh Lavender. It is also messy, and should come in bags.";neutral
The caffeine strength is there, but the taste is not.  Somewhat bland.  Have to mix with other coffee grounds to achieve desired taste for me.;neutral
If I buy one bag at a time, it's stays fresh but a case of it justs gets too hard for me to eat.  Going to try and put it in hot cereal, that might soften it up.  When it gets hard, its very hard to chew.;neutral
Meh for Peets. Lil Bang for too much buck.;neutral
Good flavor, but too chewy for the price.;neutral
I figured a variety pack would be good with 3 kids, as with anything else, I still have some leftover and some were gone instantly.  Love Annie products just not variety packs with the kiddos.;neutral
Was okay. Tasted slightly off from the pickled garlic I normally have. Maybe it's just not what I'm used to.;neutral
Pretty good coffee, but more expensive than most.;neutral
It was pretty good Coffee over all.  Not the Best I've ever had but then it's priced well and for the money a good buy.;neutral
They weren't as sweet nor as juicy as i remembered.;neutral
Price went up $2 in the last month. Good product.;neutral
I love Werther's, but this product was just eh. Not a lot of pretzel. Just like potato chips, more air than product. 2 servings max.;neutral
This product seemed to lose some of its flavor after awhile.  I used it infrequently in baking.  It didn't have as much zing that I initially expected.;neutral
The strawberries are much better for our taste.  My 11 YO thought the raspberries were too bitter.;neutral
Ok...need to get the other kind next time;neutral
It doesn't have as much flavor as I hoped for - it was good. It just didn't have a lot of spice.;neutral
Not as lemony flavored as I expected.;neutral
I gave it a try because of the promotional discount.  The cookies were overpriced and arrived a little crumbled, but were good nonetheless.;neutral
"Great taste but almost broke a ftien
Far too many hard pieces";neutral
Good but causes heartburn/indigestion.;neutral
BEWARE THE BOTTLE IS ABOUT HALF FULL! The texture is a little gritty but tolerable. I really like it, however, due to the bottle being about half full, it is pricey!;neutral
My daughter no longer eats these due to the health issues.;neutral
"Item arrived as described. In the future, I will purchase from a local store; thought this would be less, but I was wrong. Otherwise very happy with the item.";neutral
The quality and the freshness was fine.  However, I should have ordered Dry Roasted, lightly salted which is more to my liking.;neutral
I have had Fresher green beans but all in all, they were pretty good..;neutral
It has that chocolate donut flavor... but a little weak on the flavor leaves you wanting more with every cup.;neutral
At first I thought these were amazing but unless I drink coffee the taste lingers.;neutral
I gave this 3 stars but it should be more like 3  1/2 . I am not wild about the chocolate one. But it's okay.;neutral
This flavor of yogi tea was good, but not great. I had seen other people say it tastes like apple pie, however, it is not a very strong flavor at all. I cannot even taste it after the first few sips!;neutral
"Excellent product!! A simple way to add flavor to soups and gravies. The ""Five Star Chef"" of the New York Hilton couldn't do any better.";neutral
Tasted a little old.  Too light for my taste buds.;neutral
Not enough ice packed and candy was all melted. Love this assortment of cans only will never order again in the summer due to our heat.;neutral
tastes more like spice than pumpkin flavor. Just ok, especially at this very high price. Our son loves them, to that is good enough.;neutral
I love the tea. It's the best peach flavored green tea you can buy, IMHO. But the padded mailer did nothing to protect the boxes & they arrived opened & mangled, and very late.;neutral
"use sparingly as will add a ""fake"" flavor taste if too much";neutral
My husband uses this with pea protein (!) for his breakfast...why?;neutral
It is ok, but they could use a better bottle.;neutral
These bars are pretty small and don't have a lot of flavor. The main problem though is that the chia gets stuck in my teeth so easily. I won't buy them again.;neutral
Not bad, but not great. I guess my taste in coffee is a bit unusual. I don't see how it got so many 5 star reviews.;neutral
after the three samples i am still not sure if this is a product i would purchase.  one cup was great while two were only mediocre.;neutral
This product is salty! But the chicken taste is great. Good for soups. Shipping and packaging were good.;neutral
Last time before this I bought 2 pounds and the packaging was better and more careful on sending.  In the last bought the packages were dusty and 1 was opened.;neutral
"The cashews themselves were delicious.  However, many were ""broken pieces"" and there was ""nut dust"" of about 1 1/2 inches in the bag.  Perhaps, a different style bag would solve this problem.";neutral
"Not much wasabi pungency; peas were smaller than other brands I have tried. Package arrived on time and undamaged.";neutral
Goji berries are ok I used them in chocolate chip cookies but cranberries work just as well.;neutral
Deliciousness of my youth but hugely salted;neutral
"I did not experience the ""boost"" but the tea tastes good.";neutral
JJ Virgin recommended this coconut milk.  I thought it was fine until I tried Native Forest!  So Delicious is SO Watered Down.;neutral
I didn't like how my food was packaged the produce was midioker;neutral
It has a good flavor. I just don't like the amount of sugar these are coated in.;neutral
"I love the tropical flavor; however the tea is quite bitter -- which I wasn't expecting!  Adding a bit of sugar does help a little.";neutral
Just too coarse, for my grinder to handle it. I suppose I could blame the grinder, but, the crystals are...large.  Too large, methinks.;neutral
Tastes great but does have harmful a ingredient which is the red 40, food coloring and food dyes are very bad it will give you ADHD;neutral
i enjoy this brownie brittle but where are the chocolate chips?  have to eat a lot of pieces to find a chocolate chip. i would like to be able to buy this product in 100 calorie bags.;neutral
I love these, I use them to add flavor to my coffee and a little Stevie to make a delicious zero calorie drink.;neutral
Good flavor, but getting too costly here.;neutral
Nice snack, but a bit dry. Don't think I'd buy them again.;neutral
Nice and chewy, but the flavor is very weak.;neutral
"Great price but the coffee isn't spectacular and the K-cup doesn't work in the Keurig 2.0 unless you use the ""trick"" shown on the internet to make the cartridge work. Won't be buying these again.";neutral
I have definitely had better chocolate and the bacon flavor is faint but they were still edible.  For the price, I expected better.;neutral
VERY BITTER TASTING NOT AS GOOD AS THE ONE I'VE BOUGHT IN THE PAST;neutral
"These were just overly wet. To a point where multiple super soft (almost ""smooshy"") prunes were stuck together.";neutral
The flavors were so mild it was difficult to know what was what. And they certainly were not the bright colors in the ad;neutral
Not as good as some of the other bars, kinda hard but not bad.;neutral
Not as strong as I like, but still tasty coffee. Maybe I'm not awake! Hah;neutral
Very nice taste but too salty for me;neutral
Taste is good. The texture is very crumby however.;neutral
Not sure why this product is so highly rated, it's just okay. Something to munch on when there's nothing else around.;neutral
I love passionfruit. I was hoping to get that sweet acidtic taste I crave , without spending a fortune. This is a jelly, very sweet, but I do not get the passionfruit taste I was looking for.;neutral
Kernels are nice and large, but lots of husks.  You'll be picking husks out from your teeth for quite a while after eating a bowl of this popcorn.;neutral
I tried these with a few different recipes....they were just okay.  I'd not buy them again, i'd rather not have noodles than try to eat fakes ones.;neutral
Got this for my husband to eat with his chips - unfortunately, he wasn't crazy about it.;neutral
First package was great, second had a lot that went bad quickly.;neutral
I really don't have enough words to fill this spot so lets just say I love Chinese cooking and this is okay.;neutral
"These were ok; a bit stale, but rare to find.  If you like your licorice soft, these are not for you.";neutral
It's just okay, but I prefer a more robust flavor, so I switched to Lavazza.;neutral
This kind of product I have gotten in the store before. Its OK, it just doesnt have the same taste as good old fashioned uncooked bacon;neutral
Getting expensive very fast twice the price from a year ago!;neutral
Not the best ever. I like panforte, but this was fairly dry.;neutral
Great Value, but just not fresh. My bag was soft.;neutral
Didn't care too much for this coffee.;neutral
I did not realize that 2 oz is not very much, for the money it is not worth it.  Go to the store and get the larger bottle for half the money.  The product itself is awesome!  My new favorite hot sauce.;neutral
Edible, but that's about the best I can say.;neutral
For those who like medium to mild roasts, this will probably suit them. For us, we're sticking with the Colombian Roast.;neutral
Didn't appeal to me. The flavor is mediocre;neutral
It's okay.  Not the greatest.  But the price was decent.  Probably won't buy it again though as I'm looking for a richer flavor.;neutral
"not what I expected.... but what  you can expect for the ""cheap price"" ?...........";neutral
This is ok, but there is another brand that I have purchased that I liked better. This one has too mild a flavor, the cardamon is a little too strong for my tastes. I like a little more spicy.;neutral
Cookies were stale, small, and not very many.  A great disappointment. Also terribly overpriced.;neutral
Tasty, but not a good value for the high price.;neutral
It is OK when you do not have time.  It has a bit strong fake Matsutake flavor.;neutral
I have bought thisd befoer and thought it was okay.  This time I thought it was spicy and wife and I  did not like it.;neutral
This tea isn't as strong as I like my herbal teas. I wouldn't purchase it again.;neutral
they are kind of stale, and not much flavor.;neutral
"Disappointing.  Did not find that ""theatre"" flavoring many had raved about.  Pretty ordinary  flavoring in my opinion, plus it makes a mess of the popper if you add it to the oil.";neutral
not much for money,doesnt seem like coffee is in there.;neutral
but these have less..........much less calories. The flavor is much more mild. I look for them on the warehouse deals and the price can't be beat for either.;neutral
I like these and would have given 5 stars but like many say... Flavors are only a few and 1 root beer.  Mostly cherry, orange and lemon, which I don't like lemon, but the flavor it good.;neutral
This coffee tastes ok but it smells horrible.;neutral
I did not like the taste.  Sorry.  However, I will continue to try other new products of KIND.;neutral
The green ones are disgusting, the rest were great!;neutral
This was too bitter for my taste. I've seen a few reviews with suggestions on how to help this but haven't found a way that I'm happy with.;neutral
I wish there was not as much sugar added;neutral
Good taste, but you may want to research the side effects, especially if you have sensitive digestive system. Most people may not fully digest the main ingredient.;neutral
Decent coffee's but you don't get exactly what is called out.;neutral
They don't seem to still to the food when frying chicken, as well as others I have tried. Should be ok for oven baking.;neutral
This one is ok, adds flavor and yes I will continue to buy this one also.  Several people seem to like it as well;neutral
I thought I was buying the larger bottle because I looked at the ounces on the bottle as advertised and read it to read the 3 plus oz bottle which is why I chose it.;neutral
Not that Sour Patchy. It really isn't that much different than the regular fruity Stride gum.;neutral
I love this brand of ghee butters.  I have tried all the flavors and get them on Subscribe and Save.  Im just not a big fan of the truffle butter.;neutral
"Tastes good and flavor lasts quite a bit.
The ""White"" may just be the coating on the gum. Did not see any effect to teeth.";neutral
I found this to be grainy, but not terrible tasting. I wouldn't buy again since there are better brands out there.;neutral
I was hoping this was like the restaurant's version and although it's close, it's not the same.  The ginger is very overpowering.;neutral
it is ok, better than my last two batches, just sometimes bags are not sealed and that gives me a saftey concern;neutral
Nothing special, not bad, not great. Would purchase it on sale. Blab, blab blab. Yadda yadda yards, and so on.;neutral
I bought it to help keep spiders away. It smells good but I haven't noticed if it keeps the bugs away that much.;neutral
Very plain comparing to San Pellegrino, overly carbonated;neutral
I would have given it a higher rating if it was less expensive. It tasted good but there are others that are just as good if not better for less.;neutral
"It's okay.  Not a bold flavor, more of a medium.  Not dark.  My wife will drink this.
I'm looking for my grandma's coffee and this is not it.";neutral
Good cup of coffee but the residue in the bottom of the cup was a bit disappointing from a name like Tim Horton.;neutral
They were large plantains.  The one problem was that I ordered 6 green and 6 yellow.  I did not get 6 green they were all  yellowish..;neutral
Secret is to nearly double the recommended amount.  Buy the Sidamo.;neutral
Delicious and versatile. Not thrilled with the oil used to keep them soft;neutral
Used in breadmaker and followed instructions. Very hard crust and flavor just ok. Not like the caraway rye you'd get in a delicatessen.;neutral
We like the taste. We love the name and the piratey drawings. We have boys. What we don't like is the package size. There is an awful lot of air in the bags and sometimes not a lot of booty.;neutral
Crunchy and taste ok but too expensive. Would probably buy again if price was reasonable.;neutral
The sugar-free flavor is not my version of good old vanilla pudding.;neutral
Love the product, hate the price.  I make my own now.  It's very easy to do!;neutral
Not so fragrant but good for the price. Now the current price is $34.00. I wonder if somebody is buying since it is only $18.00 more or less in Asian Supermarkets.;neutral
A little too granular, okay to use in smoothies. Intense grassy flavor.;neutral
i got three boxes, but the expiration date was about 2 weeks after i got them;neutral
Just toasted coconut flakes, thought it was more like a chip. Sweet coconut flavor in both bags but didn't taste a caramel salt flavor;neutral
Won't order again, I don't like the taste and they're over priced. They taste sour;neutral
Not quite as gelatinous as others I've tried, kinda grainy.;neutral
"Not a very ""tasty"" product. Flat tasting. Maybe it was old.";neutral
Just OK. I will not buy it again. I would rather cook some bacon.;neutral
Not any better than cheaper Almond milk brands;neutral
I did read the description but the juice was much sweeter than I expected. Good flavor except for that.;neutral
It's decent tasting. I've had better. I've had worse. It really doesn't have that big of a smokey taste. Neither is it that hot.;neutral
If you like peeps you will like these. Nothing special about them there just peeps. My kids like them during Easter .;neutral
Ok, but not very strong flavor. Won't buy again.;neutral
I had never tried this befere but I thought it was pritty good :-). I might get it again with my next order too.;neutral
"I bought this to try to help my ""chicken skin"".  While it has helped soften it, I still have the raised, red bumps.  Now, on the other hand, it does make for a wonderful hair conditioner!";neutral
Not bad tasting. Good to have in the cabinent for emergencies.;neutral
Good coffee and chickory ~ Strong and bold;neutral
Love that it's all natural.  Don't like the spongy texture.;neutral
Too little for the money! Each container was only 15.8 ounces. Taste good like at the Froyo store;neutral
Different taste, OK, my daughter Loved them, Gluten Free.;neutral
Eh. They taste chalky. Chocolate is better.;neutral
they came quit broken but even the pieces were Oreos;neutral
I usually like this coffee but this batch not as good and leaves a residue in my cup.;neutral
It's a bag of cotton candy... not really much to say about that.;neutral
not bold enough. went back to newmans own;neutral
Coulda done without wasabi eawwwwwwww;neutral
They were OK. Didn't taste much like Cinnamon Buns to me. They need to be less sweet, have more Cinnamon and butter flavor.;neutral
Eh...they're ok, not as good as my favorite white cheddar bunnies tho;neutral
Got this for me and my mother to try and we both agreed that we are glad we tried it but it wasn't worth the price.;neutral
I don't know if these have changed since I was a kid, or if it's just my taste buds, but these taste off to me. Not like I remember. Leave a strange taster in your mouth. The price was good though.;neutral
This bacon salt is okay, but it doesn't taste as good as I was hoping. It tastes okay on popcorn, but not on anything else.;neutral
smells great in pouch, the tea taste wasn't add good.  couldn't really taste peppermint.;neutral
I didn't realize that this had the lavender in it. I was intending to purchase just the earl grey plain. My mistake. Just not to my liking.;neutral
Loved the taste but this item caused a lot of flatulence. Something in this doesn't agree with me. Sad...;neutral
I really just tested these but was surprised by how thick the tips actually are, I hoped doing some precision calligraphy work on food with these, looks like I'll have to look for another option.;neutral
This soup was just okay. Flavor is good, texture is fine, but I would have liked it better with some pieces of real mushroom in it.;neutral
This soup is tastey but almost too spicey! I made it with only 1/2 of the spice packet and it was much better.  There seems to be a real salty taste with the whole packet.;neutral
"They are a great price and okay tasting. Too much bread in comparison to fig; I prefer more fruit less cookie.";neutral
They didn't seem super fresh. They were really hard and had very little flavor. Maybe just a bad batch this time.;neutral
They're delicious.  The box arrived open .  The red lid was more than ajar, The candies were stale.  I ate them anyway;neutral
Much too dry and hard for me. Low in salt which is good. Did not find them to be satisfying.;neutral
I am concerned about the very short shelf life left on this product - 07/01/2017/  Is this normal?;neutral
I did not really dig this flavor, but only because of the diet aftertaste common with most all diet drinks.;neutral
Awesome idea. Kids love them. I found them to be a bit stale. Would try again, but a different brand.;neutral
Could have a stronger flavor, but I've learned to just use a little more.;neutral
Product is fairly good but a bit to dry using the amount of water suggested on directions.;neutral
It isn't as caramel tasting as I had hoped.;neutral
We really love the Kinder Joy eggs so I wanted to try this assortment.  We're not quite as fond of the fillings in these though.  They're okay but I won't buy again.;neutral
Not particularly hot (picante), but a good Major Grey style chutney.;neutral
The dough is a little on the dry side. The chocolate bit flavor is mild.;neutral
not nearly as sweet as expected only mildly sweet have to at least double amount to equal sugar in a recipe;neutral
Was a bit disappointed, the taste is alright, but not worth the overall price;neutral
"Interesting flavor. I personally like the maple syrup version much better.
Still not bad but not more than 3 stars worth.";neutral
Im not used to tuna w/o mayo. This is dry, the initial taste is a sour from the lemon. Its not spicy or anything, just off to me. Needs mayo or something to moisten it. Edible, just not my favorite.;neutral
"It was ""ok""....I wish it came in a coffee pod...it's hard for me to get ""instant"" coffee down....not the same as perked.";neutral
tender very good but too sweet for my taste;neutral
Good Wolfgang Puck product, just not my taste.;neutral
This is definitely not my favorite rose tea.  The rose flavor becomes a bit overwhelming if you let it steep for long.;neutral
The seal of protection was missing.;neutral
As a sampler pack, this is what we hoped for.  However, the size of each flavor is about enough for a single serving, so not quite as much value as I would have hoped.;neutral
Normally good! Last order they were terrible! Rotten!;neutral
It's alright, but I don't care for the palatability (not the taste, but the chewiness of it). If the flour wasn't available, I would definitely buy it again, but I prefer the flour.;neutral
Kids like it. I'm from the south, so its not my style.;neutral
These were expensive and not my favorite.;neutral
It's okay. Does help the flavor of my slimfast shakes a little bit but not as much as I would like it to.;neutral
"Not bad, not great.  When you need a lot of coffee for a cheap price this will do the trick, but otherwise spend a little more and avoid ""blends""";neutral
It's OK, but too sweet for my taste. I fail to see the need for 'cane syrup' in the ingredients at all--my opinion;neutral
The flavor was okay, but the price was more than I would spend a second time.;neutral
"Love the grape. Berry is OK. Orange is like Shasta and not desirable; but a 12 yr old neighbor likes it.";neutral
Just like any agave but overpriced. It is cheaper at my local Kroger store.;neutral
I really couldn't tell there was any seasoning on my food when using this product.  I think I get more flavor with Mrs. Dash.;neutral
I was disappointed with the taste.  They were a little to sweet for me.;neutral
Changed my mind about using this.. :S  Maybe some day I'll try it.;neutral
Good tasting mix.  Bought this as a gift for my niece to take to boarding school with her.  But the price is outrageous.  It may be vegan and all natural (and maybe organic), but it's not powdered gold.;neutral
Great aroma right out of the bottle but after pressure cooking my pork I could barely detect any aroma.;neutral
3 stars because it came rather melted.;neutral
"Have ordered lots of coffee from this Company.
This is the first time the beans were really dry.
Glad it was only the 2 pound bag.
Will continue to buy.";neutral
"Good not great.
Single origin coffee from Strbx about same price Guatamala or Kenya and, I think they are better tasting";neutral
good stuff but coconut flour better and cheaper thanks.;neutral
I love Nature's Path but decided to try this because of the lower sugar and the price is so good.  But I'm not impressed.  Going back to Nature's Path, it's better tasting and healthier.;neutral
Somewhat like I remembered. Sweet and satisfying. A bit expensive but for nostalgic purposes was worth it.;neutral
Has an odd, oily taste to it, but my roommates seem to like it.;neutral
useful for pickling but fresh is always better;neutral
don't get the lemon flavor as long as with Brach's;neutral
It's okay, but has a flavor in it that is not so pleasant. Can drink it, but wouldn't order it again.  Much prefer Green Mountain's Golden French Toast.  Have used that quite a while and would purchase again.;neutral
These are NOT for Keurig 2.0 systems but it is very good hot cocoa.;neutral
I bought this tea for my mother who like decaf. Unfortunately there is way too much redolent bergamot in this Earl Grey and she's not a fan. It's drinkable but not as nice as Stash's English Breakfast.;neutral
A mixture of rice and pasta and salt. My dog loves it.;neutral
"Too expensive for the amount and the cardboard taste.
Even the wasabi peas have no taste. One ingredient does taste sweet.";neutral
This must be an acquired taste I personally didn't care for it I did not see any benefit;neutral
I don't taste any difference between this and a 2 pound bag of generic oolong.  For the price one would expect more.;neutral
Bought a box, liked it so I bought a few more boxes.  The last box we opened had a lingering aftertaste that we did not like.  We never finished the box and went back to another brand.;neutral
The product is not bad for a quick, inexpensive meal, but the sauce is a bit watery.  It is okay if a person adds their own ingredient like extra sauce or melted cheese.;neutral
These are good, husband & grandson loves them, however Everytime they get delivered at least 1-3 have leaked all over the box (due to bad packaging );neutral
Bland, but it is non-sweetened. Tastes decent with some honey!;neutral
I expected these to be more like kippered and softer, basicly a long jerky stick;neutral
Product is very salty. Seller is great.;neutral
Tastes ok, but it's not as thick as honey should be.;neutral
tastes faintly of cinnamon. not bad.;neutral
Nuts tasted fine, but were disappointingly too small;neutral
It is healthy, it also stinks and leaves yucky aftertaste. If I can find a recipe it would go in and not ruin, may use it up that way but I am not a fan.;neutral
For a pumpkin decaf it is okay.  I would repurchase but it ist the best one I have had.  The actual pumpkin flavor is a very subtle.  I would prefer bolder taste.;neutral
I like the flavor but even if I steep it extra long this tea just isn't strong enough for me.;neutral
"I don't like this
as much as other brands.
The flavor is not as good.";neutral
Ah peanuts, pecans, other kinds work good in this heart trainer. There is enough salt;neutral
Did not meet my expectations but my friends loved them not buying again;neutral
This jerky tastes very good, But it requires a lot of hard chewing to soften and break it up to swallow.;neutral
Might be a healthy snack but I didn't taste any mango or coconut. Doesn't taste bad but not something I would crave more of.;neutral
I prefer the GI Pro Health starter.  Cheaper in the long run & not as tart.;neutral
Only able to order one time as Amazon Fresh was discontinued in my area.;neutral
They are alright.  The beans inside the chocolate are not super tasty but they are okay.  Same for the chocolate.  Just kinda not that awesome but not bad either.;neutral
The butter toffee flavor isn't very strong.  The coffee is not my favorite, but it isn't horrible.  I had to use more flavored creamer to make it enjoyable than I use in my regular flavored coffee.;neutral
Good value but comes loose in a bag.;neutral
Okay taste.  The pistachios are not fresh.;neutral
Never could get the darn thing to germinate.;neutral
Not all that great. Seemed a bit chalky tasting. I would give it fewer stars, but my wife (and daughter) liked it so it must appeal to some pallets.;neutral
Weak in taste, but I haven't found any decaf caffee strong enough for my taste. Otherwise, this product is OK.;neutral
Love the flavor but product was caked and lumpy.;neutral
i cant really judge the spice, since it is the first time i ordered a moroccan seasoning;neutral
So they're natural - they taste as I would expect natural jelly beans to taste, a little bland and a slightly unexpected texture.;neutral
Good, but not the healthiest. Bought to give out on Halloween. Better for kids, a bit, than just candy!;neutral
not strong enough for me.  tastes watered down.;neutral
It's okay, but will not buy it again.;neutral
The nuts were fresh and tasty but had only a hint of salt & vinegar. If you're looking for tangy, this isn't it.;neutral
My husband had a craving for a Clayton fruitcake. Unfortunately, it wasn't as good as he remembered. Im sure it tasted the same. He just misremembered.;neutral
Most of the bags in the box were deflated and stale;neutral
"*Very* strongly gingery; not much lemon flavor.";neutral
Tasty for SF but for real, 8 coins of chocolate for $6?;neutral
This tastes good only if you add 2 or 3 teaspoons of sugar to it. The cost of this is exorbitant. Cannot recommend.;neutral
Good but. Slices were very thin and stubby.;neutral
This quinoa is ok....it is a bit crunchy even after 30 minutes of cooking...I probably will wait for the price to come down to purchase my old brand.;neutral
Too strong for me.  I stick with black earl grey teas.  It is still smooth flavor, but just too bold for me.;neutral
"Gave them to my family too, too sweet for my taste.  My daughter and her family really like them so all is good didn't
feel that I wasted my money.";neutral
"Contents were much smaller than expected (my bad for not inspecting the size- 4 oz).

My bag (crackers) was all smashed up, basically crumbs < very few whole intact crackers.";neutral
only gave 3 stars as it is too expensive.;neutral
I use this for pasta and pizza. It tastes ok. Nothing fancy about it. But the expiration date is in three months. Kinda challenge.;neutral
It was ok tasting. I personally think the teriyaki spam taste more like tocino. My opinion;neutral
Not  crazy about decaf and there were several in here.;neutral
Its white bread. I was hoping for a more rustic loaf but it's pretty standard.;neutral
VERY EXPENSIVE AND HALF THE NUT'S LOST THE GLAZE COVERING;neutral
This is super hard to make food with, we had to use so many eggs and so much almond milk to mix with. The pancake I made was not in a shape at all. I bought a bag of flaxseed flour and it works pretty well!;neutral
these are nothing more than a boring oreo, probably made by the same company who makes oreos, there is only the slightest hint of mint flavor, which is why i ordered them.;neutral
This has a very peppery taste that I wasn't expecting.;neutral
Not what we expected after so many great reviews!  Don't waste your money on this mix.;neutral
not a strong ginger tea if you buy add ginger powder;neutral
These aren't overly spicy but the flavor does not last long.  These are more sweet than spicy. They aren't bad but I wouldn't buy them again.;neutral
This is a great blend in theory but the taste comes out like you're eating a Yankee Candle, despite it being organic.;neutral
Very good soup with no salt added. It's light on chicken, but good taste. Recommend adding some vegetables and garlic to broth. This only a suggestion. Other soups have 3 times the amount of salts.;neutral
Better than Sprite...but just barley. Nowhere near as good as Stewarts Key Lime soda.;neutral
There seem to have quite a bit of seeds that need to be spat out as you eat these berries.;neutral
"Bag shown is full, bag received was 1/3 full. Just letting folks know.
Nuts seem fresh so far.";neutral
Very salty.  Halves and pieces.  Mediocre flavour.;neutral
Yummy but just a little too much, very dry and it TASTES like healthfood if you catch my drift.;neutral
They were ok seemed to taste a little older/stale so we did not enjoy them as much;neutral
not impressed, not to mention the amount of calories per serving is scary;neutral
I thought these were the larger containers so when I received them, I was really disappointed in the small size. I bought this to make a huge amount of no bakes for a bake sale.;neutral
It's good, but we've gone back to Costco for better pricing.;neutral
The flavor is good but it has a lot of skin or something that makes eating it less than enjoyable.;neutral
Like the 10 grain cereal I bought, this seems a little too bland  I bought them for the health benefits and thought I could doctor them to taste better;neutral
"Not better than ""gourmet"" salt and ""tastes saltier"" than regular, maybe because coarse.";neutral
Ok but not as good as local roaster...cheaper but no idea how old;neutral
If you like strong tea, this isn't for you.  I like the taste but would like it a bit stronger.;neutral
Tastes more like peach than apricot. Sad face;neutral
Not sure if these almonds are truly unpasteruized. I purchased another brand and compared it to this one. The other brand appears to be unpasteruized...unlike this one.;neutral
"PUR gum holds if flavor for a short time.... and I have to have two pieces to equal one of the other brand...
but the best part is that it has no aspartame...";neutral
Great tasting coffee, but too harsh on my thought. It got irritated after drinking this coffee.;neutral
Nice flavor from OliveNation.  Wish they offered it in an organic version.;neutral
Beaware.. Smaller than packets you get in store!! They are almost mini.;neutral
Good value. A kinda good taste but I never want a second cup. Dark roast that tastes slightly burned.;neutral
"Just ok; tried to get something more like Whitley's but guess I should get the more expensive brand.";neutral
I really like the vanilla, caramel or chili varieties, but the taste of this variety is disappointing. There is very little mocha/coffee taste detectable.;neutral
good cookies but i found the crackers to be bland and some were stale.;neutral
It okay, I prefer plain coffee like Folger's Columbian.;neutral
It's all front of tongue heat. There isn't a lot of depth to it and it doesn't change much as you keep going. But it eats ok.;neutral
good flavor, bottles don't go far tho.;neutral
Overall the gum is okay. Unfortunately I had to chew two pieces at the same time because the pieces are pretty small. It is a tad hot for my dry mouth though so I probably won't buy this one again.;neutral
These taste pretty good, right a first, but I get really tired of it pretty quickly.  As it turns out, I don't much care for the ginger.  I think if you are partial to ginger, you will probably like these.;neutral
May be made in Scotland and using a Dundee type recipe but it is not bitter, too sweet.  Also, I do not see Seville oranges in the ingredients.;neutral
Too expensive. Go to Target and get double for about the same price. Same quality and taste.;neutral
"Not much flavor for a ""flavored"" coffee.  Would not buy again.  Gevalia Signature blend is my favorite.  Think I will stick with it.";neutral
These are definitely good.  For candy, it would be hard to find a healthier kind.  I prefer the ginger chews though.;neutral
Two out of five came unsealed. What a mess. Also unhealthy. Luckly Amazons return policy was good. The chocolate is ok. A bit sweeter than trader joes but says no sugar.;neutral
Very slow to come and not 6 boxes 200mg each, but 4 boxes 300mg each. It all worked out tho.;neutral
i normally enjoy the fiber one brownie, these were a little dry the expiration date was coming up so i'm thinking that is why, They could of been fresher.;neutral
Thought sine this seemed to actually come from England it would be better. Initial lemon taste was great but quickly devolved into a carbohydrate taste. Will try different brand next time.;neutral
"These are good, organic and yummy; but usually smaller sized, so if you're planning to peel; enlist another family memeberhaip for the job. ";neutral
Too hard. I don't like it personally.;neutral
tried it, but it's just good, not great. I like toasted sesame oil better . . . . . . .;neutral
The quality was ok - same as the basic grocery store.;neutral
The variety was good but the coffees just aren't quality sadly.;neutral
I liked this coffee. never had a colombian coffee that I didn't like, but this was not as full bodied as some and had to use more of it and grind it finer.;neutral
The flavor was good in recipe, didn't notice a difference from other brands I used.  I do a lot of baking so this TINY bottle only lasted a few weeks. I think I'll stick with Costco for the future.;neutral
I loved the taste and they slightly helped with my milk supply but it wasn't dramatically noticeable.;neutral
Not a constant baking. Not the best quality control. When not over baked or salted fabulous;neutral
Not as tasty as I expected, but good! I'm super picky as well.;neutral
this one also had the cinnamon churro, banana flake,and the oatmeal one of the coffees. Half of them  are not what I wanted or expected as could not read the labels in dispaly on Amazon.;neutral
These peppercorns did not have the savory and spicy flavor or aroma of the better products I have purchased in the past.;neutral
This is my 2nd Jo coffee purchase and this one was for me just average. It wasn't bitter but lacked aroma and flat on flavor. Im going to order a different  5 star variety next time.;neutral
Get the chocolate mint!!! It's effing amazing and no sucralose like this one. It's literally like the chocolate mint Girl Scout cookies... Cookies and cream wasn't that good;neutral
"The question is did this product meet my expectations.  Beats me; I haven't finished the last tin of Bentley's Rooibos tea, so I do not know how this product will be.  I'll let you know when I get to it.";neutral
These could  be a great as a toping for New England Clam Chowder! YET THEY ARE MADE OF WHITE FLOUR and can plug you up if you forget about eating fiber or...if you get about as much movement as a... corpse!;neutral
"Meh.  probably wouldn't order them again.  taste is ok but a very ""manufactured"" taste.  package arrived on time by the seller no complaints.  just not my favorite instant noodle option";neutral
"Half of the fingers were broken
Flavor was good, but were disappointed that
they were not good for serving guests.";neutral
This stuff came from the weird zone;neutral
Good product and price.  Would see if it benefits my health in the long run.;neutral
These pretzel nuggets have a good flavor and are MUCH softer than other brands. Your teeth will thank you.;neutral
I ordered these because I miss the Marathon bar that was out in the early '80's. These are close but not quite the same. That being said, they're still a good candy bar-just not what I was hoping for.;neutral
Make sure your water is really hot to dissolve all of the crystals;neutral
I think there was a misunderstanding or at least a misprice there is no way this small jar should cost 38 dollars.;neutral
Very small bag and not worth the price!!!;neutral
Nice dark roast but nothing special;neutral
Package arrived without my name on it and it came to work so that was not good it had been opened and several had been eaten.;neutral
prefer the coated ones like Spry, but okay.. The gum is great. I have sjorgens which means dry mouth. I chew gum or use xyitol mints all day long.;neutral
Would be better if the puffs were regular cheetos;neutral
Stronger ginger taste than the ginger chews but not bad.;neutral
Lots of kernel bits. Pop big but just a lot of debris that makes it unpleasant to chew.;neutral
"If you like kumquat you might like this berry; just a side note if you use this in a smoothies be sure to reconstitute the day before. You'll find ill blend better.";neutral
Tasty product but nuts always end up at bottom of can and not enough nuts;neutral
I have not purchased this again because I believe they have recently raised the price so I will be shopping around again I think.;neutral
Arrived on time but wrong flavor. Everything else was great. I would have given a 5 if it had been the favor it was advertising.;neutral
cheese was hard and didn't have a lot of flavor.;neutral
It's okay.  Husband likes the Clementine and APple, I like the Blackberry.  It's a nice fizzie change from soda.;neutral
I hear a lot about Bigelow Teas in commercials on the radio...I really just think this is average.  Perhaps it is due to decaffeinated nature of this tea.  But it tastes more like black tea than green.;neutral
Not really that sweet. We'll probably stick with Stevia for the most part. But the Monk Fruit will be used eventually.;neutral
Just ok, the peanut butter seems real dried out;neutral
So-so. Not the taste I was expecting. Will not order again.;neutral
not crazy about the flavor and not much for the money;neutral
Got this as a replacement for Timothy's and I do not like it.  It has a bitter taste and is too strong for me.  Disappointed.  Timothy's was much smoother.;neutral
This is just ok.  Very sweet and not really like real peach.;neutral
Kinda has a phony taste to it. Nothing like diet coke or pepsi, but it'll pass for now until something better comes out.;neutral
I love this product but sadly one or two of the bags were cut by a knife and leaked all over once I attempted to open the box that these bags came in.;neutral
Great stuff. I used to purchase this often on Amazon but the price is now too high.  I now buy it when/where I can find it at a decent price.;neutral
I love KIND bars, but not the ones with peanuts.  I guess should have read the description in detail.;neutral
OK, , & GOOD NUTRITION. FAST COOK, BUT NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS CREME OF THE WEST  (buy on ebay pk of 3);neutral
They arrived on time and in decent condition. However, my wife made the comment that she thought the flowers I've sent previously (Proflowers & FTD) were nicer.;neutral
Not much Flavor  although good for cooking for folks who don't want the coconut flavor to taste in their  Fried foods.;neutral
So so, not so good as Japanese ones.;neutral
I can find Natural Pure Premium Coconut Water at the dollar store....;neutral
I am finally finished with these K-Cups and tried another green tea k cup ..... Glad I made the switch.  There is little flavor with this brand...;neutral
very mushy the taste ok but the drying was not done properly will no buy again;neutral
While I love the taste of the original Secret Aaardvark hot sauce, I was not a fan of the black bean or jerk flavors.;neutral
Nice smooth coffee but the flavor is a bit weak.;neutral
It was just ok for me, nothing special about it.;neutral
Taste is good, size is a bit smaller than expected.;neutral
"My daughter likes the green tea and we got a good price on this brand. I noticed you have to watch the ""per cup"" price and sometimes you can get a better deal on smaller boxes.";neutral
Just average quality but ok for the low price.;neutral
I do love this coffee and this flavor, however you do need two cups if you like a little more flavor.;neutral
ok, not very impressed, get on sale;neutral
"This honey tastes about like the stuff at the grocery store, except it costs less. Doesn't have any wildflower flavor that I can detect; it's just sweet.";neutral
"For what it is, it's good.  It's not great.  It does the job, but nobody got excited and was all ""OMG, YOU GOTTA TRY THIS!""  It was more ""Enh... This is okay.""";neutral
I enjoy the ease of preparation, but , while flavorful, the taste is too bland to be really satisfying to me.;neutral
Nothing to brag about. It wasn't as rich or sweet of a flavour as expected. I was expecting something more rich and butterscotch or caramel like.;neutral
Wasn't impressed.  I know the name suggests this but it is almost like a chai tea brewed with apple cider versus water.  Not really a good combo.;neutral
This has a bit more bitter taste than other raspberry teas that I've tried but overall satisfied with performance and would buy again for a good price.;neutral
I like the Raspberry the best - this was just okay;neutral
They tend to all taste the same...but you don't know that until you try them.  Nice amount for the price too.;neutral
"These puppy seeds taste a little bitter; I've had better ...";neutral
"Arrived on time, no delay. Well packaged. Didn't tast a lot of ""Mocha"". Not a bad coffee, still trying to decide whether to put on my wish list.";neutral
It is ok but very bitter and very string smell , I though that was similar than navita brand cocoa nib ,but this is one it is very bitter maybe I should have to buying with a litter sugar or something's;neutral
Some were spoiled upon arrival, did not look as pictured on the inside.;neutral
I am not a big fan of protein powders but this one was ok -(eatable)  , I bought this one because it is low in sugar, calories and high in protein .;neutral
It's dried milk, Great shelf life for preppers boasting 20 year life,;neutral
We love this brand in our family and regularly by the sea salt and jalapeno varieties in the 36 or 72 single serve count boxes. We love the taste and love that they are GMO free.;neutral
These are delicious crackers, but don't ship well, and many end up broken in the process.;neutral
Taste good , but is hard too chew kinda dry too. Won't be ordering any more of this brand :(;neutral
Good movie but didn't like it as much as the the return of the living Dead series or Dawn of the Dead;neutral
I have used up the whole jar. it works well not the purity farm ghee taste better to me and my daughter.;neutral
Look at the date before you purchase this product. The dates expire very soon! Purchased this as a gift for my 91 year old Mother. She loves these cakes!;neutral
Over roasted, a little dry, very small, and hard to open...;neutral
I ordered these for my husband who can't eat nuts.  These bars are crunchy.  You get 3 thin wafer like things inside each package.  Not the bar I was expecting for him.  But at least he has a snack for work.;neutral
"This coconut oil melts very easily but has almost no coconut taste which is surprising for the ""finest organic extra virgin coconut oil"".... Next time I will order another brand";neutral
"Not as good as the ""cake"" products they make.  But everyone has there taste.";neutral
Love the Pineapple! Would like to get 12 Pineapple Sparkling drinks instead of a variety!;neutral
Taste Great.. Just too expensive.. get the salt and make your own.;neutral
Maple flavor was strongest, and the bacon was hardly there.;neutral
"The decaff is ok, I much prefer the donut shop decaff. I am a big time kcup addict. The Tim
regular I like much more.";neutral
I couldn't taste the jasmine.  Others said they could.  The price is good.;neutral
I love this bubble gum but you can get it cheaper at Smart & final;neutral
I like the taste of Jus by Julie better but this is good for the price, I used it for smoothies as the taste was not so much to my liking.;neutral
Freshly cooked bacon is always better! This taste okay;neutral
arrived quickly but the expiration date was 3 days from the day I received..;neutral
"WAS OK,MY FIRST CHOICE MUSSEL MANS APPLESAUCE
JUST GOT TO PRICEY.";neutral
"coffee tasted ok, but the k-cups left coffee grounds in the
coffee cup and the machine";neutral
It was tasty but damaged in the inside of my mouth, to the point where after eating a few, the inside of my mouth was peeling. I used the rest as flavoring in water.;neutral
Suppose to be really good for you but not much taste.  Definitely not a flavor enhancer but will eat for health benefits.;neutral
"It's OK.
On the whole, the ginger isn't spicy enough for me.";neutral
Despite the fact they were fused together as they melted a bit, a good biscuit with great flavor.;neutral
I BOT THIS BC OF A GD REVIEW ON A COOKING SHOW W/OUT LOOKING AT PRICE WHICH IS VERY HIGH  - I DIDN'T NOTICE MUCH DIFFERENC BT IT & OTHER BRANDS--U CAN BUY IT AT KROGERS 4 HALF OF WHAT THIS COSTS;neutral
The garlic flavor was overwhelming. Should have got the curry instead.;neutral
I use it to replace the table sugar at home. It is a good and healthy product.;neutral
I've tried a number of sugar free chocolate products and while this isn't the best, it's not the worst.  I used some in a small batch of cookies and wasn't too impressed.;neutral
They are a de rigeur addition for a Harry Potter themed party, but the kids don't really like the flavors and the boxes are small and expensive.;neutral
Where is the dark chocolate? Oh it must the color. Because there's no chocolate flavor. It has a strange sweet taste. One of the worst of the bunch. There are better flavors.;neutral
makes pretty flowers but the tea is weak at best - eh.  I've defintiely had better tea flowers  I wouldn't serve this to company and I had planned to - plans have been changed;neutral
I like the taste of the splenda brand (Nectresse) better.  I think it has something to do with the filler that makes it a 1:1 substitute for sugar.;neutral
A bit too mild. Sometimes you can't taste it at all.;neutral
This produce is not quit I expected. It tastes a lot like sweet and low. YUK. I am trying to acquire a taste for it because of health reasons;neutral
I like them but to rich and choclatly for me.;neutral
I love them, but its disappointing to receive so many of the same flavors. Many were raspberry, cherry, and strawberry.;neutral
I like these when they aren't dried out, but they get very hard very quickly. Even the unopened ones. THe flavor is good, but really don't like how hard they are.;neutral
Just ok..lots of small closed ones. Not worth busting your teeth over.;neutral
It's a middle of the road kinda of meal. I've certainly had better. Meatloaf (patty) reminded me more of a Salisbury steak. Potatoes were really good though. I would consider purchasing this again.;neutral
Acai in my book is over rated. We no longer drink them and we still feel the same and saving money.;neutral
I ordered a case of these.  I didn't really care for them.  HOWEVER!  One of my daughters who is really healthy conscious thought they were wonderful.  She is into raw foods, clean eating.  She took them all.;neutral
Bought this to lower my blood pressure. Not sure if it works yet but the taste is a bit boring!;neutral
bought through Amazon Fresh, the crab is fresh but small package and a little watery. Does not compare to frozen(yuck). I would buy again;neutral
I was excited to try this as it is supposed to be a great flavor of tea. I was rather disappointed. It tastes to me much like a normal orange pekoe.;neutral
I ordered to put in my coffee. A little too bitter for my taste. Have not tried any other drinks yet. Wanting to try in an orange liquor next.;neutral
tastes like oreo outside not cocoa to me;neutral
Just OK!  Nothing fantastic at all.;neutral
Weaker than some Grade B syrups I've had. Not sure I'll reorder it again.;neutral
Good product. Why did you have to increase price by $13?;neutral
I used to use this a lot for iced coffee and now have been trying other natural sweeteners instead of artificial ones. It takes good for iced coffee.;neutral
Pretty cool item, but 2 out of 3 of us didn't like these at all. I am the only one who didn't spit it out., but the color is off putting,  so I'd probably not order again.;neutral
Again, these beans are ok, but a bit pricey.  I just can't find satisfactory Kona anywhere;neutral
They taste more like tea than soda syrup.;neutral
Too greasy tasting and not all of the kernals popped.  Better value with Kirkwood Brand, IMHO, but I don't have a Costco nearby.;neutral
This is ok. I liked their older formula a lot better...felt it was healthier and I lost weight quicker with it.  Not sure I would buy this again.;neutral
perfect if you love batbacue chips!;neutral
I do really like the taste, but it doesn't last for very long, unfortunately!;neutral
Product was as described and delivered on time.  The candy itself is very tasty.  Sucking on one is like drinking a coffee from Starbucks.;neutral
I purchased this as an alternative to alcohol-based vanilla extract, but it doesn't add much flavor. I've gone back to using alcohol-free vanilla extract in uncooked dishes.;neutral
Was a little disappointed - not much seafood in it.  Soup was tasty and I guess if you add extra fish or seafood to it it might be better.  Haven't tried that yet.  Jean;neutral
Great flavor! Doesn't dissolve in liquid that well.;neutral
Cravings return with vengeance and, if not careful, you would get regular nose bleeds.;neutral
Used for my animals but packed in water is better this has lots of salt.;neutral
The candy is great. The problem is with the delivery. The package was hot and the candy melted. 2nd time this has happened. Your customer service has helped both times this has happened;neutral
Tastes great but not the original product as pictured.;neutral
Good price but I've had way more flavorful Vanilla Extract before. This just doesn't deliver the great taste I received from another product I used but could no longer find.;neutral
Reliable product for those of us who must eat spinach every day. Not as good as fresh, but I always keep half a dozen cans of POPEY for those California rainy weeks. Reliable!;neutral
I prefer the other ones these have a slight aftertaste to them I will buy them again if I have no choice but the other half and halfs are better taste better than these.;neutral
Not as sweet as I would have hoped but not bad.;neutral
good product but its price has gone up, not the best deal compared to similar products;neutral
Wish the original Fritos Corn Chips were on the Subscribe, and Save option with Amazon.  These chips are really no cheaper than a grocery store, just convenient to receive them at home.;neutral
I do not consider these to be mild.  They are hotter than I prefer.;neutral
Came in busted.  Granular were powdery but that's all I can say.  Returned them.;neutral
More of a hassle than K-cups, but the coffee is good. Wished they carried DE in K-cups.;neutral
I was bummed that so many of them did not work. :(;neutral
Strawberry daiquiri is great and the other two start to grow on you;neutral
flavor is weak and price is too high;neutral
sparse filling-- dried a bit--not as received prior to this year;neutral
Product and price are great. Arrived with a small whole in bag so had to move to different container so docked 2 stars for that.;neutral
Not as intense or authentic strawberry flavor as I had expected. Takes twice as much as other brands to get a good flavor.;neutral
not the best i've ever had. i was pretty disappointed.;neutral
Found this coffee rather strong and bitter.  Reminds me of Community Coffee that I had to drink in Louisiana and hated!;neutral
First time eating raw chocolate. Tastes terrible but I believe all of it does. Supposed to be very healthy;neutral
LIKE THE COFFEE BUT THEY ARE ALL LOOSE IN THE CARTON SO DIFFICULT TO STORE;neutral
taste is wonderful.  think I'm allergic to it.;neutral
Too sweet, not hot at all, seem very fatty. This is not the hunters sausage like you get at the party store. Tense we're just not what I expected. Dog loves them though so he will be eating theses as treats.;neutral
Does the job when i can't brush my teeth at work.  It's gum.;neutral
Like the bigger bags better, either you like them or you don't. They just don't have that snap as they use to as I remember.;neutral
Good quality and convenient (great for backpacking if you need oil) but at nearly a dollar a packet they are a bit expensive for what you get in my opinion.;neutral
This coffee does not have much chocolate or raspberry taste.  It is OK as a regular coffee but not as a flavored coffee.;neutral
"Probably won't buy again; just didn't seem fresh.";neutral
The seeds are great, if you don't mind products from China. My concern is that China has different regulations regarding its organic products.;neutral
Ok product. Have some issues with smell, it is rather chemical not buttery as clarified butter has. But so far all chicken and fisher fried on this ghee are good and tasty. .;neutral
My only dislike is that it's not in a glass bottle.;neutral
Not much taste and found lots of stems compared to other brands.;neutral
Sweet but not distinctive in flavor. Will try something else next order.;neutral
These have more sugar than pop tarts.;neutral
"Overall a good product, but there is a bit of ""imitation sugar"" taste to it.";neutral
Made from milk, not as rich as those discs that come with cappuccino or latte packages.;neutral
Disappointed. Not so great taste. Won't buy anymore butter pecan ground coffee. I'll have to try another flavor. Very popular flavor is Hazelnut.;neutral
Personally, I did not feel this tasted like outback's seasoning.  It is ok.;neutral
Taste's ok, but has the consistency of water.  The pump also causes it to splash out, so if you try to add it to your cup on top of your coffee or tea, you'll have sticky splashes to clean up.;neutral
pricey and goes bad quick.  some fruit already bad when it arrived.;neutral
that I opted to throw out for safety.  So there went my savings by ordering a case of 24.  Live, and learn.;neutral
tasty but again overpriced in comparison to store pricing;neutral
that's it: it's ok. I would not recommend it.;neutral
Its a packaged meal that heats in a minute. What can you truly expect.;neutral
More than half the bag was bad or stale!  Very disappointed.  Such a good deal that I was so hoping they would be good.;neutral
Gums loose their taste after few chews, will not reorder.;neutral
Unusual sweetness, not unpleasant, just unusual.;neutral
Didn't realize it was soy based. I'm very allergic to soy.;neutral
This is a good shortbread but NOT as good as Lorna Doone, I thought it would be better plus you get a very small amount of cookies. So disappointed!;neutral
The product is fine - it was too earthy for me;neutral
I was hoping this would taste the same as Talkin Blues Marley coffee, but not even close.  I thought this was a little on the bitter side and not as smooth as Talkin Blues.  Personally I won't buy this again.;neutral
the seller put this in a bag in summer when i open it it was all one giant chocolate almond that turned white. it went diectly to the trash and i was refunded. buy in winter you will be happy;neutral
It is sorta good but prefer another brand.;neutral
The taste is okay, but it is weak in my opinion.  I have been putting two bags in my cup of tea and still can hardly taste it.  I like strong tea, but if you like a weaker tea then this tastes pretty good.;neutral
These are okay.  They have a artificial after taste.  Most likely will not order these again.;neutral
I like to eat this dry, with no milk. The apples are very dry. However, if hot milk was added, I believe this would be yummy.;neutral
Tasty but not a lot of food for the money.;neutral
Could Barley Taste the Maple at all.  Find better maple syrup ele where.;neutral
I didn't taste any of the toffee in this bar.  I barely even tasted the peanut butter.  It's not one I would recommend or purchase again.;neutral
"It's an odd texture; like chewing on gel.  No taste itself.  I guess if you're looking for a low calorie/carb ingredient, this would work.";neutral
This is a pretty potent Early Grey, and I think for Early Grey lovers it will do nicely, it was just a little too strong for me;neutral
It's okay.  A little smoke, a little flavor.  I thought I detected a slight bitter edge but that may be desirable in some dishes.;neutral
Not much mango flavor. Not something I would buy again.;neutral
More menthol than licorice. Tasty enough, but not everyone is going to like these.;neutral
I was expecting something really special from some of the reviews.  I'm not sure if I will order again or not.;neutral
These are the small ones I was expecting 24 long ones!;neutral
Ugh!  I'm used to drinking coffee with REAL cream, and I thought I would try these.  Tasted so artificial....but that's my fault for ordering them.;neutral
Couldn't really experience the Youpon because there were too many additives.;neutral
Doesn't give me the rich espresso taste I crave, the beans do not show the oils that quality coffee does.;neutral
Not as good as the Chinese restaurant tea!;neutral
Just thought I was going to get more.  Made a hasty decesion to buy this product.  Not worth the money spent.  See providence pantry meats for a cheaper deal on quality canned meat.;neutral
I've had this quite a while, but am still not really sure why. Hope to find a good use for it soon.;neutral
The popcorn was tasteless.  I was disappointed.;neutral
Just ok. Pricey for taste and being satisfied. Disappointed.;neutral
"These are ok. One of the few ""protein bars"" that is light and not too dense, like most of the others. Although the vanilla taste is very sweet and a little bit artificial/chemically tasting.";neutral
Thought would be more Citrus tasting . Since its Tropical Fruit. I love Celestial teas, this one caffeine free which works for me. Just taste required sweetener !;neutral
PPopcorn jar lid was crushed. Entire contents in shipping box and on front porch.  Hope the squirrels and birds find it.;neutral
While this tea tasted okay, it is a bit too bitter for me.  Will use with lemon and sweets, but will not repurchase.;neutral
it was ok, nothing to write home about.  Won't purchase again.  The Cafe Artigiano cap's won't work in the machine and always get an error.;neutral
Theres an odd chemical taste to these. Better to just buy regular almond butter and mix in cocoa powder or sugar-free chocolate chips. Disappointing for such an expensive product.;neutral
no big deal on this tea, pricey not well boxed and taste was not there for how it was advertised.;neutral
quality and packaging good/can get much cheaper at supermarket like walmart;neutral
"Appeared to arrive only 2/3 full; this may be due to settling, or not.

I didn't seem to get as many servings as the label said.";neutral
its okay coffee not as bold aas i thought it would be;neutral
I guess from all the hype I expected much more flavor. Very dry and bland. Ended up throwing most of them away. Sorry I made the mistake of ordering 2 packages. What a waste.;neutral
I usually use the sweet leaf brand. I wanted to try because this one is cheaper. I had to use more drops to obtain flavor of my other brand.;neutral
"I really wanted to love this...but I don't.  The flavor is just ""off"".  It's not awful...it's just not very good.";neutral
"Very well packaged and individually double layered; however the taste is not what we expected - overly sweet, some flavors taste funny";neutral
This beverage is way too expensive for my budget, and I wasn't impressed with the flavor. I won't be reordering.;neutral
Didn't really like the flavoring for my popcorn and would recommend the Great Northern Popcorn flavoring instead. This left a weird after taste even more so after a day after putting it on popcorn.;neutral
There were more smooshed crackers than in a normal box of Ritz.;neutral
just ok they have other flavors that are much better;neutral
The Lobster Bisque has a nice flavor, but I won't buy it again. Just my personal preference.;neutral
Smells pretty bad, tastes worse. It tastes like coffee with a bitter aftertaste. I'll drink the stuff I bought but  it's pretty horrible and I don't recommend it. Will not buy again.;neutral
If you are used to regular store pasta, this has a different taste.  I can't say I don't like, but it is different.  If you HAVE to be gluten free it is probably wonderful, but I can stick to store brands.;neutral
These were okay. I've had better classic meatballs though. They'll do in a pinch.;neutral
Not very sweet. Could be personal taste. Would not reorder.;neutral
Really salty tasting, but I guess that's makes movie theater popcorn so good, right? Well... it definitely has the taste of theater popcorn, but can be overpowering if you use too much. Approach with caution.;neutral
It is OK, but it is candy, really, with some fruit puree.;neutral
Chocolate is good. But I will look around for another source of chocolate chips. I would feel better about buying from Nestle if I was sure that the cocoa hadn't been harvested by child slaves in West Africa.;neutral
"After seeing recommended on Chefs corner I thought I would try.
It lacks the character and zip I was looking for.
Not a bad product but not worth the investment.";neutral
Tasteless, hard/tough. No reorder here!!;neutral
It tastes pretty good but you can't use it as a marinade or even cook with it because it makes the meat tougher than normal. Won't buy again.;neutral
The taste is nice, the HEAT is nice, the saltiness is a bit much. VERY salty. I'm afraid I won't be able to use as much of this at one time as I would like for flavor as it makes my panang way too salty.;neutral
Product as described and arrived on time and undamaged.;neutral
I love halva, but these flavors did nothing for me.  The one I thought I'd like the most, (pistachio) was the actually the worst.  From now on, I'll just stick with the plain.;neutral
okay option for after dinner! With a pleasant thank you note. Nice.;neutral
I enjoy this product the taste was fresh and e all the military enjoyed it. Great Taste  Next  time bigger box;neutral
Too sweet! Didn't care for it too much.;neutral
"Decent, but nothing stellar.
Peanut butter flavor is lacking.";neutral
I only gave a 3 star rating because even though it was good, it wasn't really sour enough for me.  Also, the shipping cost are more than the product is worth.;neutral
Very unique.  It does not pop up like our usual popcorn.  There are no residue husks, which is good.  It is a tasty treat.;neutral
This coffee sampler, as the description states had some crazy flavors.  It is good for those who like different flavors, but not my cup of coffee.  Vendor delivered on time as promised.;neutral
Not a big fan, I love Folgers morning blend coffee but the instant just doesn't taste great.  I usually drink my coffee black, but I have to add cream to this.;neutral
These are similar to cinnamon toast crunch but about 75% less sweet.  I prefer the sweetness of cinnamon toast crunch so I was disappointed in the taste of these.;neutral
Great flavor but disappointed in size;neutral
hate the powder, like the granulated but it was my mistake;neutral
I wouldnt consider the taste comparable to a Jolly Rancher, but there is a subtle hint of apple. Wont be buying this flavor again in the future.;neutral
Cilantro is visible, but I can't taste it.;neutral
The lack of robust flavor in this soup was surprising for a Campbell's soup.  I expected more from them.  Pretty spicy but not in a tasty way.;neutral
Apparently I missed the part that said these are not freeze dried fruit. Even though they are all natural, the gummie texture is not one of my favorites.;neutral
The selection was not that great for the products like this that I like.;neutral
Kind of expensive for what it is, but I like that it's not just overladen with sugar and my daughter does like it.;neutral
Not bad.. It's mostly a fat based broth.  Wouldn't buy again.;neutral
Flavor is OK, but still a little bitter even when only steeping for less than a minute. Maybe a drop of lemon will make it better. I'll continue to buy due to how it's manufactured.;neutral
i was disappointed with this cinnamon it did not smell very nice;neutral
Not near salty enough! As compared to P.R. I will use it up adding my own popcorn salt blended in but then it's back to the real deal!;neutral
If you love peanut butter above all else, this is the box for you.  Only one or two packs that weren't peanutty.;neutral
"it sounds healthy and it's ok to try
I guess they probably dehydrate the zucchini and the flavor was good, but the chip tasted funny";neutral
Not as fruity as some other Ancho powders;neutral
I was expecting a more flavorful taste such as the hazelnut blend(which I liked very much) but this wasn't very tasty to me. Won't be ordering this again.;neutral
Bought these to try them. Didn't really like the flavors,;neutral
To begin, these crackling were not bad, just nothing special. The bags are kind of small for the price and the product were more like pork skins than crackling. I will not be ordering again.;neutral
Just okay for me. I find many of the flavors to sweet. The banana one was actually my favorite;neutral
Pretty good but better , bolder deals are out there;neutral
"This green tea is much too weak compared to Twinnings's K-cups.

There is a little dust at the bottom of the cup with these. Too bad it had no taste.";neutral
They were a little too spicie for me.;neutral
It's a little too mild.  I guess I thought I was getting a bold Kona-blend type taste.;neutral
I'm trying to get used to drinking this tea but it tastes like I'm drinking tree bark.  Time will tell if I develop a taste for it.  I did receive my order quickly though.;neutral
I did not like this at all.  No matter what you do it comes out GUMMY!  I tried three different methods and could not get it to come out the way I wanted it.  Finally threw out what was left.;neutral
It was OK, but there is better organic coffee out there.;neutral
This cracker tasted better then I expected have not had these's in years. Got to get more some place else notice the price changed for the higher since I bought them in the last month.;neutral
I am sure this matcha tea tastes just fine for people who like the taste of matcha. Unfortunately, I do not like the taste at all. I really wanted to like it but it is just too bitter for my liking.;neutral
My favorite Chocolate Swirl flavor has been discontinued, so I'm on the hunt for a new fave.  This was kinda disappointing.  No chocolate flavor.  Probably won't buy it again.;neutral
It's OK. but the price is high for this.;neutral
Its more salty than Morton but has larger granules so does not stick to food as well;neutral
Bought it for spraying on dogs food to repel fleas.  1 spray will give my dog soft stool.  It does smell very strong.  I might try it for repelling Mosquitos on the deck:);neutral
It was ok.  Nothing to get excited about though.;neutral
"The ratio of innards to chocolate is lower then with the full-size cream eggs; if that's what you're looking for, then these are the best for you";neutral
I will try another zylitol next. This did not work in cooking and did not dissolve quick enough.  The taste is good.;neutral
These nuts were okay, not the flavor I was looking for.  I cannot say what is missing, but they are good, but not quit the old fashion flavor I was looking for.;neutral
LOVE this product.  Love the pulp.  But now is more than twice as expensive as the same product without pulp.  .;neutral
These work well if you cook them right away. Dont let them sit for more than a couple days in the fridge.;neutral
Good, but did not like the flax.  Others were great;neutral
the cereal has a different texture than any others I've had, like chocolate or berry.  kind of reminds me of rice crispies.  I think i'll stick to my favorite special k and order chocolate from now on.;neutral
The flavor was good but I guess I am just a carmel corn lover the most.  However my Aunt Loved it!!!;neutral
The flavor is very odd. Not bad. I think it would be good on chicken wings. We used it on burgers this weekend and it wasn't so great.;neutral
these Stevia Drops are alright!.... they can be really sweet if you add to much they don't taste like much to me i'll probably save it for baking;neutral
not sure why everybody raves over this tea...it was just ok to me;neutral
CHEATER!! Not even 5lbs = Received 4lbs 15ozs plus thick, heavy bag = ???lbs.;neutral
Bought for my nephews' Halloween bags. It's cute. It's different. Good value.;neutral
I quite enjoy it, though I do admit it does not compare to real peppermint syrup.;neutral
I like the cherry better.  It has to be really cold to taste the best.;neutral
A little bland, but I am drinking it with the almased powder so it is very convenient and portable.  I would order again for the convenience factor.;neutral
Most of the flavors are pretty good, but not particularly strong.;neutral
Cans were too large for my taste, would rather use the smaller cans for lunches and snacks;neutral
Hard to know how to use this flour. Think it is cool that they have come up with an alternative to but flours and grain flours just wish recipes were easier to find.;neutral
16 0z for 8.95 is over priced to say the least. taste great though. Hard not to buy again ,they were yummy.;neutral
Not the greatest peppermint flavor.;neutral
Works well in vegan recipes, but alone it's pasty and tasteless;neutral
As in all gluten free products the maker of same has you by the curly ! so if you must have a piece of bread  YOU ARE GOING TO PAY THROUGH THE NOSE !!!!;neutral
"It's probably ok even good for
 Other people. We didn't care for it, the dogs didn't eat it";neutral
I'll take my chances with msg if i can just get a little more flavor. Look at the crazy price for this stuff .... double what other stuff is and the other stuff tastes better.;neutral
This aren't too bad for low carb diet.  I probably will not buy again.;neutral
"This mustard is good, but is not extremely good nor does it have a unique taste that warrants the price.

I've had higher end grocery store mustards that are comparable.";neutral
Some of the jerky treats were excellent, some so-so, some you would only enjoy if you were into very spicy. I threw those out.;neutral
Price first purchased was $4.95 then jumped to over $7.  I stopped buying it at that price - coffee good, but not that good.;neutral
The Soy Sauce packets are fine but not particularly flavorful.;neutral
These taste good but seem to spoil rapidly.;neutral
nice product taste alright, not very strong for a strong taste add peppermint oil;neutral
Okay price but not a huge quantity for the price;neutral
dark tea, rather light flavor.  i thought i would try something other my standbys, english and irish breakfast.  the taste is also lighter than earl grey.;neutral
Not that many onions or mushrooms in each can. It is okay, but not worth high price.;neutral
I love the flavor, but the nuts are held together so strongly and the bar is so hard that it's easy to chip a tooth if you're not careful.;neutral
Not bad but a bit too much garlic for my tastes.  But if you enjoy lots of garlic, then this is for you.  Prepares fast and easy.;neutral
doesen't taste as good as expected.  popcorn somewhat small after it is pop.;neutral
THESE ARE MUCH EASIER TO CHEW THAN THE HARIBO SUGAR FREE GUMMI BEARS HOWEVER THEY LACK THE FLAVOR.  I DON'T THINK I WOULD REPURCHASE.;neutral
Although I like jovial's checkerboard cookies and their ginger cookies, I don't care much for their fig cookies.  They have an odd taste and are a bit on the dry side.  I probably won't order again.;neutral
to strong for my tastes but i knew it would be stronger than i like normally.;neutral
Maybe the can affects the taste. I don't notice it so much, but my wife thought it was rancid. I felt it might have a metallic taste.;neutral
This fruit spread is good, but not exceptional.  I would not purchase it again.;neutral
Was not flavorful. Did not really like it tastewise. Sorry.;neutral
I didn't get very many for the price.  It still tastes like veggies...blah!  I thought it would make eating veggies easier.;neutral
Not as tasty as expected (spoiled by Planters, but thought this would be less costly).;neutral
Pretty nice sampler. The peppermint tea has a very strong smell.;neutral
This is a little on the weak side, and the taste is not bad but could be more coconut-y. It's the best I've found but...the dream lives on.;neutral
They were good just not really pickled more salty;neutral
Cookies were great, but the tin had a big dent in the side.;neutral
they change the packing, but did they also change the formula, it tastes different than before, very lighter, and bitter.;neutral
Yeah, its not homemade and its not Kraft either but if you want a good healthy, celiac safe choice this is IT.  You can add parmesan and butter to it to give it more flavor.;neutral
These are the hottest food I have ever eaten.  Too Hot.  AAAhhhhh OOhhh OOOO.  I like Penrose pickled sausages a lot better.;neutral
did not like the taste of these at all... glad to be done with the bag and won't be getting these again.;neutral
Sweeter than I expected. I really wish sugar wasn't added. The tea leaves are so small that you don't mind drinking them.;neutral
The texture was good, but it was much too sweet for our tastes.  Couldn't finish it.;neutral
they were ok but hurt your throat unlike other kitkats was quite odd;neutral
I often buy the lime & lemon and saw this and wanted to try...granted it has stevia but it is suppppeeer tart.  I like sour but wow!  I had to add more water to even out the flavor;neutral
Didn't taste as yummy as I would think, but only made one batch so far.;neutral
These used to be stunningly good.  They have done something to make them good but more ordinary in quality. ...;neutral
"PAUL NEWMAN should stick with spaghetti sauce.  This brand of popcorn is lackluster and leaves nothing to write home about.  I got it because it costs less ... now I know why.  It's only  ""okay""";neutral
Just a wee bit sweet, so I set the size on small and add a few extra cubes of ice. Weakens the flavor a bit, but it is fairly strong anyway.;neutral
Good flavor but the pods are smaller than I expected, don't last long enough for me needs.;neutral
It's ok, plenty of veggies but it needs more pepper or something to bring out some more flavor.  A bit on the bland side.;neutral
it's a bit too acidic. We were buying Gavina Espresso brand and LOVED it.  I hope they bring it back to Amazon.;neutral
bought sesame teriyaki first, so tried this maple bacon. can't tell the bacon taste, but the flavor is not attractive at all.;neutral
very good, love the taste, but veryexpensive;neutral
It tastes very salty almost. It came with a booklet with DVD in the box, and I think I saw that it had a lot of chlorine. I think that's what is contributing to the taste.;neutral
Prefer Xylitol, but the product came intact and as advertised;neutral
It is sure a lot of candy.....hmmm  good and tasty.;neutral
They were stale but I still enjoyed them.;neutral
Tastes good, but very sweet and is sticky. Sticks to my teeth. I prefer firmer fruit snacks and so will buy a different brand next time.;neutral
Okay flavor.  The chicken stock tastes better.  I know bone broth has higher mineral content.  I decided to make my own.;neutral
good  but I am clumsy sohave hard time withany brand  of the little creamers. Tsdtes great with thepumpkin spice flavored coffee k-cups.;neutral
Good enough vanilla, but  I think I will stick with the vanilla extract in the liquid form for my baking;neutral
This trail mix was mostly dried fruits with just a few almonds and walnut pieces.;neutral
Not crazy about this skipjack tuna.  Tastes strong and sour to me.  Husband says it's okay.;neutral
Didn't give me anymore of a kick than normal coffee, but everyone else really seems to like it at work.;neutral
N ah....wouldn't buy again. It just doesn't taste as good as the ones  you buy from restaurants where it is made fresh;neutral
I was looking for salt for my salt grinder.  I am not accustomed to buying these gourmet salts already ground.;neutral
While these aren't bad, they are, in the end, just instant potatoes.  They tend to be a little dry but the flavor is okay.  Probably won't buy again but for some, these might be perfect.;neutral
contains maltodextrin, and it, therefore, tastes funny.;neutral
Bought the Kick Ass kind first and my husband swears it was some of the best coffee he's ever had.  Tried 454 this time around and it does not kick ass, so to speak. It's good, but not remarkable.;neutral
Good as a gag-gift, but rather large to be practical. There'd be a hospital-visit in your future if you sat down and ate the whole thing at once. Took our family 2-3 weeks to consume.;neutral
A little disappointed.  Not great flavor. I would not buy this again.;neutral
it tastes pretty good and i would use the entire bottle but probably won't buy it again.  i'll stick with soda stream and the root beer;neutral
Tastes okay, not as good as Vita.  I like the Tetra packs and they travel well, but the water is just okay.;neutral
Great flavor but really awful aroma.;neutral
This is a good product, but I was overcharged.  The expiration date is too close from the purchase price.;neutral
Its not the wonderful taste of mighty heirloom popcorn so I won't be purchasing again. I will say the kernals pop up nice and fluffy, jsut that the taste is not what I prefer;neutral
So much dirt in the bunch I received;neutral
I found this coffee kind of boring. No wow factor at all. And the grind was so fine that we had mud in the bottom of our pot. We had to brew it with a paper filter inside a permanent filter.;neutral
"I have lived in colonial Mexico for 11.5 years and was not impressed with these.
Avoid!";neutral
Was really hoping to recreate Starbucks Mojito teas and I cannot get the flavor to be the same even using syrups.;neutral
Ok taste, some aftertaste.  Acceptable coffee.  It doesn't need to be stronger, it just needs to not have that aftertaste.;neutral
These are fine, but I really want the one that tastes more like butter.;neutral
"Great product !!!
But not enough product to rationalize the 30 dollar price tag. Won't be purchasing again until the price drops significantly.";neutral
"I ordered from them twice and I won't be ordering from them again; both times five k-cups wouldn't work in my HB FlexBrew.  The variety wasn't exactly what was shown.";neutral
These are worth getting once for a challenge that's it.;neutral
Order arrived on 1/6/17, best buy date is 1/7/17... not planning on eating this whole box in one day. Disappointing.;neutral
I really like the regular Caribou blend but the Daybreak was meh. I'll continue to buy the regular one and skip the Daybreak from now on.;neutral
Not that thrilled.  It doesn't dissolve as well as my perk  whole milk.  It's OK but I won't be reordering;neutral
It's tomato paste in a tube. What else can be said? Pricing is not competitive (at all) but it's a difficult product to find in my area.;neutral
It's ok.  Does have a Pina Colada taste to it.;neutral
Ok, but didn't have quite the natural mint taste I wanted.;neutral
Best tea I've ever had but the bags tastes faintly of paper, so I always buy the sachets now!;neutral
Wanted to try. Taste was great and fresh. Shipping was awesome. Family still prefers Coffee Crisp.;neutral
Tasty but very little in the bag. Yes, they print their net ounces, but that is hard to relate to until you see it.;neutral
hard, not as salty as expected, kinda plain.  gave all the bags to a friend who loved them.;neutral
I'm not that crazy about okra to begin with. My husband liked and ate them.;neutral
very good - except all but 10 were crumbled - someone needs to invent new type of packaging....but, the taste was as good as ever....;neutral
You get what you pay for with candy.  This is O.K., but not gourmet.;neutral
I didn't expected the package made of cheap clear plastic material, I won't be able to use this as a gift.;neutral
The company (not Amazon) sent the wrong size package.  Actually the Classic Dallmayr coffee is too mild.  The regular one is better.;neutral
I thought I was going to get non flavored bold to medium roast coffees but it appears that there are more flavored ones.;neutral
We love how it tastes, but it doesn't pop so well. Maybe operator error...?;neutral
I am intolerant to gluten, so can't use now.  Gave it to my neighbors.  They were happy.;neutral
This was much smaller than I expected. It had good flavor, but I suppose just wasn't what we were used to. I probably would not purchase again.;neutral
To much for one person to eat. But delicious.;neutral
It clumps together more than other rubbed sage I have had. I wonder if there is a trick to getting it not to clump?;neutral
Flavor is good, but leaves an aftertaste, likely the stevia.  Should offer a version without any sweetener at all.;neutral
They would serve a great purpose if they were still hard after putting them in a pot of soup...  Never again;neutral
"way too sweet for ""intense dark"", hazelnut pieces too tiny";neutral
The taste is horrible. I'm not sure if I'm preparing it incorrectly but it just tastes bad.;neutral
I was not real satisfied with the pecan flavor. I enjoy coffee in the morning and this is better than buying at a coffee store, I just didn't like this flavor.;neutral
I was disappointed that this coffee tasted about the same as the coffee I buy at the supermarket and make in my ordinary coffeepot.;neutral
Husband loves these cookies - but the price is prohibitive, so I do only buy them once as a treat for him.;neutral
I was expecting bleached almonds.  These came bleached and roasted, making them a bit bitter.  Disappointing.;neutral
Unfortunately it contains some pork, which I missed when purchasing, other than that it's fine.;neutral
I don't  understad how or why this soup gets such favorable reviews. I find it to be bland and the potato/clam ratio is much too high.;neutral
Ok product...not that much better than what can be bought at grocery store.  Tastes are very subtle.;neutral
"Like my son said when he took a sip, ""I feel like my tongue just licked a fish.""  This tea tastes just like fish - at least to our tastes.  Maybe all Japanese tea tastes like this?";neutral
I wanted to like this coffee because it's organic and I think coffee is a highly sprayed crop usually.  Figured it would be good to eliminate the pesticides, but the flavor just isn't what I like.;neutral
It was just okay. The clams didn't really have much flavor.;neutral
Disappointed in the taste and probably won't purchase again.;neutral
When soaking these,  there were too many that floated to the top which means it has gone bad.  I would like to get fresher tiger nuts at the price I am paying.  Otherwise they were okay.;neutral
These tasted good but cost too much for me.;neutral
Great tea holder and steam keeper. It does what it saids;neutral
This is good coffee but too expensive.  Go to store and invest in less expensive foo foo coffee.  Put the difference in trip jar.;neutral
These are okay. They taste kind of like an under-cooked cookie. They aren't very big, like a large fig bar. Not as good as they look on package, but not bad. I won't buy again. The Cranberry are much better!;neutral
This is just ok out of other seaweed brands I have had they are rubbery not the best flavor but what a deal as far as price goes probably won't be buying again;neutral
Not a lot of coffee flavor. Could definitely add a boost with that. Can only use this if I add it to black coffee as a creamer.;neutral
I am not a big fan of cereal but it is nice to have it at the house.  Both my husband and my kid likes this.  I personally prefer protein shake for breakfast.;neutral
Not bad but not memorable. Awesome that amazon delivers this.;neutral
Not as flavorful as I had hoped. Nice aroma tho.;neutral
Good but not much in the can. Expensive for how much you get;neutral
We didn't like these too much. Nothing wrong just,not our favorite.;neutral
I would say as far as the taste they didn't meet the expectation of haribo candy. I love the fruit salad ones, they have a better taste. These were cute but that's about it, the taste was meh..nothin special.;neutral
Not as malty or deep flavor. Maybe I'd try Irish Breakfast next round.;neutral
"These are fantastic. I hope they really are sugar free. Very good candy.

Update: Make sure eat these while sitting on the toilet or close to one, Sugar alcohol gives you instant explosive diarrhea.";neutral
No instructions were included as to how to cook the package contents.  I had to guess and it took some time before I got it right.;neutral
Flavors are a bit strange, but not totally off-putting.  I got these to use for my gyros meat in an area that has no access to lamb.;neutral
The coffee flavor was ok but you really couldn't taste any pumpkin.  The coffee was too strong for my taste.;neutral
Good but a little to spicy for me. I will use them with other teas in combination for short brew but not as a solo brew;neutral
Organic and no GMO - just what I was looking for.  Resulted in the smallest popped kernels and hard also.  Not the result I was looking for.;neutral
I thought this would be a healthy snack, but it ended up being not very filling for the calorie-count. Delicious, but not worth the price or the calories, unforch.;neutral
They all tasted the same! Some texture differences is all that differentiated the pieces in the collection. Over priced for very small pieces. Skip the collection stick with the truffles;neutral
Great stuff, however it is ridiculous cost. Will look for something else.;neutral
love this candy but i can't eat  sure the kids liked them;neutral
Same quick pizza making, but the crust wasn't as good as current pizza products...frozen and delivery.;neutral
Good but I don't like the price. For that reason I'm hesitant to purchase again.;neutral
Wanted to like it, really thought I could trust the reviews, just doesn't have the right consistency (too thick) or flavor (more of a tomato paste flavor than pizza sauce).;neutral
not bad, ive had worse...a good little snack to have.;neutral
Great taste gluten free granola bars but the price is getting too high.;neutral
Just novel. Paid waaaay too much but they're okay;neutral
Good flavor, but can use very little as salt is still very high.;neutral
Fentiman's still the best.  but F is 2.50, per 8 oz....  and hard to find.;neutral
Not worth the hype nothing special won't buy again.;neutral
They have a good amount of protein, but the carb count is higher than I would like.  Also so over the top sweet, like eating a candy bar, which I don't eat since trying to kick the sugar habit.;neutral
This is a very good product, but for my taste they were just iffy. The price was very good I just wanted to give them a try. I gave them to a friend and, they enjoyed them very much.;neutral
Since I had to switch to Decaf and I like strong Dark Coffee I've been searching, This Did Not meet that, like most Decafs I've tried very little flavor.;neutral
Not much flavor - must be enhanced with something, like salt and oil. PB2 is better;neutral
They were okay.  I am partial to the coconut.;neutral
"Disappointed in the lack of salt in these nuts. This product as labeled is usually tasty. I did not want ""lightly salted"" and chose carefully when ordering. Am thinking of asking for a refund.
A";neutral
Yes price per pound is less than my usual supply source (see my reviews for name of preferred almond company) but almonds were not fresh and bag was dirty and ripped apart when I opened it.;neutral
well didn't like the grainy feeling to the dough Chewy too and just didn't fit well with me. some one might like it that likes a chewy cake!;neutral
If you expect top quality, sorry, this product is about like drug store candy.  Not fresh, not smooth, not Sees, nor is it as good as the quality Giaradelli. It is candy though.;neutral
Where the product is pretty good, about 10% of the contents were busted open and unuseable.;neutral
I am not an organic person and the flavor takes some getting used to;neutral
Eh, not my favorite.  I generally love Numi teas but this was a disappointment.  I much prefer Rishi Masala chai to this but, of course, it's 3x the price of the Numi.;neutral
I think it might be worth the trouble to add your own milk rather than use this.  Fair.;neutral
I didn't care much for them as the seeds tasted rancid.;neutral
I really expected more from an expensive organic coffee, it was alright. Took it on a hiking trip.;neutral
I like the pasta, hate the orientation discrimination. I don't think I'll be a customer in the future.;neutral
I'm giving to somebody at work, didn't care for taste or texture;neutral
A nice product, but it tastes just ever so slightly burnt.  Not offensive or bad.  It just is mildly perceptible.  I would recommend it.;neutral
almost stale in texture but great flavor and price for quantity;neutral
Didn't care for these, not much distinct flavor. Just sweet.;neutral
the taste was good,  the amount received was great but slabs were too thin which caused the jerky to be very tough.;neutral
These are good as a snack, with a variety of flavors that for me are a bit intense as compared with pop-corners. Still, an enjoyable variation;neutral
These are ok and small.  I would rather eat a small bite of the real thing vs this little treat.  It isn't terrible but in my opinion, not worth the points!;neutral
It's okay for me, nothing really special but healthy snacks so that's something;neutral
Takes hours to work but it does work.;neutral
Guess not quite what we expected. Salty and good on some things.;neutral
They taste great, but I mine arrived out of the box with 3 damaged bars.;neutral
Gum has a Big Bang on the front but then quickly loses its flavor over time;neutral
It's good, good idea. To much sugar nearly the full daily recommend amount for females.;neutral
These were delicious. I would've given them five stars, but I always got migraines after eating them.;neutral
I thought this would've tasted better than it did. Smelled stronger than it tasted. Wouldn't buy again. It's not bad, just not what I was hoping for.;neutral
I love sweet leaf drops, however this one tastes like cough syrup.  I'll go back to the original and flavor my drinks with real fruit.;neutral
Like the olives, but not many in the pack for the price;neutral
A little disappointed. I have used this in the past. Either this box isn't that strong or it doesn't have the right effect on me;neutral
"These don;t taste as fresh as some other brands.";neutral
Too sweet and the flowers are rubbery;neutral
This mix is way too sweet. I will add some cocoa powder next time I make it.;neutral
It was to strong for me my mom loves it;neutral
Fine - not good not bad. Right in the middle of most of the Keuring shaped coffee I have tried.;neutral
Prepared the contents exactly as instructed, I would say it doesn't smell or taste exactly like prepared pho. As an instant-style cup of soup it tastes okay.;neutral
I love the water but the on problem is it used to be around $19.00 and now it around $24.00.;neutral
I am not happy that it came with no seal what so ever.;neutral
These are okay!  It takes some getting used to the texture.  Maybe it was the RAW taste but not my fav!;neutral
The noodles are ok,The broth is lacking in flavor and not spicey at all. Could not detect any garlic or pepper flavor at all. I will not purchase this brand again.;neutral
The candy was fresh and well packaged but not all that sour. It was certainly more sour than regular airheads but not sour enough for those who want an extreme sour experience.;neutral
Took this backpacking, was light weight, but didn't taste right.  Carrots didn't reconstitute like other ingredients and there were too many onions.  Maybe if you add to a pot for just soup it would be ok.;neutral
I guess these are OK.  My issue is that all of the flavors taste about the same, and they all have a bit of a 'chemical taste'.  I won't re-order.  Nice packaging tho'.;neutral
Didn't tint my chap stick that well I'm disappointed;neutral
I wish they would make bags that just have the crunch and plain chocolate bars, those are the two with no artificial ingredients.;neutral
This was an organic brand I had not tried, so I went for it. It didn't have much of a flavor and didn't seem to revitalize like some do.;neutral
These are OK, but so sweet and not coffee tasting, so i would not purchase again and have many left.  bummer.;neutral
"I bought this because the sweetner is Stevia.
I have been using the Mio products and love them... wanted to step away from sucralose if possible.
i am disappointed in the flavor...
I will be going back to MIO";neutral
I've always been a fan of Grandma's cookies.  They just keep getting smaller and smaller. The taste of these weren't as good as I remember.;neutral
"a little expensive....

for what you receive, you can get a much better snack for the same value";neutral
Tastes ok kinda thicker than normal jello which I make now with crystal light packs and Knox gelatin that tastes the best;neutral
These are very tasty, however I wish I would have looked at the sugar content before I bought them.  If you're not watching sugar, I would recommend these.;neutral
"This isn't as good as I had hoped; I prefer to use Pamela's mix and add what I want.  I won't reorder";neutral
too many aloe chunks to be a refreshing drink;neutral
It served my purpose of crafting gifts but I was very disappointed at the smell. They did not smell like cinnamon, in fact, they were kinda stinky. Would not buy again.;neutral
These were OK but the price seems pretty high.  Check with the competition from Kirkland.  In my experience it's half the price and at least as good.;neutral
This had a strange separation,  didn't really care for it.;neutral
"a bit ""cardboard"" like I won't order them again but I didn't throw them in the trash.";neutral
they would have been delicious if they will be less salty;neutral
Meh. I have been trying to find a kona coffee on Amazon that tastes like what I had in Hawaii. Nothing comes close, including this one.;neutral
Tastes okay.  I had expected more flavor from the peanut butter but the chocolate taste dominated it.  I guess if you like chocolate then you will be happy with the taste.;neutral
I brew it with a peppermint tea bag and its lovely.  By itself, meh;neutral
IT IS MUCH FINER GROUND THAN I HAD EXPECTED.;neutral
Not spicy enough and too mayonaisey (if that is a word).;neutral
I thought it bland tasting, I've liked other brands better for thicker sauce, more clam meat, other brands filled me more. My hunger didn't feel satisfied with Heathy Choice Clam Chowder;neutral
I was hoping to find a product with a deep woodsy balsamic flavoring, this one is much too mild for my taste buds;neutral
Pretty good fig GF bars. They're satisfying and because they're fig add fiber when on the way to work! A bit dry;neutral
I did not benefit from what I could tell from this powder, not saying it's a bad product, just can't justify the price for me personally;neutral
While the popcorn is delicious, the price is too high.;neutral
I was hoping it was all that they say.... mmmm... bacon coffee... It's a great maple flavored coffee, gives the house a nice maple flavor... bacon? not s much..;neutral
An interesting addition/filler to your cooking & baking, but it is remarkably grainy and the texture never smooths out so that you have these roughage type crunchy bits in it;neutral
Good but pricey because the jar is half the size of the regular Pommery;neutral
"Hmmm... Not as good as the Starbucks Sumatra you can grind yourself for a standard coffee maker.
They need to fine tune it for the Keurig";neutral
Must be a matter of taste.  I didn't like it at all.;neutral
taste different from the tea bag one but ok;neutral
I found out the cacao oil has been extracted during the process for some reason. That is not what I am looking for. I need to purchase the original organic cacao powder not the processed ones.;neutral
It's OK, you can't go wrong with this brand if you look for a less acidic coffee. But the scent of hazelnuts is gone after a few second and not only fro a cup but from the whole bag...;neutral
Good quality stuff, I like the glass jar, it's since been re purposed. I don't think it was a good value for the small amount, however.;neutral
Taste is fine. However, if you follow directions exactly it tends to be a bit watery with less cheese than expected. We add a half cup of shredded cheddar to get consistency we want.;neutral
some flavors weren't as advertised. some bags were expired.;neutral
The product was okay but nothing different than ordinary, less expensive coffee.;neutral
It's ok, not my favorite or even 2-3rd. If it's all I have I'll drink it with more creamer than I normally use.;neutral
A little watery with flat taste.  Must be good for you;neutral
Makes nice quick creamy soup. Add seasoning.;neutral
These lays snack size bag chips were super salty.  They were fresh and delivery was crush free but I will look for the low sodium variety next time;neutral
Just a slight hint of vanilla and is a bit harsh for my taste--I needed to use cream to tone it down.;neutral
was wanting a little more cinnamon flavor to the mints can hardly taste anything but peppermint.;neutral
Meh.  Seriously.  Meh.  Nothing outstanding whatsoever when popped from a hot air popper, anyway.;neutral
I love the originals Kit Kat, the white chocolate is pretty good and the dark chocolate is ok.  Takes care of a chocolate craving so good enough!;neutral
Good coffee but if you really pay attention to the cost you are paying close to $100 a pound . I recommend buying the cm capsules and filling them with your own coffee.;neutral
Its OK, but unexpectedly it came in one big bag, a little inconvenient as we use this kind of snacks for road/photo trips;neutral
Taste great.  Not too spicy.  But expensive.  Also takes a long time to arrive.;neutral
Fair taste. May look elsewhere next time.;neutral
These aren't bad, but I strongly prefer other flavored sparkling water, like Perrier. There's just something a little weird about these flavors that doesn't hit the spot for me.;neutral
I have it in the refrigerator because the wood I was going to use is not the right kind of wood;neutral
Takes a long time to chew. Would recommend for dieters, but fresh is more pleasing to the palate. Handy work snack or when on the go.;neutral
These were okay, but not as tasty as I had hoped. Also, the packaging could have been better - at least 2 shells in each package were broken.  The price was really good for non-GMO corn, though;neutral
"Thought these were ""sweet"" onion flavored, not flavored with added sugar, but they are ok.";neutral
This is really good coffee but I stopped ordering it because the price just went up. Too pricy.  Would have given it,, 5stars if it hadn't been for that.;neutral
I like them a lot but the family does not, but they are to please. they don't like change.;neutral
not as expected but has a good flavor .... not sure i will buy again;neutral
this is for someone really love the sugar... it really sweet, I would like it if the chocolate is even darker to blend in the sweetness.;neutral
Bought these as my kids were hoping to crack walnuts in their nutcracker.  Sadly, these were all too big.;neutral
Not as yummy as we hoped. The kids won't eat it.;neutral
Meh but I think it's because the season is coming to a close.  Didn't ripen well for us but they were edible.;neutral
these are great tasting but i do agree with what other people have written, i wish there wasn't as much sugar as there is in them. I am a Clif Bar fan though.;neutral
I can't taste the fruit this time. Apparently the addition of champagne lessens the fruit flavors. Everything was good but that.;neutral
grainy. i was looking for creamier texture.;neutral
I like this brand a lot when purchased refrigerated in my local market.  These are different ingredients, have a funky smell and do absorb flavors like the fresh ones do. Buy local.;neutral
The peach is not there for my pallet. BUT the spiced part is excellent. Disappointed that it seems to have NO peach flavor at all....Still on the hunt for a great peach tea...;neutral
This was delicious as a tea but if I baked I think it would make good flavors too.;neutral
It's good overall, except I bought a wrong item;neutral
Not the greatest salted caramel flavor!;neutral
Too much whipped cream other wise good.;neutral
I too am used to fresh ground almond butter, and this product tastes different. I was unhappy that the ingredients also included palm oil;neutral
I like a more robust , richer flavor than the original Eight O'clock could offer.  The price was right so we thought we would try it.  You may like it if you like a weaker blend.;neutral
This is OK but not great. I was looking for a different brand but only found this. It tastes OK but doesn't have the smooth flavor I prefer.;neutral
There were at least 3 cups in the box that don't work in my Keurig,disappointed. There are several repeats of same coffee.;neutral
Everyone raves about this egg replacer but other brands do just as good of a job. Maybe they should update their pakage its a little old school.;neutral
Not too thrilled with this espresso, guess I'm spoiled with the Black Cat Projects' decaf espresso.;neutral
Box says Hawaiian Punch but tastes more like Grape Juice.  If you are looking for Hawaiian punch flavor try the Fruit Punch Flavor instead.;neutral
If there was something defining the complete absence of flavor, this might be it.;neutral
These cups are easy to prepare and very tasty. They are just too dang small for a serving and therefore pricey when you have to use 2 or 3 at a time.;neutral
did not seem very fresh just OK quality;neutral
It tastes fairly decent, but the PB brownie flavor is far better. If I'm craving a low cal chocolate chip cookie flavor, I'd go with Betty Crocker's Warm Delights or bake an actual cookie.;neutral
There are many EVOO's to pick from and this one is ok but nothing to go out of your way to get;neutral
Not as I thought, it was very strong and overpowering.;neutral
My daughter did not like them at all, I tried them. Just ok. Bland with a kind of chemical flavor.;neutral
it was okaay but  i think i used to much it was overpowering it sort of tasted good but something was a little off have to find out how to use it  but if you knowhowit would be great;neutral
The product was okay it requires a lot of support to become a substantial meal or offering.;neutral
They are ok. I find that the combination of ingridients varies from bar to bar, sometimes not a good as others.;neutral
I personally love it. Although, I have given it out to many friends and they all hate it. It does have those smoky flavors of bacon along with some added sweetness overall.;neutral
"We love the flavor and all the Walkers' cookies, but these were a bit *too* crunchy for us two chew-challenged oldsters.  But I find that most of these ""small"" cookies are like that no matter the brand.";neutral
flavors & freshness right on but better pricing if you join the nespresso online club;neutral
This tea was okay.  Definitely tasted the blackberry but no jasmine.  I absolutely love jasmine tea.;neutral
This flavor is just ok, love the black bean and the split pea also made by Dr. McDougall.;neutral
I purchased the coconut-date cookies and love them and gave them 5 stars.  These bars are not nearly as good as the coconut-date cookies.  These are just ok and not worth the price.;neutral
They are more dry than the larger chick o sticks. We love these and have been eating these since kids. Think next time will buy the larger ones again.;neutral
It's okay but I prefer the Hazelnut flavor;neutral
"They have an ""ok"" taste and are smaller than regular hamburger buns.  I probably won't buy these again b/c they weren't worth the expense.";neutral
"small amount it makes per portion. It tastes good. Expensive.
Worth a try. I liked it but not going to keep buying it. Costs too much. I don't eat a lot of peanut butter anyway.";neutral
"This was good, but it's not just ""coconut water"" as listed in the picture.  It lists: coconut water, natural ingredients...not sure what that is.  Probably will not buy after sampling.";neutral
I ordered rigate SPAGHETTI, but got this.  Not happy.;neutral
If you like soft and soggy seitan, this is for you. I was expecting a less soggy seitan. This is not it.;neutral
Very dry & tough jerky, and delivery took quite a while.;neutral
I burned the first few bags until I learned to turn my microwave to a lower setting. Don't follow the directions on the box.;neutral
Was not as tart and full of rind that I had hoped;neutral
Not as strong as advertised - meaning that this coffee doesn't have a body of a truly dark roast coffee blend.;neutral
Coffee is OK.  French Market Coffee with chicory is better;neutral
For low-cal snacks, these are ok, but they remind me of plane snacks. Very sugary and not very filling. I recommend getting the Oreo crisps instead. (They're by the same brand.);neutral
Very high quality, just not my favorite. I mix it with homemade and enjoy it that way.;neutral
I bought this for days when I was too busy to make lunch.  My kids found it rather bland.  Adding Himalayan salt makes it more palatable but we won't order it again.;neutral
For an ample amount of so called healthy ingredients, WHY pack it with so much SUGER?;neutral
It was rated one of the top but for me it was just ok.  I prefer a strong bold coffee.;neutral
Kind of dusty, a little bitter, better than Cruz De Malta in my opinion, but Guayaki is much better.;neutral
They are not like the ones we had years ago. They are very dry. Very expensive to ship.;neutral
I don't like the consistency. I will stick to my pink salt;neutral
Gift to a friend who did not like the taste of the tea.;neutral
Fine  just a lot flatter results compared to frosting;neutral
"coffee is mild but i can't justify paying this much for it.
all claims are true i would buy more if i had no other choices.";neutral
Okay, looking for a stronger cola taste;neutral
I liked experimenting with these new salts. I did find the red and black salts to be quite large though.;neutral
Powdery, impossible to pour.  The brand I had before - Zveet or Morning Pep - was in crystal form, very pourable.;neutral
Definitely needs more seasonings.  I actually had to add salt and pepper!  Lean Cuisine entree is much, much better.;neutral
Fried with bad oils for longer shelf life (for selling) and is thus cheaper than pure/simple nuts.;neutral
The flour looks to white and crepes came out with barely there color. There is no buckwheat taste to them.;neutral
It was OK ,over priced,and was not very fresh. and did not realy tast like Ginger,But I learned a lesson.;neutral
If you like Starbucks' industrial strength coffe this is for you. I like less burnt, and less acidic coffee.;neutral
This is good, but I would have preferred less poppy seeds and more salt, garlic and onions.  Good as a topping on homemade soft Bavarian pretzels.;neutral
I like it but lots of spice. Beware!;neutral
Too heavy and chewy for me. I will try to miss it with almond flour. It tasted good though.;neutral
It's OK but we will not be reordering this product. We tried several flavors and were not impressed with any.;neutral
Tasted like it was old. Not really a fresh taste. Some was a little dry.;neutral
Much as I despise aspartame, the flavor here just isn't the same. You're better off going with the classic.;neutral
bananas were shaped  like L's. not the most flavorful bananas i've had, but works for lunch.;neutral
It is just the noodles and does NOT come with any type of sauce.;neutral
The tins are small. but they're really cute and I do like them. The tea is pretty basic. Not bad, but not wonderful either.;neutral
Good for cold press.  Terrible for any other kind of coffee.  Better to start with good whole beans and grind your own.;neutral
I like it but we pay for a lot of moisture (H2o) in the salt;neutral
It was a gift for my sister's birthday. She didn't care much for it.;neutral
Flavor is good.. but once the item is refrigerated it turns into a solid BLOCK. I had bought it to use on salads and there is no way (without heating it) I can use it again.;neutral
...but I can't say I'm exactly thrilled with it. Gloria Jean's Brown Sugar Cake flavor K cup is far superior.;neutral
Nice flavor but a bit pricey for sweetener.;neutral
The Quaker Chocolate Chip granola bars are by far the best ones.  These are good but not the greatest.  Taste more like S'mores flavor.  Will not buy again.;neutral
love the raisins, always soft and fresh...;neutral
I don't know what to do with this. Not good for frying. I'd rather use plain butter or palm shortening.;neutral
"Very disappointed not any whole strawberries in it and I thought that was the purpose of Preserves
Did have a good taste.";neutral
I don't love this stuff as much as everybody else seems to. It's just not really to my taste. I'll stick with my Nissin Chili Flavor Top Ramen and leave this for the people who're nutty about it.;neutral
"I made the ""mistake"" of trying the Ruby Sipper first. After falling deeply, madly in love it the Ruby Sipper, my expectations were high. So this mild tea doesn't make the cut.";neutral
I think just based on the freshness and taste, I would give this product a 4. Next time I will by directly from the source. I also like their earl gray tea.;neutral
This was tasty coffee for a decaf.  The problem is, there was ABSOLUTELY no orange flavor!!!  I was very disappointed.;neutral
bear in mind that this has grains - quinoa, oat bran, brown rice;neutral
It is ok not what I thought it would be.;neutral
I enjoyed getting to try all these candies.  The let down was that they were all melted by the time I received it.;neutral
honey is very good. very hard to open (need scissors) and very hard to get the honey out. there is always some left. would not buy again or recommend.;neutral
not too thrilled with this, not sure I want to reorder palm oil;neutral
"Not the taste I remember from years in Turkey.  However, it is an ok pair of black teas; not great, not bad.";neutral
Cute and Delicious, but the plastic center piece broke off in my mouth. But the chocolate was so so tasty.;neutral
Inexpensive, but no depth of flavor so just sort of there.  I might as well be drinking Lipton.  The Bewley's is a much better tea at about double the cost if you want a decent Irish Breakfast tea.;neutral
My kid likes this kind of thing.  Eats almost any flavor but for these they liked only one flavor.  These are not so great.;neutral
It's actually too sweet, but works fine.;neutral
Marshmallow is the best flavor I've had, Vanilla tastes more like coconut.;neutral
Too much water, small clams this time..disappointed, but still better than the small cans;neutral
Edible, but not really very good.  Could be better if shipped overnight.;neutral
They are good..but in my opinion not to die for.;neutral
I haven't made it good yet,  I am still trying.;neutral
Don't like this as much as the Wild brand. It seems pretty tasteless. Vanilla seems hard to get these days though.;neutral
These are organic, but not tasty.  I suppose it could be due to the fact that they are canned and shipped, but wish they were tastier as I am a huge fan of pineapple.  Thanks for making organic!;neutral
A bit too expensive compared to equally competitive quality candy. Will not repeat purchase in the future;neutral
too much money for a cake mix..flavor was ok..;neutral
GREAT coffee, except, all of Peets is near the freshness expiration date.  I'll buy it again because I live too far away to get to the real stores.;neutral
I hope it isn't reflected in the flavor but this fluff is no where near as pink as this image shows.;neutral
I love Triscuit Crackers... they were mostly in pieces. Maybe crackers are not something to order online?;neutral
These are really good, but they are half the size I expected.  Because of this I will not purchase them again.;neutral
Good Coffee but I don't get it........ Taste like a good Coffee but is it worth the cost? I will stick to my Espresso Beans.;neutral
Baklava was a little dry. Needs more honey.;neutral
A bunch of them came broken in the pack and about half of them were hard/crunchy.;neutral
The raw nuts are stale when I receive them.  So toasting them is required to make them taste better.  They are a nice medium sized nut.;neutral
This turkey is a lifesaver if you are snowed in, and tastes pretty good but not enough turkey in the can. About half broth.;neutral
I run and work out. Sometimes I need a quick snack. This is very sweet for my taste. I cover with whipped cream cheese to mitigate the sweetness. I love Clif products, but this is not my favorite flavor.;neutral
I read that Colavita is not extra virgin as advertised.;neutral
not as rich and creamy as I had hoped;neutral
Well, it is too expensive - $5 for the tin, and less than $5 for the grass. Low in caffeine. Interesting taste...;neutral
I was seeking an less expensive alternative to Peets.  This isn't it, but it is slightly better than grocery shelf coffee.  Lacks aroma and body.  Not as strong as you would think for the name.;neutral
This you drink when you want to rocket your way through the day at lightning speed without tearing your tummy to shreds. Stay at home mom of three swears by it;neutral
Fair flavor not as good as others Ive tried.;neutral
"Well, I thought I was getting the ground ""beef,"" but I received the large chunks instead. Chewy and large once soaked and cooked.";neutral
"I tasted like fresh natural coconut water but it is very sweet; however my question is this:  Is sugar added? It is important for me to know this";neutral
Good idea but felt wears down too quickly.  Have to keep buying them every month.;neutral
Good price and fast shipping, but this stuff is very weak.  Great if you like weak coffee, but I don't.;neutral
Not good quality... turn green and bitterness compare to another I have which yellow and lightly sweeten taste...;neutral
good product but value better at walmart so only 3 stars;neutral
MMMM bacon.  It's good but the flavour is mild.  Not a bacony as other bacon jams I have had.;neutral
I did not like the flavor of this product. I didn't taste the citrus ginger, it tasted  quite different for me. Just my taste buds, others may love it.;neutral
Tastes just fine but too expensive for such tiny cans.;neutral
Seller was good but the coffee is too weak for me.;neutral
good for a morning breakfast treat with a poached egg.  has a funky watery texture when cooked.  decent if you can't eat wheat;neutral
Tastes ok but I guess my taste buds cannot handle dates very well.;neutral
Not recommended for single people in this quantity.  While cheaper than the supermarket, they go bad before one person can use them all.;neutral
The taste is better than stevia and more similar to actual sugar, but it is too expensive for now.;neutral
Some are good but some are also bad. You can not win them all!;neutral
The way this stuff is processed makes it clump in a way that makes it hard to measure out by a spoonful, but the quality is good otherwise.;neutral
It is a good tasting chili with plenty of meat. Some people may want it spicier so they can add some hot sauce. It makes a very filling and tasty meal.;neutral
First time buying these. They were okay. I would have preferred less cookie and more peanut butter. Overall not bad.;neutral
Tasty enough to satisfy random sweet cravings.;neutral
It's not so good as Kona blend for Keurig machines. I was impressed by deep tastes of keurig cups of this Kona blend. Beans tastes like regular coffee . I am upset, will not buy this brand again.;neutral
Was a little chewy I may try it again to see if its better.;neutral
So-so on taste, I guess it is not different than other instant coffees.  It is good to have on-hand for those times when perked coffee is too weak.;neutral
This is good to keep around work for when I can't get out for a real meal.  I don't believe I would purchase this again;neutral
It's good but it's not individually packed. I like to carry a few in my purse for when I eat out.;neutral
The basil flavor is stronger than I anticipated making this oil only good for certain things but definitely not one of your everyday use oil.;neutral
Not lemony  enough! Barely taste it. Just wasted calories;neutral
Good quality and favor but too salty for me.;neutral
Only gave it 3 as it is extremely sweet. If you like sweet, then I would recommend it to you;neutral
"Sorry for taking so long. Feed back is good as expected, thanks for a nice product! Happy with everything so far.
Don R. In Lakewood, CA";neutral
super salty - like drinking sea water;neutral
I am not a tea connoiseur, so my three stars could have been five or one.  One thing I can tell you, the price is good, and it was shipped on time.;neutral
I love these BUT every pack the wafers were broken.;neutral
Good flavor.  Crumble a lot.  Picking up pieces constantly.  Best on cereal, yogurt.;neutral
Cashews and honey roasted peanuts were fine, salted peanuts tasted stale.  I'd recommend buying peanuts in a jar or can.;neutral
These are the only reason that I am using my bread maker which failed to turn out a consistent loaf if made from scratch.;neutral
Nice flavor, but my tin was not full even though it as properly sealed.;neutral
This coconut oil has a strange porridge-like consistency that I've never seen in other coconut oils. It never completely solidifies, which is important since I was using this to make natural deodorant.;neutral
The vanilla flavor overpowered the cherry, otherwise ok. Too expensive for regular use though, especially with the meh taste for cherry vanilla.;neutral
A bit pricey, but I heard it recommended by other people online. I don't really get too much of the barrel aged flavor, but it's definitely on the saltier side compared to Asian bottled soy sauces.;neutral
hey, it's tang. bought it as an alternative to soda.;neutral
"It's okay; but like the cranberry and cinnamon sugar much better";neutral
Product I received was a bit old, they were too tough and very stiff and chewy.;neutral
very interesting sweetner, not my favorite so I mix it with others;neutral
Every 8 candy was cherry flavor instead of watermelon.;neutral
Harder and loses flavor faster than other gums by this manufacturer.  Having said that, they have actually replicated the taste of cotton candy.;neutral
I could live on these alone! YUMMY!!!;neutral
When I first started buying this it was much thicker.  The last 3 shipments have been watered down.  Maybe it's due to the season.  Don't know if I will buy again due to the fact that the can is not BPA-free.;neutral
Bought to lower blood pressure but it is too salty.  Go figure.;neutral
I thought this would have more of a tropical flavor. It sounded delicious, but was pretty bland.;neutral
I would have rated this higher but when it was delivered it was really mangled and flattened.;neutral
I was expecting it to be more like cocoa powder (cooking powder) it is not as chocolatty;neutral
Not my favorite decaf in a K cup, but tolerable. It isn't too strong, not too weak, just just OK.;neutral
Not as tasty as the 'real thing'...dry not buttery or very chocolatey.;neutral
"Crown Prince products are generally acceptable, but these anchovies are way too salty.

I would not buy again.

I much prefer Ortiz,  but they have been out of stock for months.";neutral
Fine as a lotion but doesn't taste well.;neutral
I've found nothing very special about this tea.;neutral
these were good if a bit gooey. wish it was a bigger box for the price though.;neutral
good product, not a very good package design.  No matter how you pour it, it drips everywhere.;neutral
Taste was good, but cups would not work in our Keurig. We had to empty cups into a bag, and stuff into self-serve cup. Aggrevating...;neutral
Taste is so so.  Large size.  I split it in two before eating it.  Won't buy again.;neutral
Good brand, but tasted too salty. Will update after order with no salt.;neutral
These are spicy!  The container is too small however;neutral
Turkey was very mushy...flavor reminded me of spam...too salty for me too...maybe I'll try another meat, cause I like the ingredients.;neutral
Very good wish the expiration date was farther out!;neutral
I do like this caramel syrup, however the more they increase the price, the less start I will give. American greed.;neutral
I got this for a filler for a gift basket and the person really likes them. The price is all right you need to use coupons and you get a good deal.;neutral
Too much sugar on it ,but it is ok my son love it;neutral
Quality item, but I can find organic quinoa for a better price elsewhere.;neutral
Just so-so by itself, so I mix it with Just Like Sugar Tabletop and it's better/sweeter.;neutral
i wanted to love this, but its kind of grainy and not as tasty as most.  On the other hand, there are NO additives in it, so it might be worth it, unless you want to make your own.;neutral
I had a similar product from another company that I loved, that audio had rice crisps in the dried fruit but these are really dry and taste kinda old.  I wasn't too thrilled about the texture.;neutral
To be honest I forgot how sweet Twizzlers are, I prefer Red Vines. Plus there is so much waste with Twizzlers, all those little wrappers....;neutral
These keep getting smaller and smaller.  I will not order them again.;neutral
Wasn't as bright green as shown and was more bitter than I am used to.;neutral
Shells appear thinner than most eggs I've had. Don't know if that's a good or bad thing but not something I'm used to.;neutral
but not as good as I expected based a friend's rave reviews. Came quickly and was well packaged--none broken. For a digestive, l thought they'd have more fiber.;neutral
tastes like powdered mix in water.  which is what it is, so...  We will not be ordering this again.  Mediocre quality at a high price.;neutral
Expected more from this product, they seem to have a quality control issue, inconstant, some are OK, and some are terribly weak..;neutral
Package arrived almost devastated.  Cans were dented.  Not true San Marco toms, but not validated from that region.  I worked with them, but they weren't the real thing.  Rather bitter.;neutral
Very good if you like natural peanutbutter;neutral
This project went nowhere.  A heck of a lot harder than they make it seem.;neutral
We just did not care for it as well as some of the other Davidson teas.  It is organic.;neutral
Decent, does not replace the quality of Nesspresso, although I may simply be patterned having enjoyed it for so many years. I always compare strongest vs Ristretto.;neutral
Bought this for a family member, who says it 'doesn't taste like real cola, but it's still good'.;neutral
Take about 3 to 4 to give flavor to coffee per my guests;neutral
nothing special in terms of taste, but they are not that bad either. i needed some chocolate and almonds for a hike and this combined the two. everyone loved the idea.;neutral
Perrier is a good drink but in this case there were many bottles that had no effervescense left at all. Very disappointing.;neutral
Just OK , you can really smell the garlic however it just tastes like plain popcorn;neutral
They have a good taste, but too darn sweet for me.;neutral
crunchy ike coffee beans. A bit bitter. Chocolate after-taste.  I wasn't sure what to expect. I will try them in cereal next.;neutral
Bold flavors, incredibly rich and dark. Can be a bit off-putting a first, I prefer the Smooth Bold from Maxwell house, found this to be too bitter for my liking;neutral
The caramel and French Vanilla were very good. We didn't like the Pumpkin Spice. The others were just OK.;neutral
I love lemon heads but after a while they really tear your mouth up,...oh well.;neutral
This stuff is ok but I never got used to it and it cost too much as I recall.;neutral
I used for detox but will not thrilled with the taste.;neutral
Tastes like beets, color not as red though, rather rust colored. Gives me a little push, I imagine ;neutral
I like the flavor of this tea, but it's not organic, so I probably won't buy it again.;neutral
Okay but not as good as Trader Joe's.;neutral
Over all I love Yogi tea but in this instance I perfer Her Tea by Your Tea over Moon Cycle.;neutral
Great tasting pumpkin spice but if you look at my other reviews, it is verrrrry sweet.  Too much for my blood sugar. I cannot drink this every day.;neutral
I used to get these in my monthly delivery but last time there were very few pistachios and many more peanuts.  So, I just buy the nuts separatly now.;neutral
Great when you first open. Unfortunately, they go stale awfully fast.;neutral
"After reading the reviews, I was excited to order this; however, they upset my stomach.  It's the guar gum and other additives.  Too bad, as they taste pretty good (although not great).";neutral
This pineapple barely has any flavor. Also, a lot of the pieces still have a bit of core.;neutral
Bought these by mistake (wanted Hunt's), they are edible with a good dollop of Reddi-wip!;neutral
Tasty but very expensive they have the same brand cheaper at Kroger in my town;neutral
"It's not certified organic, and the ""normal"" price is not good at all.  But it tastes good";neutral
This is ok. Doesnt have as strong a coconut taste as I was expecting.;neutral
Arrived with a huge dent in it.  Was shipped with other heavier products.  The milk itself though is great. Love the smooth flavor.  Great for recipes.;neutral
These are ok, but not as flavorful a I had hoped and I find them a little bitter.;neutral
Just ok, nothing to get excited about.;neutral
not as tasty as I expected, orange flavor is not very strong;neutral
The package was very small. I didn't realize it was under 1 pound until I received it. I probably won't buy these again.;neutral
Extremely mushy.  So I made creamed spinach out of it by adding a can of creamed soup.;neutral
Disappointed. Tastes highly artificial, no real fruit flavor to it.;neutral
First time I ordered these there were no problems. In this last order three came cracked.  7 exploded when boiling.  7 usable eggs. I will try a different brand.;neutral
It's a great idea with a good nutritional profile and a nice texture. But it tastes like beans.;neutral
"Good but its just good. Nothing special. I normally like iced coffee but I feel those hot instant coffee beat this both from taste and the price.
I might try it as my breakfast someday to see how it works.";neutral
It was nice to find an unsalted nut mix that did not have pistachios in it.;neutral
Not as good as the breakfast sandwhiches;neutral
Love the options, but where sort of stale;neutral
This is good coffee but I was expecting more of a minty flavor.  Mild flavor only.;neutral
To be fair I've never tried pumpkin spice before so I don't know how it compares to other pumpkin spice blends. that's why they got a three instead of one star.;neutral
I now know I prefer finer grains of couscous over the larger pearls offered in this product.;neutral
I love Christmas blend coffees, but this was a not what I expected.  I have to say it is bitter.  I drank only one cup and will save it for emergencies when I run out of other k cups.;neutral
I like the fact that this is an organic tea, but the vanilla flavor is very light. Tried using two tea bags, but that just made the rooibos flavor stronger and really did nothing to the vanilla flavor.;neutral
This bag was busted with other heavy item thrown on top during prime pantry order.,;neutral
i guess the flavor was below my expectations, its rather a bit too sweet, plus each box shouldn't cost more than 50 cents IMHO, i am going to stick with apple cinnamon, that flavor has always been good;neutral
Sometimes too thick, other times okay in texture. Too much of a hit or miss. Flavor is definitely there, texture isn't. If you don't like to battle your peanut butter to get on bread, stay away.;neutral
Its meh.  Not horrible but wouldnt buy it again likely.;neutral
This tasted too sweet to me, not to my son and husband.;neutral
Good flavor, but the mints seemed to be old.;neutral
The taste is not great on this and it does not dissolve as I have experienced with other brands.;neutral
Wish this didn't come in a plastic bottle;neutral
last resort corn xylitol if I can't find birch one for a good price;neutral
"I simply do not understand the excitement about this chili.

About the same as Dennison's or Hormel, nothing to write home about and now near where as good as fresh with Caroll Shelby's mix.";neutral
The taste was ok, but I didn't love it.  It tasted kind of off.;neutral
Found it to be quite bitter and very strong, while not my personal taste, Im sure there are those who enjoy it that way.;neutral
"Not a bad cup of tea, but the ""loose leaf"" has the consistency of coffee grounds. The ""leaves"" pass through my strainer and float in my cup. If this bothers you, try something else.";neutral
Even though it is called baby white, I didn't think it would be that small. My preference is something larger, something to hold onto. Good flavor and tender, however.;neutral
I usually make a pie with this one.  But if you have ever had a real pie made with Key Limes, you'll be disappointed.  Still, it makes a decent, low sugar, lower calorie dessert.;neutral
"A good strong coffee but compared to its equal Mellitta European it is significantly no gain for a large price.  Tastes differ, so this is just an opinion; but I strongly suggest you make the same comparison.";neutral
The company consistently produces great quality cooking oils.  This is just not a personal favorite.;neutral
Good but not great would buy it again though;neutral
This coffee is just ok. Not a robust coffee taste. Flavor is blah. Won't purchase again.of course this is based on my taste.;neutral
This is only for the meat. You must add the fixings / veggies.;neutral
They taste great but you will still be very hungry if you're using this as a snack to get you by!  Very small!;neutral
A little too sweet for me since I rarely eat sweets.  But thought paring it w/ peanut butter would work for me.  It didn't however I love it in my protein shakes in the morning.;neutral
I was a bit disappointed in the flavor.  I love their gum and thought the mints would be the same flavor.  I was wrong.  They are full of the fake sugar flavor and less of the peppermint.;neutral
Kind of underwhelming since it includes a lot of snacks you can just find in your local asian supermarket. I was hoping it'd have some of the crazier candies that you can't find in the US.;neutral
Only got 4, the picture shows 6. Someone should probably update that. I've bought it a few times so I've thought and it seems to always be a different experience.;neutral
Not what I had hoped for, the brand I normally use is currently not available. I took a chance on this brand. It's ok.;neutral
It's O.K. most likely will not reorder.....;neutral
Taste good, they are very large, so if you want a amount it won't work some.;neutral
Not any better than what is in my grocery store, so not worth the cost.;neutral
Meh, kind of bland, but they aren't bad.;neutral
I will not order this product again since the apricots were most often small, hard and difficult to chew.  The quality of the apricots are Dminus.;neutral
"Taste like.... Carbonated green tea with lemon. Not horrible but not really good.
I've noticed no change to my mood focus or stress levels. My wife needs to drink a can.";neutral
I was so expecting for this tea , but it jus tasteless then what I tought !  Price doesn't match to quality ! 3star;neutral
I like the product but will not purchase again due to pricing.  Way overpriced! I knew the price when making the purchase but each box only makes 2 cups;neutral
It's a great price and it was ok.  But not our favorite as far as flavor and the cheese sauce texture.  We prefer the Back to Nature brand of the onese we've tried.;neutral
A lot saltier than I expected. Pleased that there is no MSG.;neutral
UR basic goji berry.  I don't believe they're a superfood & they are very expensive. Just going back to affordable fruit.  Good if u want to waste ur money;neutral
A bit dry and hard to spread.  For me, I like peanut butter more, and the price is much lower;neutral
I was so happy to find a meat stick/bar without sugar but unfortunately this one just did not sit well with me.  I think it is a little too greasy.  It is tasty but my stomach says no.;neutral
Take longer to cook than the previous ones I bought.  They also have a stronger flavor and a firmer texture that I don't prefer.;neutral
The yield on this is not as high as Orville Redenbacher.  The flavor is good but nothing extraordinary.  I will stick to buying the Troyer brand from my local Amish stores, which tastes much better.;neutral
arribed somwhat smashed into tidbits;neutral
They were a little more expensive than the store, but mostly just wasn't a huge fan. The flavor seemed artificial and overpowering;neutral
Good product but not too many pieces of chicken inside. I would have given it a greater rating if it it had more chicken inside. The quantity is really minimal.;neutral
Not what I expected, tasted like sour grapefruit juice. Will need to add lots of sweetner. My mistake, the product is probably good.;neutral
My fault but lots of sugar. For some reason I thought these would be a bit more healthy;neutral
Seemed somewhat stale. Would not buy them again.;neutral
This is the 2nd box I have ordered.  The 1st box was fantastic,  This 2nd box came with the truffles melted and pretty much not edible.  I was sorry as these are so good.;neutral
Works for me.. But I prefer the meat sauce entree over this. This is a little sweet.when the cost goes down for the meat sauce version I'll re-order.;neutral
Individual packs are too small and the flavor is so-so. Not a product I would buy again.;neutral
It is a bit sweeter than I remember;neutral
I'm used to making my own.  this is organic, but has Xanthan gum, tapioca , organic.  Bone broth usually has organic saturated fat in it, which has health benefits.  There's almost no fat in this.;neutral
Love Bob's cereal,but this one not so much. Too many sticks for my taste. The least favorite of any of the Bob's Red Mill products I have tried.;neutral
Very little tangerine flavor and almost exclusively tasted only of sugar.  Arrived mostly unbroken.;neutral
A bit too grainy for my taste, but overall very good and hits the spot on the way to work every time.;neutral
stale product. again. buying at the store next time;neutral
There were quite a few same selections. It's okay for a starter pack, but you will need something else if you want a wide variety.;neutral
Packaging looked a bit sketchy and doesn't quiet taste like the one I bought directly from Red Robin but still good.;neutral
Flavor didn't last long for any of them!;neutral
For some reason some things just taste better in glass bottles. This is one of them. No aluminum taste, and they're still good, just not quite up to what I'm used to from my Chipotle splurges.;neutral
Jar too small for strawberry jam and a bit too sweet.;neutral
Okay, not great. Had hoped for a richer flavor. Has a bitter kick to it.;neutral
ok except i don't like the buttery oil taste---not my favorite taste --- I'll be tiring another brand  next time.;neutral
Texture is good, but not much flavor.;neutral
I just don't understand why it cost so much more than the gmo popcorn.  I probably won't be buying this popcorn again.  Too much to pay for just okay.;neutral
I don't like the beef and Elk sticks as much as the beef/ostrich.;neutral
Not bad, there are better vegan jerky options. The texture was good, but the taste was a little off. Not horrible, but again, I didn't love the way it tasted.;neutral
These were okay, but I have had better ones.;neutral
The taste is excellent but the grounds are so find that my espresso machine took forever to brew. Once we used it all up, I bought Lavazza whole beans and grind the beans myself. Works much better.;neutral
The No Fun Jo Decaf coffee was OK.  We liked the organic aspect of it, but the price was too  high for us to buy it all the time as we do drink a lot of coffee.;neutral
These really taste good, but for the price there should be some anise in there.  It was not one of the ingredients.;neutral
It's ok. You need A LOT to make anything shimmer and depending on the color fondant you use, it sometimes just makes the fondant look dirty.;neutral
Nothing big here.  It is portable and thats all but very expensive.  Not really worth the price.;neutral
Was a ok product the taste was a little on the salty side.;neutral
not the best i am disappointed very dry not  tasty sorry but i won't be buying from them again. first time i have eaten fruitcake i don't like i love fruitcake every Christmas very disappointed;neutral
This can be used for soup or gravy.  I need to control my sodium (salt)Intake so this helps alot. You still have to use a little salt or it's tastless, but this is the best alternative.;neutral
little greasier but its still just okay. Id say add more sugar or change syrup.;neutral
I like the soup but it's very salty especially if your watching your sodium intake.  This particular soup has 480gm of sodium per cup and this can contains 2 cups.  That equals alot of sodium.;neutral
This is a gift so I will update when the receiver lets me know how they are--;neutral
Didn't work as well as I thought it would for thickening gravy.;neutral
Flavor was decent, but the texture was off.  Won't buy again.;neutral
OK, salty, but not as much of an alder smokey essence to my liking.;neutral
Still get some of the awful aftertaste.  And the price is simply ridiculous.;neutral
The first batch i received tasted stale.;neutral
expensive and arrived all broken in pieces. Wish I could find them at a local store.;neutral
I thought product would have more of a watermelon taste.;neutral
My husband loved these but we stopped buying them because of the MSG;neutral
Some of them tasted almost chemically.  Won't buy these again. They seemed dirty too.;neutral
"I read such great reviews about these, I had higher expectations. Turns out, they are just ""OK"" Wouldn't order again.";neutral
I didn't expect that this product is from China. If you think these products from USA, Do not buy this from the Amazon.com. They are from China which I can not guarantee the quality for specially foods.;neutral
Tasted old. But usually good, especially the Carmel one. The espresso one tasted burnt!;neutral
This coffee is a little weaker than what I am used to and the flavors were not very strong either.  I hate when they include decaf coffee with the sample packs because I don't ever drink decaf.;neutral
this is the only gum I've found in the U.S. that contains Recaldent. I'd give it 5 stars if it didn't contain aspartame.;neutral
Doesn't taste like the bottles. Not bad but not as good.;neutral
I love Harney & Sons tea but I did not love this one. The tin is cute but that's about it. My favorites are Paris, Earl Grey, English Breakfast and I absolutely adore Spicy Cinnamon.;neutral
Not as strong of a taste as I thought it would be. Even after steeping, I now use with another tea for a stronger taste;neutral
"This seemed ""thin"".  It did not have the full-bodied flavor of other brands (specifically Zico and VitaCoco).  We would not select again.";neutral
Good not worth the price will not order again;neutral
"I bought these as ""filler"" to get free shipping.  If it looks like Apple Jacks & smells like Apple Jacks it must be Apple Jacks!!";neutral
I use this on body butter recipe. But it is gritty.  Makes the body butter gritty at times.;neutral
Okay, pretty good.  Not great.  Slightly stale.;neutral
Not  as impressed with this flavor--it's OK--;neutral
Great cinnamon but it's too expensive for the tiny little box that you get ...kind of a cute little box very mini... it's about an inch wide and deep come on guys please use a bigger box !;neutral
Product tastes alright, beware of what you pay for though. I paid around $22 and only received 1 - 3.25oz bag;neutral
Great healthy ingredients but it is hard. That's the trade-off. You have to heat it to soften it up a bit. It does not break. Flavor -so/so;neutral
Not enough smoke flavor to really make a difference.;neutral
This tea has a strange taste, but it is soothing.;neutral
I don't know if authentic maeda-en suppose to taste like but for my personal taste - it's really light. I have to use like 2 bag at one to get some stronger flavor;neutral
These used to be our favorites - all 3 flavors - but they got WAY more expensive in the last few months and are no longer on Subscribe and Save, making them even more expensive.;neutral
Tear easily if you use it for a sandwich...;neutral
Variety of flavors delivered, many were duplicates of others. Coffee flavors do not taste as described, but still pretty good coffee.;neutral
They are very tasty and good ingredient.  The issue here is the price, for the price it's not worth it,  If they were $2-3 more than other brands then it would be worth it.  As the price stands they do not.;neutral
"Austin-Cookies & Crackers Variety Pack, 45...
 Austin";neutral
Quality is excellent -- but do they use pesticides and herbicides?  I think the answer is YES........;neutral
They are okay. Big cups are weak, like most Coffee People products. I won't purchase again though.;neutral
Just okay, not as good as other Godiva products I have purchases;neutral
The taste is ok, but, be aware that they are VERY spicy!  Too hot for my husband. An ok substitute if you're going vegan and really miss cheese.;neutral
Its tastes good but I didn't feel sleepy from it. I was sorta looking for that sleepy effect but I'm not going to b*tch and moan because it did tastes good ! :);neutral
My mom loves this coffee! Her favorite! The price has gone up so much,she can't get it anymore... For that I'm disappointed;neutral
love how much you get for the $. But some cups come out bitter. Just an fyi;neutral
I used to love this product. I don't know why they are much much tougher to chew now. The flavor is still same however;neutral
"Price wise? I keep my extra virgen olive oil 2 liter ""first cold pressed"" $10.00 versus 16 oz  macademia nut oil for $13.00";neutral
The rating fits because Pepperoni is not for everyone.  But it is enjoyed by all the family including the dog.;neutral
"Although ""lemon-lime"", these are definitely, more lemon than lime.  My hope was that the lime flavor would be more prominent.  Now I know, that's not the case.";neutral
Not the best and not the worst.  Middle of the road kind of stuff you know?;neutral
It didn't taste all that great to be honest. Bought it because their regular roast organic coffee is fantastic...this, not so much.;neutral
Much more kick / heat than the reviewers here stated.  They said it's mild but to me it was at least 10 x hotter than the Thai Kitchen version.  I had to cut it with tomato to use it.;neutral
kind of a mineral taste to them in the beginning.  they are okay i guess but i prob wouldn't get them again.;neutral
I didn't realize how many bags I was buying at once. They were decent. I ended up eating about six bags and I get really depressed when I think about it;neutral
the brown was dry  and all others color are to much wet, but are  the only ones, the colors are strong and pretty;neutral
most wre light blends, has a watery taste.;neutral
I tried to like this- i really wanted to.  i just could not get it to taste good in anything.  and i love the taste of beets.... will not purchase again.  guess i just need to cook and eat beets!;neutral
These chips are good.  They taste just like buttered popcorn, but they are high in sodium, are not organic, & I would assume genetically modified corn was used.;neutral
There are a lot of peas.  The taste is OK.;neutral
This matcha tastes ok, but would be better used in recipes than as a tea. I prefer a less bitter taste for my morning tea.;neutral
This was tasty, but the packaging is not simple to open (needed scissors).  I liked it, but I will not buy again.;neutral
okay, will not purchase again, it is light, and I do like coffee in the evening on the mild/light side. The taste is not what I want.;neutral
Bland in flavor and very sticky in texture.  I don't know if these were a little old or what, but probably wouldn't buy again.;neutral
These dates are okay but in the past they have come from Israel and they were delicious. The package this time said from California and definitely not of the same quality.;neutral
Because two of the holders are too large, all of my K-cups do not stay in place. The product I received is flawed.;neutral
Good, but some were bitter, like they were bad.;neutral
Product is good but packaging is very poor. Would not buy again unless packaging is upgraded to seal product in better.;neutral
I love how this cheese smells in the jar. I got this to sprinkle on my air popped popcorn. Should come with a booklet on how to use this powdered cheese.;neutral
"It didn't taste fresh; but I liked the idea [again this was awhile ago-and I didn't do a review]. Hopefully, other java fans will get a nice, fresh selection.";neutral
This one is okay, I am a bigger fan of the chocolate sea salt. The caramel sea salt is more sweet than salty.;neutral
I didn't like the smell or taste, but some people may find it OK for cooking.;neutral
Not very exciting, not very flavorful.;neutral
"Bland tasting, if following directions to use a whole can of water to re constitute  then it's weak. Use a half can instead.
I won't be buying this again.";neutral
Not bad, but not something I'd buy again. I'm just not a fan of chocolate pecan pie.;neutral
I generally like walkers' shortbreads. But these assorted shortbreads taste just ok. They do have three different shapes of shortbreads, but they all taste the same. I wish they have more flavors.;neutral
a few too many dark flavors for my taste - but a few were very tasty;neutral
Good quality but didn't work for my bladder issues;neutral
This is a matter of taste.  I ordered a case and shared with friends.  The reviews were not wonderful.;neutral
I did not like this. It is too thick and doesn't mimic Fettuccine at all.  I will not buy it again.;neutral
Even med. roast I thought this coffee was still pretty strong.  My family loved.;neutral
Loved Joyva since childhood and buy it whenever i see it in stores. This, however, arrived super heated in delivery box and even after chilling didn't have the flavor i remembered. Good but not great.;neutral
Has the consistency of refried black beans, not soup. Still tasty if you eat it with corn chips or something similar. I'd recommend the McDougall split pea varieties instead.;neutral
Nice to have on hand, but the taste just seem okay.  Not sure if I will order again.  The packaging is nice.;neutral
Not as effective as it might be.  If it weren't for the added salt, it would add no flavor to the dish at all.;neutral
The first one was not very good but then I placed them in the fridge and then tried one.. They were quite yummy and tasted of sugar..;neutral
Well, this tastes OK... and I'm sort of regretting buying as many as I did. Also didn't realize that this was sweetened with splenda... a little too sweet in my opinion. Oh well. :(;neutral
Really good flavor with ice but a bit too sweet for me.;neutral
Love Field Roast but not a big fan of this flavor. Not sure why but for some reason Field Roast always upsets my stomach. Can't stay away for the sage flavor though, so delicious!;neutral
Yet another item you buy when your up at 3 am & can't sleep.;neutral
Love Pur gum but don't care for this flavor. The mint it better in my opinion.;neutral
Disappointed.  This coffee did not have the distinctive Columbian coffee flavor.  The beans were immature and over roasted.  The result was a burnt flavor after grinding.;neutral
this is a nice, mild tea with an interesting flavor.  It compares well with other assam teas I've had.  I like more robust teas better.;neutral
"Don't really get the ""chinese"" part of this flavor but quality is good.";neutral
From previous purchases I love these, but shipping on HOT days makes the nuts stick together and sticky.;neutral
I tried it once. i have yet to try it again.;neutral
"These are a novelty gift.
Chocolate wrapped in black paper to imitate coal.
 The chocolate is mixed with cereal
The chocolate treat taste is uninspired so its use is primarily as a novelty or joke gift.";neutral
it could have a bit more flavor to it.;neutral
but the cans they come in are AWEFUL. Sloppy mess. Won't return;neutral
They don't taste fruity like the ones I remember and they have a bit of an aftertaste.;neutral
I am not sure what I was expecting. But, they are not like the French truffles I have had, or high quality Dutch chocolate. They were. Closer to normal American chocolates to me.;neutral
Great variety although we were not familiar with some of the brands. The teas brewed just fine and all is well.;neutral
Not my choice. Don't really know how to use it. Makes sub-par tasting cornbread and don't want corn cake.;neutral
It's ok.  Tastes like instant to me.;neutral
love the louisville jerkies, but this flavor is way too salty!;neutral
The taste is very very subtle.....or weak in other works.  I like my flavored coffee to be bolder.  I will stick with Gloria Jeans Mudslide..;neutral
Taste great.  Disappointed that a fair number of them were crunched in the packages.  Guessing it happened prior to shipment.;neutral
I'm not a huge fan of apple juice, but this has a pretty good flavor, I wasn't too thrilled about there being some sediment, so I probably won't be buying again.;neutral
It's good popcorn, but not the big kernels they claim it will be.  I think  it is overpriced for what you get.;neutral
it is very hot, but so are lit matches -- needs more flavor;neutral
"just ok. Maybe they would be better dipped in chocolate ha! They are dry and taste like cardboard. The ""unique"" brand of sprouted wheat pretzels are better , as far as ""healthy"" pretzels go....";neutral
Good product but we are now able to buy Bragg's locally for a good price and this was not superior so we won't be ordering again.;neutral
I DID NOT CARE MUCH FOR THE ANIMAL CRACKERS OR THE CHEESE-IT. THE CHEESE-IT WERE NOT SALTY ENOUGH AND THE ANIMAL CRACKERS WERE DULL.;neutral
not much a fan of this type of pasta...the texture is not what I was expecting;neutral
Raviolis good, sauce awful. Why don't they ever improve the Sauce? It's been the same 50 years.;neutral
It's ok for a jarred sauce. Too sweet for my tastes though.;neutral
This product was okay, but the taste gave me the impression they were not too ripe when they were processed.  Figs in cans are difficult to find at best so I gave them atry.;neutral
They are ok but I use different ones.  They didn't seem to seal up as well as others I have used.  Did not reorder these.;neutral
The artichokes had a nasty taste here and there. Perhaps I did not wash them well enough. Maybe I should have soaked them for awhile first, and then changed the water before cookking them?;neutral
Some flavours are super and some are lacking.;neutral
I'm not a big Chipotle fan, but needed this for a recipe. It's pretty good. The only disappointment was when I rec'd it the jar was open and the spice was throughout the box.;neutral
Kinda gross for eating...just sayin';neutral
I wanted to like these as a low calorie creamer. I did not like the taste at all.;neutral
My husband loves the flavor but doesnt like how small the seeds are.;neutral
It was ok but, it just didn't taste like fresh ground beef.;neutral
Can is heavier metal and a bit harder to open that I would like, Sardines are fine, but I prefer kippers - not the products fault, just my preference.;neutral
I bought them to have something different on hand. They tasted fine, but the texture does seem a bit off. Strong orange flavor.;neutral
ORDERED THE WRONG VARIETY. THE MULTIGRAIN VERSION MY WIFE IS ALERGIC TO ONION AND GARLIC.;neutral
These are not too good. Meat is dry. Potatoes are not too bad. Wait till you're starving and then you'll be able to choke it down.;neutral
"too salty, I had many different kinds of protein snacks before, and I am not sure if I want to buy this again due to ""unusual"" amount of salty feel (not just sodium amount but taste)";neutral
Not my favorite flavor. Has a funny taste to me that I just did not like. It's OK, but I won't buy again.;neutral
Seems to be much more lumpy than other matcha powders I have used, and has a sharper taste.  In all, I prefer the other brands I've used over this one, for those two reasons.;neutral
Very heavy on liquid smoke and Chipotle, to the point where the sauce has a bitter heat to it. Just not a satisfying flavor, but it is decently hot;neutral
it was kind of chalky and hard to get the excess powder out after it steeped but it has a great flavor to it;neutral
This item has additives that I'm unsure about and I notice it has more chicken fat in the can than Snow's which is my preferred brand.;neutral
Great but took forever to ship them.;neutral
"Taste is personal and I found this particular brand of Apple Butter rather bland and would probably not buy it again.  However, others might like it a lot; suggest trying it to see if you like it.";neutral
We ate all of them so they couldn't be too bad but won't order again.;neutral
It was OK. Meh. I think that this serves as a great stop gap ia you do not have time to make your own from scratch but I have had better.;neutral
Red-strong cinnamon, green-spearmint, white-peppermint,orange-orange,pink-wintergreen,yellow-banana.  Not quite what I was looking for to replace what I get out of the machine.;neutral
"disappointing

must admit am not a blueberry fan, but was trying
and even with two bags is weak and wussy
 yes - white tea is hugely healthy, but this is not IT for me";neutral
Pretty good but not worth the money. Flavor degrades quickly as the cup of coffee cools.;neutral
I love that this product is free trade and organic, but it honestly just doesn't taste great. I will head to my local TJ's for my organic coffee from now on.;neutral
These don't have much flavor, tasting more like an ordinary tortilla chip.;neutral
Not as good as the other Mchites biscuits, but makes a great snack.;neutral
I expected a bit more punch in this sauce.  Will use them but have to 'doctor' it up.  It is a quick preparation.;neutral
It tastes Ok. But it is somehow a little too salty for my taste. Can't complain too much though;neutral
I'd like to help Fair Trade and Organic, but turned out I lost a full flavor of real Colombian's coffee. My solution is 1 pod Wolfgang Puck and another pod of Mellita or Baronet.;neutral
The taste is okay. Not thrilled by the taste, but I didn't hate it, it's okay.;neutral
tried several brand, choose this one for it's price.  The taste is not the best grade.;neutral
It's very hot, but doesn't taste too good;neutral
It's decent coffee.  Will stick to my Seattles best;neutral
I've had better dry roasted edamame but still like them. Won't be ordering again though.;neutral
"OK noodle, not as expected

Sorry my WEILEI has not been opened yet";neutral
Not as flavorful as I had expected.  Will stick to plain, old, balsamic vinegar in the future. First had a glaze at a restaurant in NYC a month ago.  This doesnt come close.;neutral
This bread mix wasn't bad but we thought it lacked flavor and was a little too dry. Nothing special.;neutral
Alot more calories than just using real oranges;neutral
Half of the very large container was crushed pieces. Very good taste mix, we ate it anyway. Minus two stars for crumbs;neutral
Definitely better heated. I like these okay, but other flavors suit me better.;neutral
Unlike Bali's black tea candy, the tea flavor here is not as profound. It's a decent candy, made of all natural ingredients, but if you're a fan of green tea, you might be a bit disappointed with these.;neutral
Tends to run a little chew and dry.;neutral
They all taste the same....very little difference, except the Cinnamon and coconut... If you expect strong sage, rosemary, ginger flavor, you'll be disappointed...;neutral
I unfortunately wasn't able to use this in time. The date on the package said it was good until sometime next year but mine was molding already. It wasn't the ok white mold either it was green mold.;neutral
Never tasted this. Bought it based on reviews. Didnt expect it to be so bland. Needs salt and onion powder to start tasting good.;neutral
I was a bit disappointed with these. The sauce wasn't as good as I remembered it being.;neutral
Label it better so that it is easier to tell that the majority of these cups won't work on Keurig 2.0;neutral
Like other sugar free items, GI distress follows with anything more than a tiny amount. Not that tasty, but compromises are required when avoiding sugar.;neutral
Tastes great.  But, I will say it is NOT as strong as Bigelow brand.  I have to use three of these compared to one of the Bigelow;neutral
Not as much flavor as I'd hoped, but distinctly Ethiopian.;neutral
Its ok, very heavy on the celery flavor, and still has pretty high salt content. It is very overpriced though, skip this and go to your local store and look for the same type of product for half the price.;neutral
These are not really Blue Diamond Brand I don't think. I tasted them side by side with supermarket purchase  in official packaging and these are much less smokey. Still good though. But won't buy them again;neutral
Tasty but expiration date was 2 weeks from when I got 12 bags of them. Disappointing. I shared with friends so they wouldn't go to waste.;neutral
I was disappointed with this mixture.  The almonds are very small, a few other nuts but mostly peanuts.  There are not best quality nuts.;neutral
It really was not much variety, mostly snickers;neutral
Not the best, but better than no brownies at all!!!;neutral
Did not care for the taste of this .;neutral
It was spilled when I got it. The plant was so bruised and broken. I did try to plant it and baby it along. But it died. I will get another one. I have found the full size plants seem to arrive better shape.;neutral
Personally I didn't find these to be very good- I was expecting more of a freeze-dried berry but these were more like hard seeds;neutral
Taste is good......cost is considerably more than at Krogers, HEB, etc.;neutral
It is very nice to have a very hypoallergenic dairy free option----but the added magnesium in the product makes me have BMs that are powerful and hurt---I did not need any extra magnesium;neutral
They have changed the recipe. It is okay, but not as good as it once was.;neutral
I tried this and decided I don't really like almond butter.  It seems very grainy.  Not like peanut butter at all;neutral
We roast our own coffee and I thought I'd try this brand.  Not too bad but I've had better.  The price compares to other brands.  I'll not purchase this again because I like sampling different beans.;neutral
It has a flavor that I just don't love. Prefer liquid sucralose from JD Group or EZ Sweetz;neutral
The flavor doesn't compare using the Kuerig 2.0.  I really haven't found a coffee that tastes good using the Kuerig 2.0.;neutral
It tastes like a regular dense run of the mill black tea to me. I wanted it to be fabulous but it just didn't send me like I wanted it to.;neutral
"The flavor was ""ok"".  Unfortunately, I had to throw some of the creamers away.  The expiration date was too close to the delivery date.";neutral
my previous orders have been fantastic.  avocado have been the main reason I kept my fresh subscriptions but lately the avocados are rotten and inedible.;neutral
I got it as a sample. I won't be buying it but I do love most of the Kind bars.;neutral
Flavor was good, but the texture nothing like good quality bacon jerky other brands have. Not on my re-buy list.;neutral
good taste and flavor. But very small jar and went very fast. It is expensive. But I found a cheaper seller. Would like to use this product but being on a fixed paycheck can't afford it.;neutral
We did a blind taste test of 6 cocoa k cups in our household.  This was middle of the pack.  Ok, but not our favorite.;neutral
Its passable but lacks full flavor and is weak tasting. It does not taste like a donut with a custard taste--far from it. It is better served black as is.;neutral
well if you like the malted balls it's okay....way to many of them and not enough of the better candy.;neutral
Excellent shipping and absolutely what i wanted.;neutral
I liked it enough but wasn't my favorite.  I wasn't just bowled over with the taste to be honest but I don't like spicy soups;neutral
I like mine a little green. These were already ripe;neutral
The coffee was good tasting just a little weak.  The pods were not full enough and I had coffee grounds in the package as I opened it.;neutral
Some of the cups don't work correctly in the machine,  but overall they taste good.;neutral
These were only fair. For the price I could do better at the grocery store were I can be sure they are good;neutral
I ordered Zesty Italian and this is not bad, but not what I was looking for;neutral
It was nice to be able to try all of them, but there were only 3-5 that I enjoyed...good way to figure out your preferences, but not the best combo IMO;neutral
It's just OK.  Not really a taste I will go back to.;neutral
WAY too thick for my family. My kids will not eat this nori and they love nori. It tastes great but it is thicker than I've ever experienced.;neutral
I'm not a fan of the original cheez its, and while provolone was better, it got a bit overwhelming.  I'd still prefer the specialty flavors, like duoz, zingz, and Grooves.;neutral
Tasted good, but too many carbs for use as a part of a Type 2 diabetic diet.;neutral
Tastes like moldy towels smell.  The bag worked it's way to the back.  But they could be fine examples of Goji but not my thing.;neutral
I usually luv chili mango but this stuff is whoah pretty cover with chili. Mangoes are okay. Quantity was too much;neutral
"Not quite what I was expecting but it's ""OK"".";neutral
"thought my husband would enjoy for a easy meal ;  he said it was ok nothing special .";neutral
Ok product HOWEVER some of these are very hard.  Taste is nice  but I will not order these again for concern they could hurt my teeth.;neutral
The aroma was not as strong as I hoped. It does not seem to be as fresh as it should be.;neutral
This is okay, nothing to write home about.  Still seeking great tea, so I guess I'll have to make a trip down to the Asian part of town to shop.;neutral
I  like the soda overall but it did have an odd taste and not very fizzy.;neutral
Something seems to be missing int the Taste. Not as good as Crosse and Blackwell, But I cant fault their Pickled Onions (they are the BEST);neutral
Bought as gifts, couple bottles leaking. Taste ok.;neutral
I like they are organic and in a bpa free can. Flavor isn't much and they are kinda mushy.;neutral
it doesn't really taste like hazelnut;neutral
Should have bought fine ground.  Don't pour out of pepper shaker.;neutral
"Not as fond of these as I thought I would be.  A bit of a ""plastic packaged"" flavor.";neutral
Doesn't come with a pump.  Had to pour it.  Great stuff, but would have been better with a pump.;neutral
I received butterscotch instead.  I really think dark chocolate would be better, but the butterscotch taste really good.;neutral
pretty good except the taste is too sweet and tastes kind of artificial;neutral
Its hard to find peanut/tree nut-free snacks, so we gave these a try.  My son loved these!  Probably because they're loaded with sugar... these are considered a treat.  And they're $$;neutral
For me the taste is watered down, even at the smaller 8 oz serving and that once taken out of the sealed packaging they have to be used soon or they become stale.;neutral
"its ok, I read a lot of reviews and with great reviews I had to try it. Its not as fantastic to me as others claim. My choice is Gold selection.
Bold real coffee taste.";neutral
Received a few days ago. I love it!;neutral
This was the first time I bought Christopher Bean Coffee.  I was not impressed with the spice in the coffee.;neutral
I purchased this product as liquid egg nog has such a short season in stores.  It is just okay when mixed well with a milk product, but I will still opt for the liquid every time.;neutral
Good product but verydisappointed in the size for the price.  I feel you should get a tad bit more for your money.;neutral
Not particularly strong. I suppose I expected more potency;neutral
Great stuff but your gettin really cheap with the noodles;neutral
great products, but the starch still caused pain and inflamation;neutral
It's ok and for a competitive price, but nothing special in terms of taste;neutral
These started out very tasty but very soon I was picking up an after-taste that reminded me of a propane grill  They're ok but certainly not my favorite brand.;neutral
This coffee was ok if you like your coffee very light. I like dark roast and this was more like tea.;neutral
I enjoyed these cookies, but found the vanilla flavor slightly chemically.;neutral
I bought these to compare to some I was making.  Turns out that I liked mine more!  These were good enough to buy but considering the cost of shipping, I would not buy again.  Fermenting is my new hobby.;neutral
Needs a lot of salt, but pretty good.;neutral
I love earl gray tea this tea is average I love earl gray tea this tea is average  I love earl gray tea this tea is average;neutral
These were not a big hit in our house. The package is very large and difficult to consume before they go stale. Also, they're too big for my 1 year old son to eat.;neutral
This salt does not work well in our very nice salt grinder.  I would not purchase again.;neutral
Protein content is great, the problem I have with these are the texture....kinda gross.;neutral
This was okay, but after tasting this I realised that I liked the bottle instead of the can kimchi;neutral
67 ounces! I'll have to invite the whole apartment building over for dinner.;neutral
nice strong tea package was damaged and some on the tea leaked out but all in all good tea;neutral
It's fat free mayo.  What can I say.  It tastes like mayo and is fat free.;neutral
the area for the little water pool leaks. had to buy some apoxy to fix it;neutral
Ho hum - I guess it's good that it has no robust flavor.  Try it.;neutral
I like this as a healthy snack - comes in a package of 2 bags - way too much.  I still have a bag from a few months ago.;neutral
I neither love it or hate it. I prefer other sauces compared to other brands.;neutral
Pretty good flavor, but you need to use quite a bit, so it's kind of expensive.;neutral
They should have named this clove spice tea. The clove overpowers the cinnamon.;neutral
These were OK but not something I would order again.  Van's has good products.  These just weren't for me.;neutral
Needs to have lavendar to be a real Herb de Provence blend.  I had to buy the lavendar separately :(;neutral
It is good for instant noodles. Check it out though, this is SPICY lip-burning, steam out of your ears hot. It'll take some getting use to if you like regular ol' ramen.;neutral
Does the job, but my husband prefers the Russian stuff.;neutral
I prepared the noodles per directions, and they still tasted funny to me.  Wish I had liked them better.;neutral
I was very disappointed in the flavor;neutral
"I enjoy the taste but some bits were very hard to eat being they were very tough...others, just perfect.
They need to work on their quality control!";neutral
It's good, but I can get almost the same drink for less $ by steeping Hershey's cocoa in hot water and filtering it. I prefer coffee and tea. I like this but I probably won't buy it again.;neutral
My husband was dying to show me the hot cocoa in a k-cup.  He didn't realize it was just instant hot chocolate...  This isn't bad, but I would just make the extra effort and make real hot cocoa.;neutral
I have just not found a recipe that makes this sas good as I think it can be.;neutral
Seems like I need to use lots more of product to get a flavor to come out. Not so sure about this one. Liked Skinny Girl better or even the brands at Walmart;neutral
This is a fair coffee.  I have had better but would buy again for the value.  A little bitter but drinkable.;neutral
Very strange aftertaste. I was disappointed.;neutral
These were alright for a little sweet crunch.;neutral
I dislike the taste of this cocoa mix. I'm sure the quality is very good, though.;neutral
"okay
not that flavorful
came on time
already finished the package
kept me warm during the winter days
will buy again if nothing else available";neutral
not enough information or directions - and I would like to find out how to do it with a different flour like carbquick;neutral
Its really just seltzer in a new can.;neutral
God but a bit too greasy for my taste.;neutral
super pricey for the amount provided. Held up  in shipping to an FPO.;neutral
These are great kit kat raspberry flavor but they arrived all melted, remelted and solidified.;neutral
Timothy's coffee is fine - generally speaking.  I prefer my reusable filter (k-cup) and use my favorite ground coffee.  All the blends taste pretty much the same as far as K-cup coffee is concerned.;neutral
"Its just not right.  Unfortunately this product is made in China.  Weird but true.  I think my food should come from North America at the worst....except for bananas! ;)";neutral
It has a weird taste. Nothing like a cantaloupe. I can manage to eat it but would not recommend.;neutral
great product. however packaging totally damaged and dented all the cans beyond repair;neutral
but the packaging sucks.  the box was soaked in oil.  There were no obvious holes or other problems with the box but somehow one container leaked even though it was still sealed on the top;neutral
It is really good tea however it is very expensive and not worth the price.  I would not buy it again because it is really too expensive for the amount of tea in the bag.;neutral
It ok on flavor. Not my favorite but that just my taste.;neutral
3 stars because I expected more watermelon flavor.;neutral
All of mine expired 30 days after I purchased... watch the date! I love these chips & have gone through half so I doubt I'll be able to return. They are hard to find locally.;neutral
I like the convenience of the squeeze bottle. It is a good size. There isn't a lot of taste to this product.;neutral
some of them die very quickly even though instructions were followed;neutral
Too sweet and needed to be cooked .  Used as instant was too raw and crunchy;neutral
Not much coffee in each k-cup.  If your brewer has multiple settings, it makes a decent small cup.  On medium or large it becomes watery and bitter.;neutral
I have been looking for this for a long time.  Never thought of looking on Amazon, should have know I would find it here.  Very tasty and just what I was looking for.;neutral
It is okay. We thought it was going to be a huge hit in my house, but we love it but not thrilled with the taste.;neutral
VERY TASTY BUT BE CAREFUL OF EATING TO MUCH  OR YOU WILL SUFFER THE CONSIQUENCES  EAT ONLY VERY SMALL PORTIONS TO EXPERIMENT.;neutral
Was given as a gift-the recipient did not like two of them but did like the Mexican hot choc.;neutral
This is a very nice, tasty snack cracker. It's just way too expensive compared to similar products one can find in any health food store.;neutral
Doesn't last very long in flavor.  However it quenches a dry mouth.;neutral
Some are ok, some are not great, recommend stirring after brewing, kids seem to like them.;neutral
I liked the taste of these but I am not use to that much salt. I ended up giving them away. If you like salt, go for it;neutral
I am not a matcha conisseuir, but I ordered this and some cheap matcha and I can not tell the difference.  So save the $ and buy cheaper.;neutral
Seemed like there wasn't much in the box.;neutral
I have not tried this yet, I bought it for a gift but it looks like it will work great. I like that it can be used over and over again.;neutral
I didn't find these quite as tasty as McVitie's Digestives.  These seemed drier to me and not very rich at all, but I didn't try dunking them in tea & maybe that's what I should have done.;neutral
Great value pay but need more cookies.  I was left with the crackers.  The kids ate all the cookies;neutral
I will never order from this Provider again I did not get a tracking number until I asked for it. Plus it is taking a long time to get my Honey. Great Honey by far the only positive.;neutral
kind of weak tea, as opposed to the stuff I get at my favorite Japanese restaurant.  But they are similar enough to recognize that they are the same thing;neutral
I am used to King Arthur Flour so when I had a chance to try White Lilly here on the west coast I was thrilled after hearing all the hype from southern bakers....ahhhh, I'll stick with KA.;neutral
I hike a lot. Not bad for what it is. Throw it in you're non-namebrand specific, hydration pack and it keeps you going, more or less. I keep one or two in my hump all the time.;neutral
Taste fine but, cost too much for instant coffee.;neutral
The price was good but the caramel was starting to get hard.  Only three stars because they were not fresh. No complaints, other than that.;neutral
I did not like this product so much because of its high chewiness level.  It sticks to my teeth and have to work to get it out.;neutral
I like it but unfortunately it has alcohol on it .;neutral
Tastes a bit grassier than the bottled version.;neutral
It is rather strong tea compared to other Genmai Green Tea. It will make a good tea when you brew in a large mug, not a tea cup.;neutral
Chips were good but pantry shipping broke open bag and chips were smashed.;neutral
One jar was excellent and the other was stale throughout. Amazon refunded me quickly for 1 jar. 2 good jars would have been 5 stars. Check the dates before opening.;neutral
"This is sweet, but not what I would call ""syrup."" No wonder you have to use four pumps per cup of coffee!!!!!!";neutral
excellent product, but others at a fraction of the price  are just as tasty. That is the reason for the low rating.;neutral
Too sweet for me and not much fruit flavor... also made with corn syrup. I am disappointed in these, as I was expecting them to be the same quality that most TJ's products are.;neutral
Pretty good but I prefer Wild Bills instead;neutral
This is one of the best gluten free hamburger buns on the market. A little dry to eat, but somewhat soft, too (unlike most you buy);neutral
I was not expecting so many weak coffees.  Some tasted so bland I had to throw it out.;neutral
Not a lot in the box for the price and many items were a single piece of candy. I wouldn't order it again.;neutral
Don't care for the taste.  mixed with orange juice it is good.;neutral
Would have fine, however they tasted some what stale.;neutral
I have not cooked with it yet, but the plastic package came opened. I am not sure if I can still return it. I'm a bit disappointed.;neutral
shipping time was excellent but Teff is not what I was looking for although it tastes very good, I was looking for a product for making  soy-free vegetarian burgers;neutral
Ummmm. It tastes strong but it doesn't taste so good.;neutral
I was not overly impressed with this item, Same taste as Starbucks.;neutral
Not as good as other Yogi teas. Sorta, meh in flavor. Surprising. Glad I just bought ONE box!;neutral
I bought these to make almond milk. The almonds don't soak up water like the organic ones I usually get, even if I soak them for much longer. The nuts alone are softer than I prefer.;neutral
Nuts were kind of hard and chewy. But the candy coating was very good.;neutral
Disappointed it does not have the Kerig symbol on top.  My Kerig will not accept this brand.;neutral
I've used PB2, which started to have an odd sweetness to it - so, I ordered a drum that could last years. It definitely tastes like peanuts and nothing else. However, for my tastes, it needs salt.;neutral
The jasmine in the Twinings variety pack I buy locally is better.;neutral
This was a gift for my daughter-in-law and she's not yet let know how she likes it.;neutral
On the tart side and short shelf life.;neutral
Its a decent product but way overpriced for the amount you get. Used 4 cans in a week and really didn't make that much popcorn, its back to store  bought butter spray for me.;neutral
I like that this gum is healthy and good for the teeth. The price is pretty good when purchased in bulk on Amazon.  My kids complain that the flavor does not last long and I agree.;neutral
The strange taste is present in baked goods which I purchased to replace the regular sugar . Haven't figured out how to overcome this issue.;neutral
I purchased for my husband who is a connoisseur of honey and he said this wasn't what he expected.;neutral
Decent coffee,but its a little more acidic than I like my coffee.;neutral
I love most of the Simply Organic spices, however, this one is not strong enough. I need to use quite a bit to get close to an onion taste. I probably won't buy again and wouldn't recommend.;neutral
My kids don't like this flavor but they love the strawberry.;neutral
Not too strong,not too weak. This is the coffee I buy my wife for her mornings. It is probably the simplest k cup brew,but sometimes that is all you might want.;neutral
Nice, but u are picking chia seeds from your teeth all days long afterwards!;neutral
A nice quality product at a good value.  I personally didn't like the strong cumin flavor but others may enjoy that.;neutral
Overpriced, but good Yerba. I'll stick with the others as I don't notice this tasting superior over other brands.;neutral
I have yet to try this. My friends like it,  I will try at a later date.... I am looking forward with great expectations.;neutral
This product is much hotter than what I had experienced with the brand in the red tub.  This is probably more authentic....but for me a little goes a long long way.;neutral
I prefer a strong, bold blend and thought this would be but isn't...will drink these samples but wouldn't order for me.  Probably ok for someone who likes a very mild blend.;neutral
I love grape laces but these were stale and smashed togeather.  I love Gustaf's candy, but this was way outside the loop.;neutral
Flavor seems bland. Watch pricing. Can jump from a great savings to costing more than my local grocer.;neutral
flavor not quite right- prefer the chocolate;neutral
Being limited so much on HCG diet I looked forward to using this to help.  But somewhat disappointed.  Just an OK product.;neutral
Not very tasty, smaller than ones Ive purchased from other vendors;neutral
Better than all the NeruNerunerune sets I have tried;neutral
Flavour doesn't last too long, but they are tasty.;neutral
OK, but a bit small, not enough salt for my taste and a few not opened.;neutral
"Newer order chocolate bars during summer time!
Arrived as bags of liquid with ants inside a package!";neutral
These have come in handy. Only one thing, when I first got the box i counted them, twice and it turns out I was short, by one. I wonder if every box they send out is missing number 180.;neutral
very important part of diet, quick to make..it is ok....for steamed veggies or chips dipping;neutral
I buy these because they contain neither wheat, nor corn, nor soy, nor canola/peanut oil, although they do have potato.  They taste good.;neutral
The cocoa itself was fine but it was packaged with some heavy items that crushed the container. I had to throw out about 1/4 of the cocoa as it was unsalvageable.;neutral
"It's pretty good, not particularly spicy, very sweet, a little powdery on the tongue.
Maybe I need to mix it harder, or boil it or something.";neutral
Packaged great. Poor thing died. That's my fault though. Will try again later.;neutral
I expected a bolder flavor due to the reviews. It was ok- nothing special. I sprinkled it on brisket and smoked it. I wasn't impressed with the seasoning. I'm better off creating my own rub.;neutral
I didn't like this that much--the taste was kind of bland and it made my hands sticky.;neutral
a little too sweet for me, good fruit flavor;neutral
Yes, it's sea salt but I don't think it warrants such a high price - after all sea salt is abundant on this planet. I imagine that most of the cost is profit.  It is not that special.;neutral
great buy i still drink a lot of water i m hopping there working;neutral
I tried it, but I see no difference in this and regular butter.  I will save my money and buy butter at the grocery store.;neutral
This is a very pricey dark chocolate orange. The flavor is excellent but I could not detect the orange flavour that was suggested. Great taste but, again, were they worth the price and the wait? Not to me.;neutral
dissapointed in the flavor. they were a little flat;neutral
"I'm not sure why, but this did not taste like regular Tang. Very weak orange flavor...kind of ""thin"".
Not sure what went wrong there.";neutral
These are okay, but I expected them to be like Percy Pigs, and they don't have the same foamy quality.;neutral
He gives it a 3-star, but then went and opened another.....so it may be a 4.  Individually wrapped, spicy flavor.;neutral
It arrives hard as a rock, but once you microwave it, it softens up. It's a bit greasy.;neutral
Dark magic is aright not the best but not the worst :/;neutral
I like the product, but deducted two stars because of rough handling and shipping. Not just once, but last few shipments have had many broken crackers.;neutral
Disappointing. Not nearly as strong, dark, and robust as I had expected.;neutral
I like it but the peanut butter cups are gritty and don't melt into the hot chocolate so I really don't know how to feel about this product.;neutral
like to keep this around and it has a long shelf life, doesn't have any of the negative value sugars that some of the premix has;neutral
This tea is very nice but not as tasty as Taylor's of Harrogate, which we found we prefer as a breakfast drink.;neutral
It really is ONLY good with a fatty/salty sandwich.  Great with a Reuben.  To just drink - never.  I won't be ordering this again.;neutral
I do like that its loaded with fiber.  but it has a weird taste. IMO. too expensive to buy again. I do like that its loaded with fiber.;neutral
Too expensive but the taste was fine.  I don't plan to buy again.;neutral
Great Cinnamon taste without too much bite, but flavor doesn't last long at all. I'd say the flavor lasted around 15 minutes. Texture is good, same as normal gum.;neutral
Enjoyed the almonds but found that they are not gluten free as some I've had before. My husband was not able to eat them. The candy coat was thicker than I prefer. Will not buy this brand again.;neutral
so delicious and fresh! water tastes amazing;neutral
Although it only has 1 gram of sugar it's too sweet for my taste.;neutral
Not the best tasting coconut product, I prefer the stuff in cartons (Arroy-D);neutral
Not worth teh money. Strawberries are limited in quantity and size.;neutral
not sure how to compare - stiff but work;neutral
Not very flavorful.  Children didn't like them.  Had to throw them away.;neutral
Pretty good, I have had better but like convenience of delivery.;neutral
I have eaten this beef stew for years. when I got this though, it was rather watery and the beef chunks have been replaced by lumps of hamburger.  Disappointed.  Cancelled my subscribe and save subscription.;neutral
Like most low carb substitutes for pasta--it's just not the same. On the other hand, I prefer it to the sheritaki noodles. Good source of fibre for those eating low carb.;neutral
Not as strong flavored as I'd like.  To be able to taste it your drink is WAY too sweet.;neutral
OVERPRICED at 2x more than regular. Tastes ok.;neutral
It is necessary to mix them into a hot drink with a spoon in order to get them to dissolve. Eventually. Otherwise, the taste is okay.;neutral
"Disappointed ;/ great flavor, but has a very sour  aftertaste!! Looks like bad quality";neutral
This rub is  highly seasoned and is too strong on thin cuts of meat,ie ribs and steaks. Be careful and use sparingly. It will add too much salt and heat for thin slices of meat.;neutral
Doesn't perform as well as the hype.;neutral
almond s were good.  found better pricing at costco.;neutral
Nothing like buying this expensive product only to realize you no longer love buckwheat as a stand alone cereal.;neutral
Didn't like this one, I like most of this brands Chocolate, but this one was different;neutral
Takes a few bags per cup to get real flavor.;neutral
Very strong minty tooth paste flavor. Works if you add a teaspoon of milk chocolate chips or 2 bakers squares to compensate.;neutral
I did not care for the taste of this but I'm sure it is a matter of opinion. It is very much like steak sauce & if you cannot eat high sodium you may appreciate it's use.;neutral
Nothing wrong with the quality of the product, but dissapointing in the proportion of chile to tomato. This is more a tomato product than a chile product--same as Rotel brand in the local stores.;neutral
There were far more flavored cups than I would like. The coffee's all right though.;neutral
Meh, not as much flavor as i thought, did fill my hunger however;neutral
I really liked the idea, but even after shaking vigorously the bulk of the soup still sits in the bottom and has to be eaten with a spoon, which defeats the purpose of soup on the run.;neutral
Too much vinegar for me but a good kettle chip.;neutral
I prefer the Campbell's steak and beans variety;neutral
It's the same taste as the regular green tea.  Kinda expensive but not bad.;neutral
Not my favorite, pretty fishy... I gave them away and my cat loves them!;neutral
Good tasting cereal but they should add more raisins.;neutral
was to sweet does not need the sugar;neutral
Good product, however, too expensive.;neutral
Really rubbery and spongy ...pretty salty, as well. Will not buy again.;neutral
These are delicious, just a tad overpriced!;neutral
Always have loved the banana flavor Laffy Taffy the best but these could be fresher. I can taste the plastic wrapper with the banana flavor.;neutral
Not what I had expected.  Not as good as Matcha Green Tea Powder.;neutral
There was a good selection, some were broken, the items were not packaged well enough.;neutral
I got this for a friend and she is happy with this product so I am also, good quality, pricey;neutral
I struggled to find onion or onion flavor in this pie.. it was 'ok', but nothing to get too excited about.;neutral
The contents is good but the smell is not the strong.;neutral
Good pesto.....but VERY pricey through Amazon.  You can get this way cheaper elsewhere;neutral
The person I made these for didn't care for them.;neutral
Don't get as much of a up as I do from 5 hour energy.;neutral
I have only ordered this once. There was a tablespoon or so of fat and about 3 tablespoons of liquid, so about 12oz of beef. Flavor was a little off but OK as an ingredient.;neutral
Small and very dry. Vanilla flavor was on point. Blueberry ones were lacking in flavor. Expensive for what you get.;neutral
Ended up having too much sugar for me and not that much more protein than other cereals without the claim of protein.;neutral
It is just okay.....others around me think it is great...but it is ho hum to me.;neutral
Very expensive. I found some others at www.skinnynoodles.com. Very affordable.;neutral
These two blends smelled great, but the taste did not hold up in the cup. I would not purchase them.;neutral
Made me feel jittery.  No good.  Stopped taking the product immediately.  It may work but didn't like the feeling at all.;neutral
The bottle is very tiny but sauce has a kick but I wouldn't buy it again;neutral
IF YOU WANT TO ORDER KIND BARD GET THE ALMOND AND COCONUT ONES...THEY'RE THE BEST! THESE ARE MEDIOCRE IN FLAVOR;neutral
wanted to try new flavors, but wasn't a fan of the soda flavors.;neutral
Not one of their better meals, in my opinion.;neutral
Different samples of coffee than advertised. I wanted flavored coffees but instead many different samples of decaf but few of them were flavored. Disappointed!;neutral
this gum is ok, get hard really fast and flavor does not last nearly as long as Orbit gum does.;neutral
Veggies serve of keeping one from binge eating at night. Good deterrent for overeating.;neutral
Very tasty! These need to be made in bigger cans, and released in store.. Because they're quite expensive buying it this way, for the price.;neutral
IT WAS OK NOTHING GREAT AND THE JUMMIES WERE ALL STUCK TOGETHER, NO TASTE;neutral
I love spicy Thai food and was hoping this would live up to it.  It didn't.  I used the whole jar and it was only a tad spicy (like jalepenos instead of banana peppers).  Good stuff but needs to be spicier.;neutral
I prefer the Tully's House Blend Decaf;neutral
It did not help me too well with the pain!;neutral
Mostly apples. They taste good but this is pretty pricey for 8-% apples and 20% other fruit.;neutral
I was expecting stronger flavors.  It wasn't anything special.;neutral
They arrived looking close to expiration.;neutral
I need recipes or something for how to do these, because they've no taste.;neutral
It's a very unique taste. I'm still undecided whether it's 'good unique' or 'bad unique' yet.;neutral
Very small kernels which means small when popped. Tastes like any other popcorn. Nothing special.;neutral
Ok for a sugar free candy, but IMO it is not even close to being as good as some  of the sugared root beer hard candies. Won't purchase this product again.;neutral
pops up the way it should but not the best quality popcorn.;neutral
Maybe I should stick with the Kind fruit and nut bars because these granola bars seem like chewing on straw...and the flavor is just ok.;neutral
You have to drink a lot for any effect, I suppose. U will not re-order. It doesn't taste bad.;neutral
I was disappointed in this vanilla bean powder. It was expensive and it takes a lot to flavor the coffee I brew.;neutral
This is good stuff but it's only 1 oz! You can use it 2 or 3 times and it's gone! I recommend Cook's Organic Vanilla Powder instead as you get a lot more bang for your buck.;neutral
"This is a processed item. No matter what "" flavor "" you get they all taste the same. It is convenient.";neutral
They are OK. Kind of like dried cranberries. I'm trying to find a recipe to use then in, but they aren't something I'll probably buy again.;neutral
Way too expensive for how much you get.  I use it in smoothies and I ordered 2 and they lasted less then a month.  Tastes good, not quite as strong of the flavor either.;neutral
a little pricey but great for birthday parties and the choclaate is very good;neutral
I did not have good luck with this item.;neutral
These are good walnuts but overpriced compared to what I buy At a box store near home.  Theyre not organic or anything special.;neutral
These were too big, no joke....I didn't care for three cookies in one cookie...should've just put the chocolate cream on the white cream with no additional cookie in between....not my favorite.;neutral
Too many strong flavored samples included, only about 50% of pods were crazy pods or other flavored. I was disappointed.;neutral
I've had roasted chestnuts before, and really enjoyed them. I was a little surprised that these were wet and creamy.;neutral
"Just ok tasting with no peanut butter flavor mostly coconut and WAY TOO HIGH in Saturated Fats!!!! :(
14 grams of Sat Fats!!!!!!!!! Wish I knew ahead of time, I would not recommend.";neutral
Not very sweet so use it only for baking.;neutral
Same soup. Convenient to heat. But excessive plastic packaging.;neutral
They were good but found them cheaper at my local store.;neutral
I can smell the spice, but the pumpkin flavor gets lost.;neutral
for diet chocolate its good. honestly didn't like the flavor anywhere near nutella.;neutral
The tea was acceptable but lacked depth of flavor.;neutral
"I liked this product and found it easy to use and easy to store.
I wished it had a richer flavor.";neutral
I don't care for it as much as other brands.;neutral
I liked the Folger's classic coffee better than the Livrly Columbian;neutral
When I saw the outer bag different than past, I was immediately skeptacle.  Same flavor, if not the same, didn't notice.  Didn't like being shown one item and then sent another.;neutral
These aren't bad, but as Murphy's Law would have it, right after receiving the order, I went to Costco and saw 3lbs for $5.49.  I bought them to discover the were slightly salted, but I'll live.;neutral
"This aspartame is somewhat lumpy, and the lumps
do not dissolve quickly.

I've seen aspartame without lumps.

I don't know why someone down-voted me.  My review was simple, relevant, and true.";neutral
It's fairly good. Has a slightly bitter aftertaste but perhaps that is just me.;neutral
most cans came dented a bit , this compromises shelf life.;neutral
This cooks nice, a good way of sneaking vegetables into your kids.;neutral
Good when brewed correctly, but do not let it brew too long. It gets bitter quickly. That is a huge problem for me, because it is almost impossible to complete a task in a timely manner.;neutral
It does taste like mango, but I find it too sweet.  Others I have had are much more robust tasting.;neutral
So if you want non-organic cranberry juice, this is probably good, but I thought I was getting organic and it's just not, is all. It seems to happen a lot with Amazon, unfortunately.;neutral
Its god awful nasty if u try to drink it with a 8oz cup of water, i just mix a small amount into my salad.;neutral
It is non-GMO and that is great. But not best Non-GMO we have tried.;neutral
Very hard shelled.  Hard on the teeth. Great flavor. I suck them down a couple of layers before chewing.;neutral
Not the same product as they sell in Ontario, okay taste.;neutral
I enjoyed them, but I don't know if I would order them again.;neutral
This is just ok.  Using it for a coffee drink just isn't doing it for me :(;neutral
1/3 less fat but I used twice as much as regular to try to get the same intensity of flavor.  I'm going back to regular.;neutral
All good stuff, but priced higher than in stores when I find it;neutral
"it reads "" Product of China, packaged in U.S.""";neutral
Expensive for what it is but does the job. Fine Kosher salt works just as well and much cheaper.;neutral
Good go to lunch with rice if I'm in a hurry.  I leave in can in my desk at work.  Lower in fat thatn the other canned chilis out there and lots of big chunks of meat.;neutral
These cookies have a good lemon flavor,but are a bit soft for my liking, but with a cup of tea, they are the right size for a quick snack.;neutral
YES!!...was well liked by person!!.....;neutral
Kona coffee is one of my favorites.  But this Aloha Is Coffee did not taste fresh.  It's expensive, and I will not buy it again.;neutral
KIND OF TASTELESS ! I like my anchovies strong - my wife would say disgusting. But it is a matter of taste, so I will not be too disparaging.;neutral
These pizzelles  - to our family's tastes - where too thick and chewy. For us, the Reko pizzelles are much better.;neutral
Something just didn't taste right about this oatmeal.  Maybe I am just spoiled by my quaker. lol  Anyway, I gave it away.;neutral
Good fish but can't justify the premium price.;neutral
Because it has black tea in it. I'm sad I didn't see it and it's almost as much as a cup of coffee. I gave it all away. They should change it to green  or white tea. then I'd buy it all the time.;neutral
Tastes pretty good and the oil seasoning was interesting. Wish they could make more quick noodles with better ingredients.;neutral
Flavor okay, but yeah...not as strong as it could be. I used 2 tablespoons in my custard and it seemed to be just the same as 1 1/2 tsp of the regular stuff.;neutral
bacon? Maybe I couldn't taste it through the salt;neutral
The Habanero sauce is delicious. The other two are thin, runny and just meh.;neutral
It's okay.  Truth be told, I like the crystalized version better.  The real draw back though is that 20-25% is really tough and stringy.;neutral
First 3 bites are great . . .the whole bag?  Not so much.  But it's a flavor you don't find out too often;neutral
These are okay, but not the best kind flavor. They are too dry. Also, I wish these didn't use honey because they are almost but not quite vegan.;neutral
If you are an avid lover of salt than this product is for you.;neutral
The tea is good. The green package the tea was in was damaged and inside the plastic bag but brown box carrying everything was not damaged.;neutral
I bought these because they taste great when you buy it from a store and they are fresh, but after receiving this product it tasted stale and not pleasant.;neutral
After comparison shopping these are quite pricey.;neutral
My husband thought they were too dry. I myself liked them.;neutral
This started out OK.  I was looking for a cheaper replacement to Emerils.  However, after a while the aftertaste got to me.  It is much cheaper though.;neutral
It was alright, however my husband had me get a different salt.;neutral
It had a lot of water, not as expected. I think I can get a couple of uses out of it. No issues with shipping. Too pricey for the contents.;neutral
good, but too much liquid in it, when used for baking the results where not top. For the price would expect more marrons and less sugary water;neutral
I like these stuffed leaves, but I had a hard time eating all the packs.  If I could buy two, I would buy them again.  I think they are healthy, and the mouth feel was very good.;neutral
It's nice to flavoring for the dieters out there!! My coworker loved this stuff! Me on the other hand, not so much. It left a film in my mouth.;neutral
We drink Camerons 98% of the time, but this flavor was not quite what I like.  Just a matter of opinion and what we drink.  As always Camerons has good and prompt service.;neutral
"This corn is very tough and doesn't pop up very well.
I need to sit with a paper towel in one hand to spit out all the tough kernels.

I won't be buying this corn again.";neutral
didn't realize the difference between german and other chamomile. Tea has a strong bitter taste.;neutral
Will do in a pinch, better than off the store shelve grinds.;neutral
Tasted okay, but not worth the price.;neutral
look weak if you compare with the same on bags, but tast is ok.;neutral
Expected loose leafs but this is more like gunpowder pellets. Also seems a tad too strong and bitter for a Pekoe.;neutral
Sorry, but I couldn't see or taste the difference between what I bought a Publix or this.;neutral
They taste like candy mostly. Didn't notice any perfume scent though. Even asked my boyfriend in case I was used to it and he didn't notice any perfume.;neutral
I decided to try this spaghetti so that I could compare it to Lean Cuisine.  The Stouffer's was not as tasty as Lean Cuisine and I had to add salt and red pepper flakes so that I could eat it.;neutral
Wasn't awful......This didn't taste too bad and it was crumbly like other reviewers stated, but to be fair this is a health product......If you like granola it's it's acceptable imo...3 stars.;neutral
I've been eating raw almonds for some time so I thought I'd try these.  The only thing I don't like is that they have almost no flavor to them! Not sure why.  Other than that, they are fresh and crunchy.;neutral
For some reason they are not nearly as tasty as the crushed or diced tomatoes. Still ok though.;neutral
The gum is good and I love the peppermint flavor, but didn't care for this. To me it is too neutral, and needs more pop. Back to peppermint! My friend loves this, though. It's all a matter of taste!;neutral
I like Kraft Macaroni and Cheese and hoped this would be a convenient and easy alternative to the box meal. It is relatively quick and easy to prepare, but it tastes excessively salty.;neutral
Flavor gets old after drinking several times. Not impressed with this flavor;neutral
Was a little bit dry compared to the stuff I got from Costco, and it's more expensive. I'm not sure if I will repurchase.;neutral
It is extremely dry.  Dryer than I have had before.;neutral
"This is very good pizza sauce - but the price is
very high.  I bought some anyway thinking that the
taste may be extremely superior to such a degree as
to justify the price - but it was not so.";neutral
A lot too sweet, more so than other brands. I did not care for them. Almost as if sweetness added;neutral
This is okay for a poultry seasoning but I have found others which a prefer over this product. One can never have too many seasonings!;neutral
Taste isn't that great as other brands of simlliar product. Easy to use, but difficult texture. As it sticky. Looks green in color.;neutral
We got tired of this cereal and reverted back to the old, traditional, standby of All-Bran rather than the buds.;neutral
worked once well, not so much the next time. It did work better with home-made nut milk.;neutral
I was expecting a stronger ginger flavor.;neutral
Not the taste is not as good as what I would find in the Dunkin Donut shops.;neutral
Melty and goopy when it arrived. Don't recommend buying chocolate for delivery. Live and learn.;neutral
Gave to daughter so don't know result!;neutral
Works somewhat decently in a hand held/manual milk frother -sounds like it performs better with a steamer frother/espresso machine.  Odd grey-tinted colored almond milk but tasty!;neutral
This is good but very expensive for soup;neutral
The flavor was ok, but it was more dense than expected.  I was hoping it'd be more fluffy.;neutral
Would give it 5 stars except it has too much salt.  Really annoying to people with salt limitations.  Make a low sodium version please.;neutral
Not my favorite flavor, but it did grow on me.;neutral
This tea does not have much taste and flavor.;neutral
The smell was okay but the flower buds  was  mixed with grass and weeds I have to return it  and got full refund refund;neutral
a bit pricey but great size for bath bomb making;neutral
Okay but I didn't love the mix.  It was almost too sweet.;neutral
Xylichew is not as good as it once was. The coating is too thick, and the gum itself (which is the important part) is too soft and sticky.;neutral
"I'm still looking for that rich salt water taffy taste of my childhood trips to the beach.
There are a few good flavors in this batch but only OK.";neutral
This is not the taste of the original Jamaica Me Crazy!!!!  It tastes like cocoanut coffee!!!  Good, but I've got to get used to the new taste.  I don't know if I'll keep buying this or not;neutral
I like these some what, but they have an after taste, so I could not give them a five star rating.;neutral
The vanilla flavoring was a little too strong and overpowering for my taste.;neutral
taste is too.. stevia-ish.  Too sweat and almost feels like splenda water.;neutral
Not as good a Nielsen Massey, but it's ok;neutral
Not too g good.  I will not order again.;neutral
My husband loves this which is why I purchased it. It is a bit salty for me though.;neutral
"My favorite is BABY WHITE, but thought I'd give this a try.
The red hull stays quite visible on each kernel and can be a distraction if looking for aesthetics. The hulls are a noticeable texture.";neutral
Nothing amazing here. Edible. Mushy. Too juicy. Yuk.;neutral
I thought this is the sugar that made the Teavana tea just sweet enough to not overwhelmed the herbal tea but it really did not do the trick.;neutral
They're ok. I like the texture. Flavor isn't that great.;neutral
Have you ever had soft baked Chips Ahoy? That's what these are, but bigger.;neutral
This is a good product for a sugar-free product, but it is not exceptional. It was also not cheap, which would be my one objection to it.;neutral
I bought the gluten free to cut down on fat, they are moist, but I miss the soft, squishy texture and junky, sugary taste of Dunkin Doughnuts.;neutral
THE SAUSAGE ARRIVED AS PROMISED BUT WERE TOO DRY FOR MY TASTE, HOWEVER MY GRANDSON LOVED IT;neutral
Coffee was fine but the price was way too high for 10.3 oz.;neutral
Good tasting nutmeg and I like that it's organic however it's hard to use because it clumps and those clumps have to be mashed to get it to sprinkle.;neutral
Average, I was expecting stronger bergamot;neutral
My gum would be good if fresh but sticks had gotten hard.;neutral
Nothing special, I will use it for popcorn or something, won't buy again not a very buttery flavor;neutral
"taste very good but I really don't know how this detox the body.
No increase of bowl movement, no change in appetite, no change in weight - i don't feel anything.
This really is a herbal tea - that's all";neutral
It's tasty, but it doesn't really taste like violet to me. It's more fruity than floral, but at least it's not soapy.;neutral
good dark chocolate - not whole almonds as pictured, very small pieces. overpriced at $10.00/bar.;neutral
tastes ok, sometimes a slightly burnt taste;neutral
Okay, but not as flavorful as the Vegan Beef.  You have to use quite a bit to get much flavor, which makes it very cost ineffective.  My daughter prefers the vegetable flavored to the chicken.;neutral
I should not complain about sugar-free syrup but I cannot taste strawberry & my tongue and lips get very red.;neutral
Too sweet for me. Cut the sugar content by 80% and I'll order a ton. Better yet, create a sugar-free flavor.;neutral
Great product but not enough cashew packages included, mainly peanuts;neutral
Not a huge fan of the flavor, but it tastes good when it's added to savory sauces in place of peanut butter (like Thai sauces);neutral
Very convenient for quickly preparing a meal, since they are already slices. Taste is good, product arrived in good conditions, but this is a very small quantity.;neutral
A bit disappointed. There are quite a few cider pods, and one rare in this sampling of a decaf blend. I don't like cider. And can probably toss all 12 of them right out.;neutral
OK. Not as much of a mix as those throw away grinders.;neutral
Tast wise okay.  Not the best berry I've eaten.  Most likely will not purchase again.  Berries are hard to chew.;neutral
May be good for trying, but don't buy too many ... you will soon get over the taste and will not want to eat it anymore ever.;neutral
no more flavor after 10 minutes chewing......;neutral
This is good sugar- free syrup, but way overpriced on amazon.  Better to get it in the cereal aisle of the grocery store at a much cheaper price.  I can't eat sugar, so I like to have it around.;neutral
He thought the syrup was pretty good. We purchased this to go with the Lakanto Pancake mix.;neutral
It is a very nice condiment that tastes a lot like fresh peppers ...with a little kick.;neutral
Some are really good, some are really bad, and some taste really stale.  It's a good way to see what you like and don't like with flavored coffees though.;neutral
There's better but this is adequate and less costly.;neutral
It's ok. Tastes good only when I'm hungry. A little too fat compared with other types of pepperoni. Nothing to write home about.;neutral
Gave as a gift and did not use myself, I assume it is okay.;neutral
I guess I prefer the sugar Black Licorice over the sugar free. I am surprised at that because I use sugar substitutes in my beverages. When I order again it will be the real sugar Scotty Dogs;neutral
Buy them in season or they have no flavor.;neutral
personally did not like the flavor.;neutral
husband uses for the single cup coffee maker at work;neutral
Way too much cumin. Kind of ruined it for me.;neutral
Delicious and nutritious but it gives me crazy flatulence.;neutral
If I wanted shells on the seeds I would give it 5 stars. If I had studied the picture, I might have realized they weren't shelled - 3 stars because I have to take part of the blame.;neutral
A disappointing set of soups,  we love Marie's pies and pot pies, but these soups fell short of our expectations.;neutral
Nothing bad to say about this product, but nothing spectacular either, just kind of dead center middle of the road bland;neutral
Product is tasty, but servings are small and box was delivered damaged (several bags had popped open.  Probably will not buy again.;neutral
Needs a little more Cola flavor, otherwise fine product.;neutral
The product itself is fine but a lot cheaper at walmart.;neutral
This fruitcake was ok, but I was disappointed compared to the description and other reviews.  It was not as moist as advertised.  There was lots of candied fruit, which I liked.;neutral
Meh. Nothing crazy good -- average.;neutral
These are good, but would be much better if they were softer. Mine were very hard, and honestly, I didn't want to eat them because of that.;neutral
The honey crystals are an ok sweetener for coffee or tea, but eating it alone tastes like artificial honey.;neutral
It's a fine tea, you just can't taste the peach.  There are other glands that are much better.;neutral
Watered down and thin as paint thinner.  Odd after taste.  I didn't care for it and would not buy again.;neutral
Melitta coffee pods are okay - not great.  When they became unavailable we went to Baronet and are much more satisfied.;neutral
My Vietnamese daughter in law says NO WAY!! but for me, its fast and tastes ok.;neutral
I realize this was suppose to be random but random seems to be 90 % yellow ones........ewwww.;neutral
These were not as good as if I had purchased directly through the bakery.;neutral
Good price but going back to larger pecans from Georgia. These don't hold a candle to those. More expensive but  it;neutral
It is a huge amount of caraway.  Too much to keep fresh for me, so I won't buy again.  As far as the quality, I prefer what I previously have purchased in the store.;neutral
It is ok but the flavor is just not right.  Going back to my old protein powder.;neutral
It is o.k.  Hot spicy,  but not as flavorful as I had read or hoped,  just  a hot taste.  Will not  purchase again.;neutral
This is great to have handy as a sweet cereal and it makes me feel like a kid again. but it has a lot of sugar so back to oatmeal the rest of the week.;neutral
Looking for something without estrogen and I think this is it..;neutral
Too sweet for me, but ok for treat occasionally...;neutral
To me, it pretty much just tasted like regular bbq sauce.  It tasted good, but Ill just buy the normal kind from now on.  I did use it as a stocking stuffer though, and it was very fun for that.;neutral
the small red looking beans are lousy, i take them out and throw them out, the other two beans are good and the dressing is very good, the red beans taste like hard wax, can't imagine anyone liking them.;neutral
Too sweet for my taste.  May use it to glaze something.;neutral
These are OK, but not as good as the beef ones.  The packages weighed only 42 ounces too, not 48 ounces as stated on the package.;neutral
I cant say this tastes like cotton candy or bubble gum. Its more like something in between but not really. I won't be ordering this flavor again. It looked good though.;neutral
This product comes as a random assortment of kcups thrown into a brown box. When it arrived I had coffee grounds pouring out of the bottom of the box. Otherwise, a neat idea.;neutral
Arrived with label only attached with one drop of glue in the center. Makes you question the quality and authenticity.;neutral
Not impressed. Expensive and the Coffee is actually better in McDonalds.;neutral
This is actually instant coffee in a k-cup. Seems a little excessive and a bit deceptive.  But the coffee is great, if sweet.  You do not need to add sweetener or milk.;neutral
Very salty, bland, and greasy, if that's what you like, get these.;neutral
Had a 5 star review, up until the price increased from $8.92 to over $20.00! Still my favorite soda available, especially the clementine.;neutral
Tastes like bananas- I will finish this canister but probably not order again. It was worth it for the discounted price.;neutral
The Thai peanut is garbage, and the lime tastes like chemicals. All the barbecue flavors, however, are fantastic!;neutral
I like 2 other kinds of coconut water better but this one is ok.  I like the larger size as i can freeze it the day before and melts all the next day and i can drink it like a slushie.;neutral
Not really my taste.  Too wet and moist.  Not gross just not for me.;neutral
I don't think they really did anything for my nausea, but they taste great. I don't think I would buy these again.;neutral
It kind of burns my throat.  I add some honey and/or Splenda, but it still burns my throat.  If I mix it with the Unsweetened Classic Chai it doesn't burn as bad.  It's too expensive to waste.;neutral
These are close to the biscuits I grew up with,and they will do in a pinch. I miss my old raisin cookie! These never taste fresh, they are crunchy more than soft. It's a texture thing.;neutral
Does the job. But the taste was ok... I don't know kind of has that packaged chemical smell taste going on. Would I order it again? Maybe not.. but the price wasn't bad so whatevs I guess;neutral
Just OK, good, but nothing special.;neutral
"This were ""many"" broken pieces and quite a bit of chips that had to be thrown out in the bottom along with a handful or two of salt
It was fairly fresh and somewhat bland. Price reflected quality";neutral
The taste doesn't really remind me of green tea, more like white tea mixed with something else. It's okay for the price.;neutral
Wasn't a family favorite, but still a good cereal.;neutral
"Tea seems a bit weak...
I've ordered Taylors brand of tea previously, but this time it seems weak.";neutral
The lolly pops are really cool looking as eggs but, too much and people like the small egg lolly pops would be much of a better seller.;neutral
So-so.  Not the strongest flavoring but it says no artificial flavoring used so that may be why.;neutral
I thought I wanted Decaf but would just rather stick with plain Hazelnut Green Mountain.;neutral
Very artificial smell. The sweet artificial chemical smell kind of surprise that leaves you disappointed. Is it disgusting? No. Would I buy it again? No.;neutral
These bars taste really great, so good that I finished the whole box by myself in 24 hours, ha. The reason I gave only 3 stars instead of 5 is that for about 97 cent an ounce they are way too expensive...;neutral
While the coffee is ok, it seems a bit watery, although perhaps that is because I have been used to Starbuck's double shot espresso.;neutral
Gift for a friend without the red dye.;neutral
I love most WASA crackers but these are almost paper thin and don't have the crisp texture.;neutral
I am kind of disappointed. I was thinking they would have been hotter.  For me, it wasn't hot enough however for other they might be too hot.;neutral
Glad it's organic, glad it's in non-BPA lined cans. Wish they'd use 3-4 more ravioli per can and not quite so much tomato sauce. Still, nice to have a can in the cupboard for a quick bite.;neutral
Disappointed. Was hoping for more of a graham cracker like cookie but its more like a sugar cookie. :( Very sweet.;neutral
I buy a lot of cocao nibs in the 2 lb bag size.  These nibs have the virtue of being inexpensive.  However, the nibs are not very uniform in size and have more shells included than other brands.;neutral
"This coffee definitely has a kick.
Some people like this type of coffee,
but we prefer a smoother taste.  But
it was a good experience.";neutral
Very mild and delicate taste.  The cheesy taste is stronger after frozen.;neutral
A lot of dirty and broken grains. The quality is low.;neutral
It was odd-tasting. Maybe I don't like apricot after all.;neutral
Gave these away and the people liked them. I'm not a yogurt covered raisin fan at all. Glad we're all so different when it comes to food and snacks!;neutral
Like to have on hand for those emergency baking projects.;neutral
"The flavor is EXCELLENT.
Tastes like PIZZA SAUCE.
These HARDER than most PRETZELS could be crushed and used as breading.";neutral
I love peanuts and coconut, but this nut butter is very dense, and didn't please my pallet.;neutral
It is not as good as Starbucks which I am accustomed to but it will do.;neutral
I love this line of products and tell my friends about it often but this flavor was not that impressive to me and I will not be reordering this flavor;neutral
Purchase was as described. Flavor was alright.;neutral
Just started on the product and so far good. A few were not to my liking and that does not detract this.;neutral
flavor is decent but the sucralose is overpowering. I find you need to mix in something to mask it. Spicy brown mustard seems to do the trick but alone it's not that good;neutral
Honestly, Taste good but it is same taste like big train chai tea and the last one is bigger and cheaper.;neutral
"I have found almost all of the ""Green Mountain"" flavors of decaf coffee more agreeable than this more pricy Folgers offering.";neutral
It is tasty, but nothing special.  I probably wouldn't buy it again.;neutral
Good but not as good as the Tullys French Roast;neutral
It was ok.. didn't do anything specific and wouldn't buy again;neutral
Very vanilla tasting but disappointed in size of each one and very thin and dry too. Disappointing for biscotti lovers.;neutral
What is to say or not to say?  It is just overpriced liquid smoke.;neutral
A little thick and gummy but is a reasonably priced sugar free breakfast syrup for those of us watching our blood sugar levels.;neutral
Great chery flavor! It's a great product but really wish the price was somewhat cheaper. I would buy more if it was better priced;neutral
If you enjoy eating bird sized portions, this is great. Not something I will purchase again.;neutral
...Probably would stay with my favorites rather than order the sampler again. Not a fan of some of the blends.;neutral
These are much to sweet for me to drink alone. Okay if I put them in a large strong black coffee. Would love a black coffee version. Overall love this companies products and ingredients.;neutral
Not as good as some of the other leading organic brands, and expensive.;neutral
Good but not as good as Tortuga rum cake. Worth the try though. Just not enough rum flavor for me.;neutral
Doesn't taste any different than a regular Earl Grey tea.;neutral
Although this did taste somewhat like what it was  supposed to be it was lumpy and very pasty. not something I will order again;neutral
"I wanted it for iced tea and tea / so far just iced it and eewww is the only thing I can say.
have not tried it as hot.";neutral
We have always enjoyed Diamond products.  We didn't check the amount/cost.  A lot pricier through Amazon compared to local grocery.;neutral
The taste is okay, however when added to carbonated water, it didn't taste like the typical root beer.;neutral
Yummy but pricey.  I will look for another brand after these are eaten.;neutral
This seasoning would be better if it were ground up finer. It is kind of woody if just sprinkled over food as is. Not sure why the herbs are cut so coarsely.;neutral
I love this product, but this shipment of them was stale:  hard and flavorless.  Will buy directly from jelly belly from now on.;neutral
OK but not as good as the Ginger cookies.;neutral
I order two different types of this product from two different vendors on the same order.  This item took over a week longer to arrive.  These are very dry plums, almost a freeze dried quality.;neutral
The flavor lasts less than 2 min. Other than that not bad.;neutral
Prefer this candy with more sesame seeds and less sugar.;neutral
I like Coke Classic so much that it would be difficult to change to this.;neutral
"great price, not out of stock like stores I go to stores and they only have 1 or 2.
Update- the formula is getting weaker and thus taking a lot more powder.";neutral
I wasn't a fan of the texture or taste, but my vegan mom LOVED this stuff. I gave my bags to her, and she says 5 stars! So there you go. Lol.;neutral
It's ok flavor wise, however when I used it neither the pizza dough or the cinnamon rolls rose at all. Maybe the yeast was old, not sure.;neutral
Texture a little like Cheetos but a little like eating air. Don't know that I will order again as, frankly, the taste isn't that memorable.;neutral
had high hopes, especially for as many as I ordered. Cannot get past the stevia aftertaste. If you mix them with another packet like say crystal light natural lemonade, it is more tolerable.;neutral
Love the taste. Idk about it being a slim tea but it does taste good. I works buy it again just for that!;neutral
I've enjoyed this spread for some time and happy to find it here in the US.  However, it's twice the price of the same exact thing from Cost Plus World Market.  Buy it there for under 5 bucks.  Enjoy!;neutral
Not as bad as DAY TO DAY (d2d are worst, most vile k-cups I have bought yet) but still very weak.  Tasted palatable if you used 2 at 4 oz each.;neutral
The meat and cheese is tasty enough but the pretzels are a bit hard and almost taste stale to me.;neutral
They just taste like regular candy canes with a kick. I was hoping for more of a garlic flavor or something.;neutral
It's a crap shoot whether you will get fresh or dried up.  5 stars if you're lucky, 1 star if you're not.;neutral
"The honey is excellent but the price swings wildly and are unstable.

I'll buy this honey again but not from this seller.";neutral
I had to try these mainly for the comments made about them that I won't go into detail here but will say they were all sincere. I threw the balance in the trash.;neutral
Just ok - not as good as the licorice toffee.;neutral
I had tried the creme brulee almonds and thought that the pecans would be a bit softer to chew and might taste better, the flavor on these is good, but the almonds were much better.;neutral
"I didn't care for the ""Organic Brazil Nuts"" too much. They seemed stale, rancid. I got them for the oil they have and it seemed there wasn't much natural oil left in them.";neutral
This is a little too biter for my taste. But that's just me.;neutral
This is powder in a K-Cup package. It tasted okay, but not good enough to buy again.;neutral
"Good taste but needs more ingredients
Container is never full
Amazon fresh has very few complaints from my household but this is definitely one";neutral
Not as creamy tasting as more expensive brand name powdered creamers. Ok for work place though;neutral
Not bad-but definitely not all that exciting. Tried this along with Tassimo's Gevalia Colombia. Prefer the Columbia. Not sure about all the fuss about 15% Kona.;neutral
Ok pesto, but pesto without garlic is weird;neutral
Smaller than what I thought I was buying...  Very flavorful but not worth the cost;neutral
Based on other reviews I read, I expected a stronger flavor and was disappointed.  Won't be buying again.;neutral
Sort of bland. Have just eaten as a side on a vegetarian plate. Maybe good in an omelette or chili. Love that it's organic.;neutral
These taste great but too expensive . The bags are small and cost too much, but the taste is unmatched from what you can find I the stores.;neutral
I know this is good for you, but not for my taste buds. Sent it back.;neutral
Nearly all kernels popped with or without oil. The popcorn is good, but I really cannot say that it is worth the price instead of a grocery store brand.;neutral
Purchased this before i found out they all would not work in my 2.0 keurig machine... Total bummer because what I did try I liked.;neutral
These are just too salty for my taste. Otherwise I think they are fine. If you like salty, you will probably like these just fine.;neutral
"I thought the word ""capsule"" might mean more flavor, but no.  It's OK, but I like the Bigelow Earl Grey K Cups better.";neutral
Didn't realize how much we didn't like orange juice until we received this. It was so sour and bad tasting;neutral
Coffee was just ok for me.  Would I reorder it?  No!;neutral
Nice, but hazelnut syrup or Frangelico is probably cheaper in the long run and more useful too. I will probably not buy again.;neutral
I thought I would try it. It's easier than brewing a cup.;neutral
This tea is okay for a heavy tea drinker like myself.  I ordered both English Breakfast and Earl Grey and found that I enjoyed the Earl Grey more.;neutral
The Chocolate got thrown away as it tasted like plastic or chemicals!  Would not buy again. I doubt the chocolate would even be safe to eat.  Did hav e fun getting prizes out.;neutral
"seems to be lacking in the ""Expresso"" category.... tastes very weak for a Expresso.";neutral
mostly BOLd flavors this time!!!! usually a great mix however;neutral
The apples were tasty but had a lot of defects.;neutral
Lots of variety but some pretty funky flavors. So far have tried a half dozen and whilst none rock my world, none are undrinkable.;neutral
Cheap, heats quickly and clean up is easy,;neutral
Can't smell or taste any cinnamon at all! Coffee quality ok;neutral
Didn't notice any difference, although don't know how one would.;neutral
Seems like really weak tea. Maybe it's just me as I'm not an experienced green tea drinker yet.;neutral
Just me! I like one flavor at a time with the larger pieces. Cute but won't be ordering them again.;neutral
This tea is ok, but is definitely not meant for tea aficionados.;neutral
THESE ARE OK, BUT DO NOT HAVE A VERY CINNAMONY TASTE.  WILL NOT BUY AGAIN.;neutral
It is good but not great.  We get or at least look over the selection everywhere we go and we have eaten a lot.  This is nothing special.;neutral
I love this type of mushrooms but these were definitely a few days old.;neutral
It's nice to have some avocado honey in the house again (I can't find it locally).  Surprisingly this batch has a hint of bitterness that I don't remember avocado honey having.;neutral
Prefer vanilla biscotti by Folgers. Expected more vanilla flavor.;neutral
Too high in calorie count but it does taste good;neutral
Pretty good if you can't order Mexican or make your own.  Personally, I recommend any standard recipe for Chilaquiles.  Google one!;neutral
Candy tasted like it had been melted then rehardened, the chocolate tasted stale.;neutral
Thought there would be more variety, not entirely flavored coffee. Variety had to read on individual pods. Good for someone who enjoys a variety of flavored coffees.;neutral
It's good, but even in spicy it's not that hot.  It's not as good as Mustafa's.;neutral
I would neither recommend nor reject this product. The packaging coud have been a little better. Would I buy it again? No;neutral
"I am satisfied with the Gloria Jean Variety Pack of coffee,  This allows the consumer to purchase decaf and caffeinated without having to purchase two boxes of each.

Good products.";neutral
"I compare this to Jo's Peppermint Bark and it comes out a disappointing second.  Edible but not ""moorish.""  I will not buy it again.";neutral
This is one of the better Compleats.  Hormel makes a few that are uuuugh.  This one is handy when you are old(like me) and don't want to cook or wash stuff afterwards.;neutral
I guess I was looking for something with more band and omph. It was OK at best- very expensive. Keep this in mind when ordering.;neutral
I found several bad ones, which left a bad taste in my mouth (literally).;neutral
buy only greenmountains coffee - it's always taste like a fresh roasted bean.;neutral
I thought the fruit was too dried out.;neutral
Dry, not as good as some of their other products.;neutral
It was melted together when it arrived. I ordered it after reading about them in a book written by a British author and was curious. Sort of like chocolate covered graham crackers but gritty texture.;neutral
They were okay, but not omg wonderful. I liked the salted caramel flavor much better and I am usually a chocolate lover.;neutral
Not as good as their tortilla soup, not true black beans , more brown amber color beans,  , pretty tasty but a little watery for me;neutral
These were good but not fresh.  The packaging does not seem to be air tight.  If this is new, I strongly recommend going back to the old zip closure.;neutral
Not bad, not good, could use some more kick as the taste alone is not enough reason to purchase this tea.;neutral
No sugar but contains milk. Nice soft raisins but it's a typical muesli, nothing spectacular.;neutral
Tastes ok, but very hard to get it out of the jar without a jackhammer. I have used it on toast and apples..;neutral
Tastes o.k. when toasted .  Not much flavor.....;neutral
The flavor of this tea is not nearly as good as cheaper store brands.;neutral
The color is great. But it lacks the flavor.;neutral
It's alright quality. Didn't work for my body chemistry.;neutral
Flavors seem rather artificial.  Not bad, but hardly exciting.  Would not re-purchase this brand.;neutral
Every shipment I get the oatmeal boxes are open. The oatmeal is still in tact, but with the boxes unsealed it makes me nervous.;neutral
Not as tasty as other cacao powder I have used.;neutral
but these just had too much fat.  The flavor was good and the prep was easy but I couldn't get away from all the fat.  It showed up in the calorie count, too, as you might expect.;neutral
The pouches are pretty small for the price but the tuna is good and there is no water to drain. For a snack on the go these are nice but for at home I will stick to cans for a better value.;neutral
not as strong as my regular chai - different but still good;neutral
I was expecting more of a coconut flavor after reading the reviews.;neutral
Sizes vary. I had one that was the size of melon and another the size of a fist.;neutral
I like this gum but it is very expensive. It's about 1/2 price buying it here on Amazon vs the grocery or pharmacy store.;neutral
Goes well with cereal but very small bag. Tastes like any other granola but I guess the fact that it's natural is worth something.;neutral
Very good product, good service and price.;neutral
It tastes the same as it did when I was a kid...BAD.;neutral
This tea isn't a big deal.  I was hoping to have found a basic but strong and flavorful tea.;neutral
My husband likes this stuff to sweeten and flavor his iced tea, but I won't drink it because of all the additives and presevatives.;neutral
Nothing special, not bad. Missing the special note that better Darjeelings have.;neutral
Get it on sale for value. Tastes fine.;neutral
The coffee is good. But it cant be called a French Roast - just some dark roast.;neutral
It's okay.  My wife was expecting chai latte, but we kept this anyway.  In a pinch you can mix it with frothed milk and get the same effect.;neutral
I have had them before.  They are OK, but nothing great.  I bought them this time in cause we get stuck inside by the winter like last year.;neutral
It would give 5 stars if it had not come from China. I was disappointed, I expected this type of product to be from the USA. The product tastes fine.;neutral
Flavor was good, but it took forever to dissolve in my coffee and tea since the crystals are so large.;neutral
It doesn't seem to have the same taste as the packages and I don't know why.  Kind of bland.  So I spice it up with some other things.;neutral
Packages keep getting smaller and wheres the filling gone to??;neutral
Got some terrible terrible flavors in here in which someone had to  work so make something taste this bad. Better going with a known single type than variety,;neutral
These were grittier than expected & didn't have the flavor I was looking for. I prefer Sunmaid's Jumbo Raisin medley the best and Trader Joe's Jumbo Raisin Medley almost as much.;neutral
I enjoy this coffee occationally, but the office is split right down the middle between Loving and Disliking it. I think it is worth a try. We order this regularly.;neutral
"It seems old Wolfgang and I have a conflict here.
My best guess is, The puckster never tasted this stuff.  Granted, it smells wonderful, my approval ends there.";neutral
Good price, but nut as plump and juicy as I like.;neutral
It is not as creamy and tasty as my favorite brand.  It's missing a touch sea salt and wish it had a glass jar.;neutral
Bought this cause my wife could not find zipfizz at the local Costco .Taste is ok and it is cheaper but i would rather pay more and get zipfizz.;neutral
good but not as sweet and fresh tasting as Swanson brand...they work OK as a base for our smoothies when soaked but not so tasty to stand alone.;neutral
Flavor is pretty blah, but they are ok and totally edible. Don't know if I'd buy again.;neutral
Love the flavor but the packing makes this a difficult to use product. The bags do not re-seal as they are supposed to and there is no proper way to store the opened packages.;neutral
Its alright, not too bad. The taste was bland. Didn't feel like real coconut. I prefer now going to an asian supermarket and buy coconut drinks for 1.50 whenever they are on sale.;neutral
"Great flavor but it leaves a "" its dried"" feeling in your mouth. Love the concept but they need some improvement.";neutral
May have lost a customer, The tips do not seem as strong as previous tips. The packaging is different. Will buy the tips locally.;neutral
Bought these for my four year old son in hopes of replacing the Trader Joes version that are not gluten free. Unfortunately he won't eat them and doesn't like them.;neutral
This is a really small box not worth the cost to me but as a gift for a Harry Potter fan I suppose it is okay.;neutral
Tastes great at first but it looses it's flavor pretty quickly.;neutral
Was very tasty. A little pricey for the amount.;neutral
Not too crazy about this flavor, but will eat it since it has fiber.;neutral
I suppose Ghiradelli is better quality, but it has a different taste I'm not sure I prefer.  I grew up on Hershey's and I lived in Chocolatetown too, so I'm a bit jaded.;neutral
"I think the price is too high but it tastes good.
I bought it because Himalayan salt is said to have more natural minerals and iodine.";neutral
I'll let NomNom keep this one -  not what I expect a fruit cake to be like.  It was rather gummy, but taste was OK.;neutral
Compared to Trident white, these do not last as long. I wanted to try a different brand, but I think I'll just stick to my normal Trident gum.;neutral
Didn't realize these were a weight-loss tea.  Searched for the apple cinnomon flavor I miss and can't seem to find again;neutral
Good but week Beans. Takes more beans to make a pot of good coffee. I have only made about three pots so far.;neutral
I ordered a couple of bricks of a Coffee labeled CDM with the same color packaging as this. I just wanted to see if they were the same. They weren't, and I did like this better than the French Market;neutral
Hormel veggie chili is slightly better, and Stagg vegetable garden chili is WAYYYY better. But add some pan-fried veggies to spiff it up, and put it on buttered toast or steamed rice, then it's all right.;neutral
This mix makes very dry pizza crust. I'd like for it to be more moist and chewy.;neutral
i didn't like these as much as the choc pb or the choc w sea salt.;neutral
Im not thrilled with this product.  It seems to be a little sweet for bread and I can't seem to get a good load of bread out of it.  It always falls in the center.;neutral
It's brown sugar. I like C&H better. I'd not buy this product again.;neutral
This is okay, clear flavor. Peach seems a bit off,can be bitter if brewed very long. Good iced tea, but prefer just adding peach slices to tea.;neutral
I ordered wrong. I should have ordered Second Flush - but the Vahdam Tea people were great and recommended a Second Flush to try next time. I'll reorder from them again.;neutral
Just okay.  Kinda mushy.  Not much chicken in there.;neutral
Its okay I will probably not purchase the product in the future.;neutral
This is okay.  I'll finish the bag but won't reorder.  It is too spicy with very little sweet.  I will try the cranberry nut mix next.  Somebody who really likes spicy would love this.;neutral
Very mediocre pralines, especially if you've ever made your own.  Not buttery or creamy.  Very small pieces of pecans.  Texture is more gritty than creamy.;neutral
Doesnt mix well at all, very chalky!! I added it with my herbalife shake mix and that helped a lot. Might work better with yogurt? Trying to avoid gmos and too many calories;neutral
Broken up but was able to salvage half of the bag.;neutral
My keurig is a 2.0 and so it only accepts k-cups that say keurig on them.  However, I was able to give the other cups to my daughter and her family and they were able to use them in their keurig machine;neutral
great taste's like movie theater pop corn.;neutral
Mixed Reviews.  Not so great taste so I add in crystal light packets to over power the flavor. But it gives off the same energy boosts as a red bull would.;neutral
This product was far to sweet for me and barely tasted like coffee.;neutral
Brought this to work and was not a hit though is individually packaged and probably OK for a lunch box treat or something.;neutral
Pretty good, but not at this price!;neutral
Ok coffee, Pilon or La Llave is much better...;neutral
Yummy, although not pretzel texture.;neutral
Not bad, but I wasn't really impressed with the taste here, although the low hull density feature is nice. Small kernels and average taste.;neutral
The bars are extra small and the bars taste was ok in my opinion. I don't think I'd buy them again.;neutral
"Ordered the 300 tub of ""Assorted"" Received 205 Original, 84 apple, and 27 grape. Nice to get 316 in a 300 tub, however this is a limited assortment at best. A little disappointing.";neutral
Not my favorite but a good change of pace when you're looking for something different.;neutral
Not the same great flavor as the 12.7 ounce glass bottles. Could be because this is in plastic...I will go back to purchasing the smaller bottles as the flavor with those is just delicious.;neutral
Awesome Chips, there were a few I didn't care for and a couple bags also arrived flattened.;neutral
Great price but very bitter and doesn't mix as easily as others but for the price its good for blending.;neutral
Tasty but pic is huge exageraton of amount of fruit;neutral
Except for myself the taste and flavor seem to spicy for the kids.;neutral
good coffee! can't really tell the differants in flavor from each one they all taste the same!!;neutral
Good price, no sugar, are the positives.  The flavor lasts about 4min if you chew four or five pieces simultaneously.  Otherwise the flavor is gone in about a min.;neutral
I'm sure the product is fine, but it doesn't have enough flavor for my liking.;neutral
Okay tasting, I still needed to add salt. I probably won't buy again as it contains corn syrup & partially hydrogenated oils.;neutral
We put these in our antique gumball machine.  The flavor is great but goes away within a couple of minutes.;neutral
Good item, but price just okay when compared to local markets.;neutral
Not impressed, tried a cookie recipe and it was very bland.  Will see if I can find different use in cooking.;neutral
"I guess since StarBucks charges more for coffee I hold it to a higher standard

but honestly, the coffee is just fine.  There's nothing special about it that makes it worth paying extra for";neutral
i don't chew gum but i bought some for my trip to aruba in case my ears clogged up.  luckily they didn't.;neutral
"not my thing
but they are good
packaging on mine was different and I felt like they got old and dry tasting quickly.";neutral
Bars I got were stale, even though the expiration date was quite a way off yet. Gave them away.;neutral
"Too ""earthy"" for our taste. Otherwise as advertised.";neutral
I had a very high amount of unsprouted alfalfa? seeds, more than usual.;neutral
They were a little too salty for my taste. Good quality and pretty packaging though.;neutral
"It does contain salt...65 mg and sugar.  It tastes sweeter than it does ""limey"".";neutral
These are ok, I always buy Kirkland unsalted cashews, these are definitely a step down. I'll be going back to kirkland next time!!;neutral
I love that they are natraul my one son loves it and my other one does not . so it is a hit and miss. Thank you;neutral
Like the powder but the only problem is it does not resolve unless it's burning hot water. It will unresolve itself when the water cools down a bit;neutral
My daughter loves it. Though a great price, overpriced. And it took forever to get.;neutral
It's not bad. Kind of takes on what ever flavor you cook it with. For me, it still cannot replace pasta or ramen noodles.;neutral
some of the cheaper, lower quality brands actually taste better than this.  It did not stand out from the crowd.;neutral
"This is the opposite of Campbell's chunky noodle soup. Almost no chicken in it. Mostly soup.

However, it is convenient and not bad tasting.";neutral
Too acidic for me.  Maybe best that I stick to full body coffee.;neutral
Great chocolates, but next time I'm going to buy from someone else. About half of them were broken when they arrived, which made this whole package a sticky pain in the tookus.;neutral
good stuff just not sure it is any different then the simple stuff.  i use it mostly to change the pH of distilled water which it does as expected;neutral
The gum did not taste super fresh, so I just give it three stars.;neutral
Coffe is not bad, but it takes 5 times LONGER to pull the espresso compared to the neapresso pods. Good crema forms.;neutral
these cookies are tasty, but don't try to eat the whole box at once because you get sick of them towards the end.  This is spoken with experience.;neutral
Tasty.  Not much toffee in it, and very, very high in calories.  This really should only be eaten on the trails, during very high activity.  I fear most will eat this sitting on the couch.;neutral
Healthy product, but won't buy again.;neutral
This tasted great but the cheese stayed runny and never firmed up.  Preparation was also not as easy as expected due the water easily boiling over and making it difficult to modulate properly.;neutral
Wanted to try this because of the content of the noodle.  Found them to be quite bland.;neutral
The flavor is good. I didn't expect the cashews to be so mushy. I would buy again but not often.;neutral
Didn't realize they were so small, but they're ok.;neutral
It's ok. It can't make a bad protein drink taste good.  It does, however, make a good protein drink slightly better.  It adds a slight peanut buttery taste to my protein drink.;neutral
This is okay if you need the convenience, and the salmon chunks are nice, but it's a bit too much like a thick canned soup for my taste. I liked it better heated than cold, by the way.;neutral
The plant is healthy but it arrived with soil that was full of gnats. The pot is really cheap and you will have to re-pot the plant soon.;neutral
Bought these for our front counter for our customers - staff says they are just OK.  They do the trick for a free give a way - I'm sure kids will love them.;neutral
Amazon has a great price on this through Subscribe and Save. I wish they would offer the other flavors, peanut or almond or fruit and nut, that my family prefers over cashew.;neutral
Product arrived quickly and was as described.;neutral
very hard to open must have been 2nds. tasted good though.;neutral
This tuna has a very good texture although it is a little dry however the smell and taste is more fishy than other high-quality  canned tuna  that I've had.  I don't feel that it is worth the high price.;neutral
Not one of my favorites.  I found it fairly salty.  And there aren't many beans, mostly a very liquid spiced spinach sauce.;neutral
by the looks Of these I have not been able to bring myself to even try them;neutral
Usually Kind makes great products but this I did not really care for.  It tasted okay but it was not something that I would want to eat everyday for a very long time like some cereals. I would not buy again.;neutral
You can find these at dollar stores.  We got it to help fill a pantry box, but probably would never purchase regularly.;neutral
"Nothing wrong with it, just don't have high expectation out of it. I say ""high expectation"" as the expectation out of Lindt dark chocolate you find at your local Target store.";neutral
I like a smoother nut butter, this was very grainy.  And to me, it was not a strong walnut flavor.  It was just OK, I will try another brand next time....;neutral
They're good on their own but seem to lose their flavor when mixed with other ingredients. Just okay.;neutral
All xylitols seem to taste the same.  However, this brand is made from CORN, not birch.;neutral
It's ok but I wouldn't rebuy this item. Think the Roland is better and the other people agreed when I served them side by side.;neutral
This espresso is great but I must have read the size wrong because you can get this same size at the grocery store for half of the price. It was my mistake though.;neutral
"It's okay  the directions how to mix it was not the best taste.  Tasted like soap to me so I cut back to two NOT heaping spoonfuls.
The taste got a little better";neutral
I began just replacing my coffee in the morning but then used it as a second cup, no jitters, no hot flashes. No big pick up so how much coffee is in it I am not sure.;neutral
Coarse twigs that do  not soften when cooking. Smells and tastes great when adding to meat dishes or soup;neutral
OK but there are others I like better for the money, like Stone Street Mayan Decaf.;neutral
Tea has great flavor, but did not work for what I had bought it for.;neutral
I liked the fact that the carrots were big and the chunks of chicken it. But, I thought the broth needed more chicken flavor it was kinda of bland.;neutral
Its not great. Its not bad. Its just ordinary. It can't compare to Bigelow Chamomile, but it's way better than Twinnings chamomile. My trouble is that I can't fine Bigelow chamomile on Amazon anymore.;neutral
I love Indian food and there is not a restaurant with 2 hrs drive of here. This product makes a good meal and quickly. I love the balance of spices. I also like to add vegetables to the packet.;neutral
tassimo gevalia is a better espresso when you aren't adding milk - but for cappuccino and latte this works fine;neutral
well...it is runny, gritty, but edible. meh. will not return it, but would not have bought 3 jars;neutral
Way too much cardamom in this, overpowers the other spices. Won't order again.;neutral
Almost harsh, in it's body.  Cost is quite nice- too bad the flavor and aftertaste don't match...  I won't reorder...;neutral
Decent variety, tasty product. Only problem is that the credit for my order was never applied to my account. Otherwise good sample box.;neutral
These actually taste really good, but the pieces are really small, like peanut sized, making it sort of hard to eat them.;neutral
Disappointed...its way too intense, in a bad way, like its old,  probably because  of the roasted part. I can barely taste the hazelnut flavor too. Not sure now what it can be used for: /;neutral
'Bout the same as all the others..blah. Yuk. Seems like Maxwell house is the best believe it or not & cheaper;neutral
Was hoping to like these - sadly , not so much.;neutral
Quite strong! I was expecting something a bit lighter in flavor. If that is up your alley, enjoy!;neutral
I purchased this pink salt because I was told it tasted better than my normal salt water salt .. not true, they both taste similar;neutral
It is what it's suppose to be, but I have to write more words to hit the submit button and I think this will stop my reviewing.;neutral
Not sure what it is supposed to taste like since I am new to low carb but if you order it in the summer time it melts and leaks out of the jar.;neutral
Not produced in US . Clearly misrepresentation .Package said Canada crisp. While apple did test chrisp , it did not taste as honeycrisp i know.;neutral
A little too fruity for me. Maybe I grow into the flavor, maybe not.;neutral
It's animal.  But, it blends well in smoothies.;neutral
Good quality, but melted during shipment. A cold pack was provided in the shipment, but did not fully protect product from melting. After refrigerating upon arrival -- not too bad but certainly not perfect.;neutral
A little strong for me, but I think that is just my personal taste.  Friends told me it was very good and had a smooth taste.;neutral
Used to be great, but my family has noticed Amy's foods are all starting to taste a  bit too SWEET lately. Don't know if Amy's has actually altered their recipes or what, but we're skipping them for now.;neutral
These do not taste that good to me, but I guess I could break off small pieces and use as dog treats.;neutral
Very licorice-y.  Strong flavored.  Personally, I think the price is way too much, but they are very tasty and go a long way.  Keep well-covered so they don't dry out once the bag is opened.;neutral
Not bad, but not as good as regular cheez-it.;neutral
Not as good as I had tasted before kind of bland.;neutral
I didn't like the flavor very much and its very oily;neutral
You know for fake eggs they are not bad, I just can't adjust to an eggless egg.;neutral
"Very, very sweet! If you like sugary gooey cookies and candy, this is the ""granola bar"" for you. It tastes like a desert more than a trail bar.";neutral
THIS COULD BE GREAT CANDY. THEY ADD TO MUCH SUGAR TO THE MAPLE. THE LISTING IS MISLEADING ITS NOT PURE MAPLE CANDY BUT  CLEVER MIX.. IT TASTES OK BUT NOT THE REAL THING;neutral
I really like Ryvita crackers and they are not easy to find.  This one was a little disappointing.  Nothing really wrong with it but the seeds and oats fell off and it was just not that great.;neutral
"Unfortunately, this is not the most delicious nuts.
But I bought a second time - good price";neutral
Too Expensive, tasted ok but I won't buy this again.;neutral
I wasn't crazy about the taste but I drank it.;neutral
I like hers Jalapeno chips better as they are not just hot they have a pepper vegetable flavor. the Prime Pantry price was good. Good heat on these if you only want hot chip flavor.;neutral
This sauce is very very strong. Although it is tasty and spicy, it was very overbearing on the rice. I suggest adding something else to it or using 1/2 the amount.;neutral
this brand of tea is amazing however I couldn't stomach the flavor of this one I'll stick with the coconut chai;neutral
The package I recieved was damaged so I weighed the bags, including the undamaged ones at a whim. All 5 bags were short weighted by a quarter to almost half an ounce.;neutral
This brand of coffee is so very mild that I can't even say whether I like the flavor or not.  I don't have to have my coffee ultra strong, but I do like a rich flavor.  This one just isn't my cup of coffee.;neutral
This was a gift for the in-laws so I don't know.;neutral
Disappointed somewhat with taste but better than most non GMO mayonnaises on the market.;neutral
Boring is not what a chocolate lover wants to hear.  The chocolate is not chocolaty and the white chocolate has no taste at all.  Luckily my son at them for me.;neutral
It's lipton tea... not much else to say. It was 3 dollars at one point tasted as expected.;neutral
I'm not a huge fan of this one. It is probably just the fact that it's awkward to drink flat root beer? If you have a soda stream this might be better when you throw some carbonation on it.;neutral
I can't honestly give a review, because the coffee pods are on the shelf. I have a backlog of pods. This is, however, my second time buying Kona Blend, and it was very good, the last batch I bought.;neutral
As weird as it sounds, it does almost taste like its been a bit burnt by the campfire....lol. It is ok and we'll use it but I won't buy again.;neutral
It's a little weaker than what I had hoped for. I like my dark coffee strong and robust. This is not it.;neutral
other than the seeds I could get the same result with regular vanilla.  Did not find it to be as intense as I imagined.;neutral
These were ok but not as habit forming as the Gummy Bears I also bought at the same time. These may appeal to you if you prefer a slightly less sweet treat that melts slowly in your mouth.;neutral
Bought these for a at home cotton candy machine. They do not work well for it at all. Delicious on their own though. Stick with the jolly ranchers for cotton candy.;neutral
I find myself preferring the Arm & Hammer. This has a different quality or consistency to it that I did not like.;neutral
I'm not an expert on biscuits and gravy regularly, so perhaps this review is a bit biased, but I thought these were just OK. Great flavor, but it didn't deliver with the taste.;neutral
I guess I think Kirkland is cheap crap. But Thiis pepper is ok.;neutral
"This chili is pretty tasty, but it is not nearly spicy enough to be labeled, ""Spicy."" Also, it's very high in sodium since it claims (absurdly) that there are two servings per can.";neutral
Tastes ok, a bit weak.  My wife didn't like at all.  Wouldn't buy again.;neutral
Great cheese but can they make slices of it please?;neutral
a little goes a LONG way... I'm still not sure how to use it effectively...;neutral
I thought the brownies turned out very well. However, the price is not reasonable for one batch.;neutral
Not one of my favorites. I think the product and shipping were just fine, I just did not care for the taste.;neutral
You won't find any chunks of beef in this, but it is a good broth.  This can be microwaved in container.;neutral
"Shipped great - product was delivered as promised.
Flavor was gross!! Did not like the taste at all!!";neutral
The label is misleading. It says chunky, but it's not nearly as chunky as one would believe. The taste is good but not great. I'll eat every now & then just to use, but I won't be buying another case.;neutral
The description sounds yummy. They were not as good as they looked or sounded. Not bad but tastes a little like paper. I prchased a whole box;neutral
I was expecting large (long) sticks, this is the regular size KitKats - 16 to a bar rather than the usual 4.  I think this should be clarified in the product description.;neutral
VERY mild. So I guess if you just want flavor and no spice, this is for you.;neutral
My friend loves these nuts so ordered this type for him as a gift.  I liked the one I ate but I found it to be a bit too much dark chocolate.  Just my taste.  Overall it was good.;neutral
I guess I was expecting to see or feel something different than if I had just bought some organic honey from the supermarket.;neutral
I give the Dreamfields lasagna 5 stars for taste a quality.  I give this method of ordering 0 stars since I found this product and exact quantity for $20 less elsewhere! Ripoff!;neutral
"Decent but slightly ""harsh"" although it does make a relatively ""strong"" cup of tea";neutral
Didn't love the after taste of them but my husband loved them.;neutral
Great but smaller than I expected, went through them quickly.;neutral
It's okaynot as good as Grove Square Hot Cocoa.;neutral
Just OK on waffles..not much flavor, for all of the sugar they added.;neutral
"This product works well in making vegan cheese but there is so little of it for the price.
I would make it often but with the cost I feel limited.";neutral
Too big, each piece. Very strong. Personal taste;neutral
Very small and very sweet but good to test the product before buying the large bottles.;neutral
Lots of clams, however,  find this a tad too watery and lacking spice.  After adding garlic powder it tastes much better.;neutral
It's a decent light roast but I still prefer Starbucks Medium Roast Pikes Place;neutral
Takes half the container to color or flavor coffee.  Tastes good when you can taste it.  Too expensive.;neutral
I feel like they have changed more than the packaging. I used to be able to use one bag and get a decent cup but I have a large mug so I use two. Now even with two the flavor seems very weak.;neutral
Problem is they break easily or are already broken when you open them.  They taste great, however, three stars because of packaging.;neutral
portion is very smalll for the price;neutral
I like this product but it requires a careful celanining cause a couple of times I found hard stems which could breake your tooth. Decided to give a chance to another product now that the price changed.;neutral
i bought this to make a Bransen pickle sandwich.  I enjoyed the reviews on this product more then the actual product itself.  It was good but not great;neutral
There is a lot of sauce and it gives a pickeled taste.;neutral
Good for price, I supposed. Not as much as you'd think. Has all the flaovrs;neutral
Not very exciting.  Half of these went to the local food bank.;neutral
I love poptarts but these are dry as though they have been  stored in the warehouse;neutral
It was ok...just that... I am from the UK and live in the US. It's not the same as a Marks and Sparks or a Fortnum and Mason Xmas pud... but it hit the spot..;neutral
Interesting  but not impressed.  Not very lemony.;neutral
Fair orange flavor not the best but.;neutral
Good instant mashed potato product worth the price I paid but a little strong on the garlic flavor. If you really love strong garlic taste these instant spuds are for you.;neutral
I love stevia drops but am not a huge fan of this English toffee.  Im not sure what the difference is between this one and the other flavors, but this one almost tastes like sugar alcohol.;neutral
the flavor was not as expected but still useful in cooking.  I bought this to use at my coffee bar but it does not have a smooth enough flavor;neutral
Some of the nuts tasted old. The rest were ok.;neutral
they get a little moosh, but the taste is fine!;neutral
Super thick, hence not easy to spread;neutral
Ok but I like the other one better.;neutral
"INGREDIENTS: Kiwi, sugar, citric acid, sulfur dioxide, Blue FCF, tartrazine

Tastes fine though. You'd probably pay a lot more for preservative-free.";neutral
Just didn't like the taste of these.  Tried all 4 didn't think they were very good.;neutral
disappointed that the bags weren't vacuumed sealed;neutral
For me, the variety pack had only one that I liked. I can not eat spicy foods, but my daughter and her family loved them;neutral
Good taste. The bottle should be bigger;neutral
"The last container I ordered was finer in texture and messy looking.  It does dissolve a little better.  This batch was paler in color and the taste isn't there.  At this point, ""cost exceeds value"".";neutral
Eh, ok if you're looking for variety, but a little weak. Didn't really taste almond or caramel.;neutral
not sure how this bag of candy is, but the paper was stuck to all the candy.;neutral
Ordered two boxes and both were slightly crushed.;neutral
Bought this to replace the more spendy Maldon Smoked Sea Salt in cookies I bake, but found it too smoky tasting. Will use it for meat dishes instead.;neutral
This being my first white chocolate I didn't realise it doesn't taste like chocolate . . . surprise, surprise!;neutral
honey centers not liquid. it would be ok if it were fresh but they were not. . . . .;neutral
"Excellent product; but, when I want to buy more is too difficult";neutral
Not particularly fresh tasting. The cheese flavor was somewhat odd and a little bitter.  Bought it for guests, but it's not good enough...I wouldn't buy again.;neutral
The product was as described, delivered expected. Berries are very bitter.;neutral
It arrived fresh, but I was expecting a lot more. It literally was just 1 bunch enough to make a Caprese salad once.;neutral
THIS WAS A INEXPENSIVE GIFT FOR A HARDCORE SNACK LOVER. I WISHED THE ITEMS WERE A LITTLE BIGGER BUT THE PERSON LOVED IT. IT LOOKS GREAT AND THE QUALITY IS GOOD, IT'S JUST THE LACK OF SIZE.;neutral
Not as hard as corn nuts but still has good toasted corn flavor. A bit expensive so I won't be ordering online anymore though.;neutral
Good taste but most of the cups exploded and put coffee grounds in cup.  May have got a bad batch from the seller;neutral
The taste sure takes some getting used to and I'm having a hard time drinking it.  It supposed to help with COPD which I have due to chonric bronchitis - never smoked.  Not sure what to make of it.;neutral
Love cookies but $7.00 dollars plus shipping for 16 cookies is too much for me. If u love oreos you will love these cookies.;neutral
Eh, between 2 and 3 stars.  I won't buy them again.  I like coconut and these cookies had plenty of it but they were just eh, nothing special.;neutral
Sort of tastes like vanilla, but fine othewise.;neutral
Heavy beef flavor and closer to a blood pudding consistency than cooked ground beef.  Maybe it is mostly that red filler stuff that has been ok'd by the USDA?  Good for emergency use though.;neutral
Surprisingly, this flavor has an odd taste. I usually love all Jell-O gelatin desserts, but this one is off in taste.;neutral
Good!  I may try yellow popcorn next.  First time with white.;neutral
This flour was ok but I don't think I will order flour from Amazon again. The expiration date was fine but it still seemed a little stale.;neutral
I didn't realize there was sugar in the Stevia until it came.  It tastes really good, but I didn't want the sugar.;neutral
Good not exceptional. Not much coffee flavor but lots of chocolate flavor very thin and watery and diluted taste. Bit stale too. Starbaux  quality but pricey.;neutral
yummy but not as spectacular as i expected;neutral
An okay product, but I changed to BETTER STEVIA on the basis of price.;neutral
My kids love this.  It's so easy and quick using the Keurig.;neutral
Kind of acidic. Not at all what you get in Italy.;neutral
got the variety pack. they were okay. i really liked the peanut butter one, but i probably wouldn't buy it again.;neutral
Like the noodles, but didn't care for the rice.;neutral
It's ok. It reminds me of strawberry pop tarts, which I hate.  I'm glad there's only 4 box, I kept only two and gave it away to co-workers.  I'm not buying this again for sure.;neutral
Not bad for boiled oysters.  If you want great tasting oysters buy fresh at a sea food store.  Coastal Foods in MN sells great oysters fresh.;neutral
But it's nice for decaf late night tea. A little bitter taste, but if you drink it with a slice of lemon in the cup, it's okay.;neutral
It was alright. The premade cans taste better than this powder.;neutral
Purchased before and it was pretty good. This time they have changed the pod which has to thick of plastic and the coffee was not very good. Will not purchase again.;neutral
not as lush as it shows in picture, leaves were soggy , and sure 3 little twigs died. not happy with the plant I got.;neutral
This coffee was OK in already-ground form, but tasted stale compared to fresh-ground coffee. I got lazy and paid for it in mediocre coffee!  Next time I'll get this in whole bean form.;neutral
Chocolate was starting to turn, how it does when it's getting old.;neutral
This product is OK. Too graining for me. Needs bigger pieces that you can bite into. Kind of average. Not worth the price.;neutral
Good coffee for the price.  Not as tasty as some more expensive brands but I would buy this again.;neutral
This tea tastes like a piece of Big Red chewing gum.  It's not bad, but it does not taste like Chai.  Tazo is far superior in taste.;neutral
"Not my favorite green tea; kind of ordinary.";neutral
too many unopened nuts and not as tasty as other purchases  also seemed to be less fresh;neutral
The soup is OK. When you look at the store shelf prices, there are MANY better choices for that much money, though. Overpriced.;neutral
These bars are ok but do lack some in taste.  They are not as tasty as the original Kind bar with dark chocolate.;neutral
Not much bacon flavor, very strong salt taste. It comes it a good sized resealable bag.;neutral
These are pretty good, for gluten free... not as good or even close as regular pop tarts. Still, they're a nice treat. I wish they'd make the chocolate frosted ones.;neutral
I never ate this before. Don't know how it is supposed to taste. I don't care for it. The end.;neutral
This Coffee was OK, but I decided to seek out a Reusable Coffee Pod to fill with My Favorite Coffee.;neutral
The taste of Community Coffee doesn't come through as strong as I would like.;neutral
I love these pickles, but I ordered the Sour Sis but received the Hot Mama's...it appears this happens often so I'm hesitant to purchase again.;neutral
This is a good solid everyday Earl Grey. It has a nice classic British tea flavor.;neutral
It is ok. It doesn't have a strong taste no matter how much I use. I like a mild roast but this is too mild for me.;neutral
I love adding it to other beverages. Alone I like it better when I added several drops of stevia to it. However, my sister LOVES it as is!;neutral
it is too hard to chew, the color is very dark, my mom hates it;neutral
Rather strong flavor.  Felt like it made my pancake slimy... Not sure if I would order again.;neutral
Just  good ...  I tryed another brand I bought in Whole foods, that one was much better, less sweet, more lingonberry like;neutral
This product, when reconstituted with water, doesn't taste much like butter and the consistency is pretty bad. It will be used for recipes and added as a dry powder to vegetables, etc. it works fairly well.;neutral
Tastes more like peel than flesh. Love the lemon kind though.;neutral
I was digging the flavor, but other than that it's a good product!;neutral
Did not like this at all. I prefer making my own.;neutral
great product, a bit expensive, but good things come at a cost-hence the 3 star,  5 stars for taste.;neutral
Too sweet for my tastes.  I tried it a couple time but went back to just Morton Tender Quick for bacon.;neutral
"I love a bolder roast but my husband likes a smoother cup. This was on the weak side for me...so I probably
won't be buying this one again. He said it was just ""OK""...";neutral
Dried cranberries. Not very sweet or flavorful, but fresher than the name brand.;neutral
Was not impressed with this water. Went back to my normal brand.;neutral
This stuff isn't for everyone but I happen to love the taste.;neutral
This tea is okay...but, was so much better with a nice scoop of spicy rooibos:) I love my spicy red (non caffeine) red rooibos! Adds a hint of just enough of the spice I want, to ANY tea!;neutral
tasted flat, and did not ship well, about 1/2 crumbs when I got it;neutral
It taste very bitter . And tea bags look very stale;neutral
Was looking for a good Muscovado and figured I'd try this. I felt like there were a ton of solid lumps which really ruined the consistency of my baking. Probably won't buy this again, but it was okay.;neutral
its changed, taste's different and shorter;neutral
I bought it once. I used it for espresso and it left me kind of cold. Just nothing about it made me want to drink it again. Seemed a bit weak and insipid to me.;neutral
Didn't know the size. It makes only a couple ounces of gravy. I/We eat gravy... On potatoes, on biscuits, on bread... Maybe that's why it's French... tiny little bits of gravy.;neutral
Need bananas. Need to keep central America employed. But I never eat more than 3 of these. 2 WASTED, nearly ever time I buty this. Food waste because they are not available by 3's.;neutral
I didn't know what to expect. Not my favorite taste or texture which is heavy and grassy. They are very filling.;neutral
My son likes the taste but not as well as other Annie's snacks.  Like that it is organic.  Would like smaller packages for lunches.;neutral
Given out to co-workers in candy dish. No negative responses.;neutral
"I would not call them ""healthy"", but they are good for hiking and other forms of travel when you cannot find a place to stop and eat.";neutral
several rancid/black/shrunken pieces to discard;neutral
Too much of a raisin taste for me but others might like it;neutral
do not like this as well as the Green Apple by Capella.  Theirs is spot on apple....this is very muddled and has much less flavor;neutral
"the flavors were fine... .if you enjoy ""light"" tasting ligh roast coffees...and first thing in the morning it's not my ""cup of coffee"" I enjoythese more in the evenings....or mid day";neutral
This rice flour is not nearly as sticky as I thought it would be.;neutral
tried these as an alternative to the chocolate that we easily find in our local sams club.  we prefer skim milk so probably won't buy again, but love the price and the fact it is organic;neutral
It is OK but strange. Not something I would order again;neutral
I am very picky about coffee.  I like a rich full bodied cup of coffee with a smooth finish.  This was just OK.;neutral
Disappointed in double stuf Oreo because it was more like single stuf;neutral
It's not as good as the apple but it is ok.  Will be adding it to cereal and then it tastes good.;neutral
Good coffee...Mild but strong enough;neutral
works better if sweetened up with some simple sugar syrup;neutral
I had tried the dark roast in this brand. It was too strong, so I ordered the light roast. It is okay, but not great.;neutral
The flavor is mostly fine, a bit bitter, I think my batch was over ground, it's far too fine.;neutral
I thought it was a little weak for my taste. It's nice that it has the cream and sugar in it already,;neutral
Not as good as I expected. Won't by again.;neutral
Taste delicious.....all four berries. Not worth the price.;neutral
they were ok but taste like sour fruit  slices and ones i get from bjs are sweeter  and cheaper at 5.69 for 48 oz bulk not wrapped which i like better since im the only one eating them;neutral
It's okay, but it didn't work for me.;neutral
It was fun to do, but DO NOT expect it to taste good.  But the kids enjoyed it and it looked super cute.;neutral
This tea is okay...this might just be me, but I'm not a huge fan of the flavor. It doesn't taste much like mango. The bag it comes in is also not the most convenient for getting the tea out.;neutral
Product is very good, shipping can be expensive.;neutral
Like Starbucks ground coffee better;neutral
Like the toasty cheese and peanut butter better.;neutral
Better years ago when the taste was better, presentation was improved, and they were packed with less sinister ingredients, none of which got stuck in your esophagus. Happy I got 'em at the WH Deals rate.;neutral
Very thick. Thicker than I expected. Have to really squeeze the heck out of the bottle to get out. More of a moca chocolate flavor...not a milk chocolate flavor.;neutral
This coffee us just okay. Nothing special. Definitely not strong enough for me.;neutral
This is okay, both in texture and in taste, but it's not as good or anywhere near as soft as the trader joe's one that I was trying to replace.  The search continues! =);neutral
I didn't feel any difference drinking this coffee versus drinking regular coffee. This coffee has a very earthy taste.;neutral
Not as good as a few years ago! Be careful! Only buy small amount. This can will outlast you,  your children and grand children.;neutral
Not quite Swiss Miss quality ... but that is why there are so many brands ... this one does not make it;neutral
Other brands I've tried are much more flavorful and better textured.  This seems a bit bland and waxy.;neutral
Did not really care for these. I gave them away.;neutral
Not sweet enough for me, kind of bland, mostly just cinnamon taste;neutral
i didn't care for them this way, i stick to the box from the store, my daughter liked it though;neutral
I little sweet, but it's ok. I'll use it, but likely not purchase again.;neutral
Gritty and hard to dissolve but ingredients excellent for good start on healthy vegan day. Lots of protein, no worries;neutral
Smelled great, packaging was open and leaking.;neutral
Great chewy texture, very little flavor beyond the seeds that cover each piece.;neutral
Im not sure how to describe it other than bitter with a taste of dirt. I love flavored coffees. Ill pass this on to friend who isn't picky. Live & learn.;neutral
I only liked the bottom tea. I should have just bought it in the regular can size. It is wonderful! You may like the other flavors but they weren't for me.;neutral
I thought I would try something different and it is.  It is not a bad tasting coffee but...I would not order it again.;neutral
They are olives in little individual packets. Good olives - but nothing special. I'll  stick to the olive bar at my local grocery store and reduce my waste output.;neutral
It's fine. Mild in flavor. Not the greatest deal I can get it for the same price at trader joes;neutral
I didn't find this to be a delicious as other teas in this product line.;neutral
Bought for mom - After prying it out of her, she said she liked Harry & David's baskets better.;neutral
Tasty, but gritty. Too gritty for me I'm afraid.;neutral
Didn't liked the taste.  Better off making your own or use it as baking ingredient.;neutral
i tried to use these pills to drink coffee without sugar but they did nothing. then i tried them with some other foods but nothing. they do work with lemons, limes and grapefruits though;neutral
This product is good conceptually, but it fails on execution.  The bites are far too sweet and gelatinous in texture to be really delicious.;neutral
Its Honey-  it taste just like honey, so if  you like the taste of honey, buy this honey.;neutral
"I was greatly impressed with the snickers and Twix I love it
But others, there is high sugars only";neutral
My kids love it but I thought it had more protein. 2g of protein per bar when the regular sized cliff bar is 10g of protein. Either way it is a great on-the-go snack and very nutritious;neutral
Its good, and the flavor is good, just WISH IT DIDNT HAVE PRESERVATIVES.;neutral
A good tea.  Nice to have a different choice every once in a while and very robust in flavor.  GREAT!!;neutral
We tried it first time - nothing special! It is not so economical food.;neutral
They were okay, but I may not buy them again.;neutral
Can was dented. Haven't used it yet but I presume the contents are as expected.;neutral
Doesn't seem to give me as much energy as the carbonated celcius.  I bought these to take on vacation and they are just OK.;neutral
Not what I expected. Kind of like chocolate covered raisins.;neutral
Way too bitter... I was not expecting it to be so harsh. I will use it in baking but not in cold preparations. I have used raw powders before and they have not been so acidic and sharp.;neutral
"The beans are pretty spot-on to the description.  The spinner doesn't work for beans however ; )";neutral
Not overly crazy, but it's all a matter of personal taste.  Just felt more processed that a good bbq taste.;neutral
I am having a tough time getting use to the bland taste, but that's not this products fault that is because I am use to way to much sugar!!!!!  But I am sure this will be great once I am use to it!  :);neutral
"Crisp could/should be replaced by ""hard.""  I was expecting a taste of rye, I was disappointed";neutral
Nicely packaged, but product was not as expected.  Not nearly as big ... not a big variety. Was disappointed for the price!;neutral
Have lots of artificial food coloring. Probably will never buy again;neutral
It's okay (three stars) really says it all for this brew. You could do worse. Decaffeinated is not Chock Full O'Nuts strength.;neutral
I actually like this juice but would prefer to have more papaya and no pear juice. Grape or apple blended may be a better choice.;neutral
its ok. smells better then taste. but its to each individuals tast;neutral
These are okay but not very appetizing looking.  If you can get past that - give it a try.  I would not purchase again.;neutral
"I did not care for this product.  I like butter;  however, I do not like the taste of this product..  The flavor is too rich.  I cannot blame this on the product....it just does not agree with me.";neutral
I have enjoyed better locally. Packaged and delivered okay but the taste not up to my liking.;neutral
"They were almost past their ""use by"" date had to give most of them away!!!!";neutral
"Quite a few pods, at least 6, were faulty in that the coffee powder somehow escaped the internal filter
and ran into the cup, ruining the whole drink.";neutral
Good product but stale on chips. Shelf life may have been exceeded;neutral
It's okay. Sent two boxes to my grandaughter in college. She said that she likes it.;neutral
The taste is great, but I had to use much more than I woulld have liked to get sugary sweetness.;neutral
Great for a small something to eat.;neutral
Not impressed - hardly any flavor, just very sweet. I was really looking forward to tasting toasted marshmallow, but this just doesn't do it.;neutral
This was okay, I had picked this up for a recipe that called for it;neutral
My Keurig had a problem with the cup today.  A real K-Cup worked fine on the next try.  Taste of coffee is excellent.;neutral
Just one more super food that didn't necessarily make me feel super.;neutral
OK, for when you are in a hurry or just lazy.  No off flavors and has caffeine, works as advertised.;neutral
not as tasty as I was hoping for but still good.;neutral
Small, less flavorful cashews, bad enough to drive me back to peanuts.;neutral
The chocolates in my box were not misshapen by the heat, but there was fat bloom on them (white streaks) which suggests they got warm sometime, but not so warm they melted. Not as smooth as they should be.;neutral
"Didn't like it; gave it away. Friend loves in smoothies.";neutral
They're ok. Fruity and maybe a little minty. Keeps hunger at bay while out and about.;neutral
Pretty good, but not as good as I remember from when I was a kid. It's just as fast to make up a small box of jello instant pudding and in my opinion the jello tastes better.;neutral
Didn't like the pale color or price.;neutral
"Price is good, taste is fine.  However...when mixing I always end up with small white clumps of gelatin
no matter how I've tried.  I have a mixing problem with the Now Brand so I've switched to Zint.";neutral
Is a little too chocolaty for our taste.  We will use up and not purchase again.;neutral
Ok, not really what I am looking for...want a chewy licorice toffee but this is not it.  Good stuff, just now my stuff!;neutral
Its sweet and granular like sugar and has no fructose.  However it DOES have sugar alcohols which are not recommended for my high fat, low carb diet.  So... weaning off.;neutral
Not too bad but not much taste of Kona.;neutral
Does Not appear the name outside the package if organic or not;neutral
These pineapple chunks are absolutely delicious.  However, when I ordered them, I do not believe that it said they contained sugar.  I thought they were simply dried pineapple chunks.  That was disappointing.;neutral
I love MiO, but this flavor bummed me out a bit... WAY too acidic for me.... totally overtook the actual flavor.;neutral
These taste a little sweet but the amount you get isn't a lot.;neutral
I'm not a coffee connoisseur but I think it tastes okay.;neutral
Did not like the lack of variety in the sample pack. 4 community coffee and 2 are dark roast.;neutral
The flaxseed is very tasty and seems quite fresh.  However, I use flaxseed for smoothies so wanted it finely ground and this is not.;neutral
I like that this pancake mix is organic and healthy, but it is a little gritty and bitter at times. All though not organic I prefer coach's oats multi grain pancake mix;neutral
The blue bagged Lavazza is far better.;neutral
Taste decent, not as a good as the $1 frozen Banquet pot pies though.  I add hot sauce and black pepper to it, to make it taste more flavorful.;neutral
Not as chewy as the boba shops and they can get a bit mushy.;neutral
I've come to the conclusion that seeking a bargain in cashews is a zero sum game.  Best deal is to just go to Target and get the giant cashews that are great.;neutral
"Yikes!  Watch the salt content in this stuff.  880 mgs in a Tbsp.
Okay for the occasional Miso soup & adding a little to recipes.";neutral
It was ok, had better. Did not think very tasting but that is a personal preference.;neutral
Ok but too surgary and grainy for my taste.  If you want a sugar high....this will do it.;neutral
A very good product except for the high salt content. But then, I would prefer bread without any salt.;neutral
The cake mix had a very artificial smell as it was baking and was too lightweight for my taste once baked. I put homemade buttercream icing on it and we ate it, anyway.;neutral
more convenient than slicing natural ginger. Works well and fast;neutral
Not sure why people are saying they are painful, these definitely are not. Wish they would last longer, a few chews on the mints and they are gone. Quick refreshing mint flavor, in a small chew type mint.;neutral
I've had excellent powdered milk, but not in America. I had high hopes for this.;neutral
little too sweet and a little aftertaste to me;neutral
Tastes like the stuff in the cafes, in fact, I think it is the same brand my local coffee shop uses. I wish it wasn't so sweet though. It also has a lot of calories per serving.;neutral
"OK for quick snack but prefer healthier
Choices for main meal@ breakfast.
I carry them in purse incase I miss a
Meal.";neutral
Not really a good deal here on Amazon. I find it local at a better price. The products itself is fine but I actually prefer Bob's Red Mill brand for some reason.;neutral
good but you don't get a lot for the price.;neutral
Grainy in texture but does have a good taste.;neutral
I needed 28 full stars for napkin rings that I was making.  I found 28 unbroken ones in the bag, but I was getting really nervous!  I would say 90% were in pieces.;neutral
Very expensive for such a small box;neutral
I do not like this flavor as well the others I have tried of this brand.  It really has no taste of Blueberry.  Green Mountain Blueberry is much better.;neutral
Nothing particularly remarkable in the flavor, although my son liked it more than I.;neutral
These arrived fast and fresh, but the flavors are not tasty!;neutral
Not as good as I thought they would be.;neutral
"Real mixed review here.  I liked two out of six flavors very much, and one other hit me as ""okay.""  However, there were three I really didn't like at all.  Personal preference, perhaps.";neutral
Pretty good chocolate and OK flavor. Variable quality and sizes in the package.;neutral
Xylitol gum.  People think it is good for their teeth.  Maybe it is.  It tastes pretty good, not great.  Does not cause as much pain in the cavities as sugar gum, but still some pain.;neutral
Not as good as expected- tend to be sour;neutral
didn't really have much of a squid flavor. it was spicy and tasted like a potato chip. Only the after taste had a squid/fishy flavor but very faint.;neutral
"I would like to return this, but Amazon does not allow it.
This flavor is muddy and jut plain unpleasant. My wife thinks so too.
Sorry, other flavors like apple strawberry are fine.";neutral
"It Was Quite Thin And Watery, Not Very Chocolatey,
The Flavor Was OK, But It Needs To Be Thicker And Richer.";neutral
This was good but I have other seasonings that I like better.;neutral
"These pickles are crispy, but are not at all spicy ""  or dilly.  They are slightly sweet, very slightly tangy,and, to me, not what I expect a pickle to be.  Blah is the word on these pickles.";neutral
Tastes better slightly sweetened (I used Stevia).;neutral
"They are delicious, yes, but I'm confused how a relatively small bar packing this much fat can be called ""healthy.""  And they sure don't tell you about it in their description!";neutral
NOT FOR ME. BUT I LIKE A LOT OF THEIR PRODUCTS.;neutral
Product okay.  I ground it in the spice grinder otherwise it was like eating brown paper;neutral
Too much sugar in the bars for diabetics;neutral
Purchased this when the regular bags were not available. I prefer the yellow popcorn in the bags. Go green, not for me.;neutral
Will work on your turkey or chicken.;neutral
This mayo is fabulous but way too expensive.  Shop around.;neutral
These Taste great, but they are more of a bite size than a full bar size. Fyi I have smaller hands (for the pictures reference size);neutral
It is powered milk. I make with smoothies. Always have milk on hand.;neutral
it does not saute as well as it should.  If you like hot,hot,hot, you will love it.;neutral
I was really excited to try the nacho cheese flavor but there was SO much nacho cheese powder stuck to each chip that it was ridiculous and messy! Won't buy that flavor again.;neutral
Make sure that you read the amount that is included not just look at the picture.  In the picture it shows 7 flavors and you only get 6 of them.;neutral
I love my Keurig brewer but I did not care for this kind of tea..I'm sure its okay but it just wasn't the taste of tea I am used to.;neutral
Was happy to see tea in K-Cups.  However, tea was weak and rather sweet in flavor.  Perhaps they could make other stronger flavors.;neutral
Didn't really like the small size of the kernels.  I wouldn't buy these again.  Taste is OK, though.;neutral
It does not have the aroma the regular Basmati rice has.  The best way to cook is to make it flavorful Indian rice instead of just cook it plain.;neutral
You can get Godiva 62% easier and cheaper.  I bought this so I would have enough money for free shipping.  No big deal.;neutral
Not a very strong caramel flavor. Basically just sweet orange water. Not overly pleased with this. Could be improved...;neutral
Not as good as had from other sellers,;neutral
The flavor is good but if you are looking for super sour look elsewhere. If you want lemony goodness, this serves the purpose. I wouldn't even compare the sourness of these to warheads.;neutral
They were good, but were not amazingly memorable.;neutral
"These take 18 - 28 minutes to cook, and they're still chewy. I guess ""Homemade Style"" means uncooked raw dough! Sixty four Oz is a lot for one guy!!!";neutral
Love the taste but not the ingredients. Gives me indigestion problems.;neutral
Syrup is hard to find. Flavor is not very good. Cost of syrup is higher than expected. cost of extra bottles high.;neutral
This is good tasting licorice but am partial to the smooth.;neutral
It tastes ok, but it feels a bit like cardboard in your mouth. It is actually too crunchy. I chew in fear. My 10 year old says she gets too tired eating it, makes her jaws hurt when she's done.;neutral
These did not taste like the ones from Olive Garden lol. Kind of stale ? Definitely not fresh. :( Some were melted but it was delivered in FL.;neutral
I receive product on time it was I expected;neutral
Good item and shipped to my APO with no problem.;neutral
package is showing signs of leakage from contents when received from shipment.  Over all the inside package of the spray paint is peeling.;neutral
I did not care for the taste or texture of these crackers - However, I do love the original crackers and the vanilla & chocolate wafer cookies.;neutral
LIKEDTHEM, BUT NOT THAT MUCH, THINK OF ANOTHER FAVOR HOW ABOUT ORANGE, GPAPE IS GREAT.;neutral
While the Miracle Noodles are usually quite good, these are a bit slimy and mushy...could just be the larger size of the noodle...perhaps cut into smaller pieces and try to dry a bit...;neutral
I won't say it isn't good for you. but I didn't like the taste. It just clashed somehow. but it was nice to know that I was pouring nutricious down the hatch.;neutral
Capsules were a hair too small so I have to hold them in place before closing the handle otherwise they fall through most of the time.;neutral
Great flavor but I didn't realize it was a powder and not a fine grind.;neutral
"waaaay sweeter than the black ones (from another company)
sugar-frosted.
Will not buy further for that reason";neutral
After all the hype, this coffee let me down a little.  It's not bad, but it doesn't have a lot of flavor.  No sour aftertaste or bitterness, but kind of flat tasting.  I prefer Starbucks Sumatra to this one.;neutral
The spice has a strong clove smell and taste that differs from the type of Garam Masala spice I've had previously.  Some may like it but I didn't.;neutral
"way over priced for sure.....doesn""t look appetizing at all....the picture shown in ad is NOT what it looks like at all !!! Buyer Beware";neutral
The packaging is absolutely adorable. I didn't really like the taste of the candies, as they were quite sugary.;neutral
Decent taste, but a bit hard to get all of the product out of the container easily. Also, it helps for it to be cold. Not sure about prices as I have seen these cheaper locally.;neutral
This is okay. A little bit disappointing but a still good option for those of us that eat sugar free.;neutral
Tried these, like the salt, but overall experience (chocolate was not dark/intense and nuts were overdone as in too many) was meh.. Will not be buying these again.;neutral
This was a good flavor, but everyone that tried it felt like it would be better for breakfast. I wouldn't buy it again, except for breakfast maybe.;neutral
This is a good product but the consistency is only average the flavor fades too quickly for my taste!  But it is what it is right?;neutral
Bought this for my daughter-in-law, she never used potato flour before, it took a little getting use too but she said she really likes it.;neutral
Quite a few of them survived shipping intact.;neutral
The two I tryed so far were ok. The pancakes were very flat, but the flavor was ok. These mixes are meant for multi use like a bisquick sort of  thing.;neutral
If you need just a touch of cheese these packs are very quick with little mess.  I wish the cheese had a slightly better feel to it - it seems a bit waxy ands a bit of a processed taste!;neutral
- only had the rice so far.  Didn't like the texture.;neutral
More bitter to me than what I had been using.;neutral
In love that I can get these in bulk but wish they would arrive without all the dents.;neutral
"One of the three bottles had a leak, lost some of the Coconut oil.
Cecil";neutral
this stuff was meh, I mean it was not terrible but I didn't like the flavor much;neutral
I made the mistake of buying an evergreen Bonsai for in the house and it died within a few months.  If you are looking for an indoor Bonsai then don't get any of the evergreens.;neutral
not impressed...not re-ordering...there is nothing outstanding...just run of the mill coffee;neutral
I used this to make pancakes. It was just OK to me. I haven't tried using it for anything else.;neutral
"Tastes nice but doesn't ""feel"" as potent as the Synergy brand... for medicinal purposes I prefer the other.";neutral
Not very tasty. Fine grit...probably just me.;neutral
It's ok I used it various applications and was not wowed by it.;neutral
Good chocolates, but it is a lot of box but not full with chocolates.;neutral
This kind of cinnamon is supposed to be much healthier, but true cinnamon lovers will stall want to use the regular kind most of the time. It's a huge box too, enough to last several households a lifetime.;neutral
These are the crunchiest peanuts I've ever had. Not sure that's good or bad as Planters are/were my standard brand. One assumes they are MEANT to be more crunchy vs. being stale...;neutral
These are okay. Not something I'd want to drink every day.  A bit of an artificial taste.  Nothing great, but they're drinkable.;neutral
I bought this and its okay - nothing wrong with it.  I now mix my own chickory and coffe blend.;neutral
Could be better, it doesn't really have a good taste to me and the kids don't like it either.  I plan to try the Swissmiss brand and hopefully it'll be better.;neutral
Good but I've had better..little pricey for so so beans.;neutral
I bought this coffee because of all the five star reviews. Unfortunately, I am disappointed by its flavor, which seems pedestrian. I will not buy this coffee again.;neutral
Good price and will buy again when I run low;neutral
a little bitter, definitely bold and full bodied. Would likely buy again if they go on sale, otherwise I'll stick with Jet Fuel;neutral
it is what it is.. a tootsie pop flavored like a candy cane..;neutral
The K Cup system is great for quick coffee with no mess, but the taste is ok at best.;neutral
"this was not as pictured, which looks different than the others.
when it came it was just 1 more exactly like the other chewy
caramels, except more than double the price!";neutral
Well, they are a bit stale tasting and they are only a month away from the best buy date, I knew what I was getting into when I bought them! Because they were on close out;neutral
I've had better organic sesame oil. The good oil doesn't have the greasy taste to it. This one tastes a little off for me.;neutral
It has a nice flavor.  But it is very weak so 1 K-cup only brews 4-5 oz flavorful.;neutral
raisins were too hard  we will not buy this again;neutral
Good flavor but the oil is way over the top. A few more clams, and a little less oil would be nice. However, beware, Product is from China.;neutral
"This is a fair price for the product. I've seen this advertised for less elsewhere,
but it is the real deal.";neutral
this coffee is alright, not terrible, not wonderful.  For my taste...their  Ethiopa Sidama version is stupendous!!  that one is way superior to the Duane street one,  for me at least;neutral
It taste okay. It would work for a college party. Has Red 40;neutral
This is a personal taste thing - the rice by itself is yum, however when I try to mix it with my beans it tatstes soapy to me...so thats a bit of a turn off.;neutral
highly priced for something I could have grounded myself.;neutral
A lot of same choices, the better teas you get 1.;neutral
I found out that Santa Cruz does not want to label foods that have GMO's in them. They put money in campains that were anti-labeling.;neutral
This will make SOUP or can be used to add to a plain chili or soup or rsmen to dress it up, but don't expect it to be chili. More of a chili corn chiwder, except it is soup, not chowder.;neutral
Bought for my daughters who are ages 2 and 1, item was a little too hard for them to chew. It also has 21 grams of sugar, which is really high.;neutral
"Tastes good, a bit salty and more than I'd usually pay.

I tried to get a clear explanation of what's in the Himalayan salt, but only got an invite from the seller to write this review.

I await my answer.";neutral
I am sure the product is high quality;neutral
They tasted almost exactly like Airhead Ropes, but blander and more gelatinous. A strange experience I would not want to repeat. Also, the box is made of balsa wood, which is very odd?;neutral
All with complicated yet similar taste;neutral
This box not as strong as prior box;neutral
Good product, but very expensive. And shipping charges are very high;neutral
Tastes just like grounded peanuts. Taste the way it's suppose to.;neutral
Effect cheese sauce for taco chip snack;neutral
It tastes fine, but the flavor does not last. The consistency is better than most gums though. Not too bad for the price.;neutral
I have had better Sumatran coffee from this company. The other one was decaf but it had a mild body and chocolate under tones.;neutral
Probably won't order it again. Was ok for a quick lunch, but really seemed under seasoned and rather blah--was handy to carry.;neutral
"$10 for a box of crackers was a bit much but I was curious so I ordered.
It wasn't worth $10 and definitely won't order again.";neutral
Not really sweet enough unless you use waaay more than they suggest.  I did not notice any aftertaste.;neutral
They were good but some of them were not fresh.;neutral
My brother liked this stuff. Or, so he said.  He hasn't served himself any more since the first one.  I didn't like it.  It has a funny flavor and is mostly water.;neutral
Just OK, did not notice any significant increase in flavor using these versus grounded black pepper.;neutral
Fruit flavors are muted, rather than bright and strong - it's ok;neutral
A little too many figs. But made a nice gift;neutral
the spinach pizza is more to my liking.;neutral
Kernals may be tender, but are tiny;neutral
While this coffee is OK, it tends to get a bit of a burnt taste to it. Was not very impressed;neutral
A little on the pasty side but with good flavor.;neutral
these are okay...nothing great, just ok;neutral
Great product but boxes arrived smashed and dented, not open though.;neutral
not as good and chewy as bakery brownies but not bad for a packaged brownie. Just the right size for and afternoon snack.;neutral
Rather cheap tasty and extremely salty. Good for a garnish, not much else.;neutral
Read carefully.  I thought I was ordering gluten free and it somehow switched to regular.  Everyone is getting a bag of oatmeal for Christmas.;neutral
Could use more flavor but size is convenient and no sodium nitrite is a plus.;neutral
The pizza flavour are better. Found them a bit dull tasting even though you would expect a lot from a gingery product;neutral
Prefer other brands. But served the purpose.;neutral
Great product but they were out of date and stale;neutral
Kind of stale and cardboardy.  If you want good Stroopwafels go with Daelmans, they are the best!;neutral
"Too thick to ""pour"". Squeezing produced blobs that don't really spread out after heating in the microwave. Good flavor, though.";neutral
I'm sure it's an individual taste matter, but I didn't like the taste of this hazelnut vanilla combination at all.;neutral
A quality product, very great taste, but a bit high on the sugar content, (24 grams in 8 ounces)) A lower sugar content & Carb. content would be more healthful. (24 gram in 8 ounces );neutral
The chocolate is awesome... the salted caramel does not taste like salted caramel at all.;neutral
I really do not like the flavor of this coffee.  I wonder where the coffee taste is because it is missing.;neutral
Ok taste...nothing spectacular about these bars.;neutral
It's more sweet than salty, has a fishy smell and a jerky texture. I liked it but would prefered a saltier smokey taste.;neutral
It was OK not as good as I thought it would be.;neutral
Too salty to me, and it is hard to chew. But totally it's ok;neutral
think it's the best available but we use more salsa these days;neutral
These taste great! However, I am trying to move away from high-fructose corn syrup. So I will not buy again for that reason. If you don't care about that, these are a 5-star product!;neutral
I now personally stay away from the variety pack because there are a few in the mix that are questionable, but for the most part they are pretty good;neutral
"Thought they had a strong ""canned"" flavor.";neutral
They have a bitter taste that takes awhile to become accustomed to....kind of like getting used to artificial sugar in soda. Too strong of flavor for my liking.;neutral
Love the concept but 2 month sell by date.;neutral
Seems to be a high quality product, however the packaging is sub par. The seal on the container leaked and approx 10-15% of the powder got sprinkled around in the package.;neutral
Melts well, but doesn't taste like chocolate.;neutral
It's a good product. I just have a hard time with any caffeine. This states it has as much caffeine as a cup of green tea. I get too jittery.;neutral
I'd give this a much better review if it wasn't so expensive to buy!  I use it instead of bread crumbs on my fish and it provides a nice crust.;neutral
No flavor whatsoever, great if you want a bean base to add other things into.;neutral
Generally I love Green Mountain flavored coffees. This one is lack luster.  Leaves a bitter aftertaste. Others may enjoy it, but I will not purchase again.;neutral
They were so small!  Quality was good, just very hard to handle and it took so many.;neutral
Arrived in crumbs. Maybe not the best thing to have sent by delivery. Disappointed as this flavor is hard to find sometimes.;neutral
If you like coconut then this is the product for you...just too strong for my taste;neutral
I was really expecting this to taste different from regular Morton Table Salt.  It does not.  It just tastes like salt.  I won't be buying it again.;neutral
I love the English Toffee coffee.  Having it in single serving packets makes it easy too.;neutral
TOO SWEET-it needs more of the savory taste. The texture was wonderful, however-felt like I was eating crisp bacon. :);neutral
So-so not bad for price.  Makes nice gift;neutral
"I didn't really care for the flavor of these beef sticks.  They contain the spice Coriander, which I don't care for.
It's a healthy snack, just not to my liking.";neutral
Meh. It's green tea in a can. There are a lot of them, and it tastes OK. Nothing phenomenal, nothing bad.;neutral
To me, the tea is not as strong as other's that I have had.  Would not order this prodiuct from Kirlkand again;neutral
I was hoping for the strawberry flavor of pockies.  Nope.  I'm not sure I would even agree there is a flavor, much less call the flavor strawberry.  I will stick with the caramel creams I adore.;neutral
"This is an ""ok"" energy drink.  The best thing about it is the price tag.

  The flavor is very sweet and syrupy.  I got the 24 pack once.
  I drank 'em.

I don't think I will get this flavor again though.";neutral
Good product but a bit pricey for the amount in the package.;neutral
Needs bigger size.  Not enough dill taste.  And not salty enough.;neutral
"Tried this blend as a change from routine, but did not find it as enjoyable as I had hoped, still, it was good, just not great.
Pat";neutral
Love the brand but this tea has too much vanilla in it for my tastes.  Only Harney tea I have not liked.;neutral
Flavor seems rather sweet and also somewhat pricey at $10/quart. It's a snow cone flavor that works for me.;neutral
"I know today is ""less salt"" but pretzels need salt and these could use more. Peanut Butter was some what dry. I have had better. Probably paid more also. You get what you pay for.";neutral
I have had better. Not enough flavor. Probably won't buy again. As with all Pringles, they were broken up because of too much space to move around & bounce up and down in shipping.;neutral
It didn't work as I was hoping for me, but it may work for someone else. The taste wasn't bad after I added a little sugar;neutral
This is not what I would expect for British tea.  Rather weak.  Stash won our taste test.;neutral
I didn't care for them, but my housemate liked them (and the dogs). I just thought they had an odd taste that didn't appeal to me. They seemed very fresh. Just not what I was looking for.;neutral
I love salt which is a good thing. These are on the salty side. Cheap and tasty but not a 'caviar' experience. I love it with cucumbers instead of bread as a no-carb alternative to other salty snacks.;neutral
This product is very easy to over-do and then there is an unpleasant taste to whatever you put it in. I don't detect much chocolate flavor, either...and I know chocolate!;neutral
But it makes me crazy that we have to spend so much to get it here in the States.  There are cheaper prices out there, so I wouldn't buy these again.;neutral
Tasty, but I probably will never order this again.;neutral
I'm not sure what variety of peppers they used, but this, to me, is all heat and no flavor. I won't buy it again.;neutral
Can't handle the taste! And I'm pretty hardy when it comes to taste!;neutral
I love it!!!! the flavor its unique not to sweet.. perfect  I didn't give 5 starts because my cookies came brake in parts .;neutral
Too sweet for me, but it's OK if I combine it with xylitol, etc. I would not be able to use it by itself.;neutral
Doesn't stay fresh and tastes off (like it's gone bad) within about a week. I believe it needs to be refrigerated.;neutral
Seems like there is less lobster in it than years before. Disappointing.;neutral
A little too sweet for me. It's an alternative to peanut brittle. In texture.;neutral
Good Coffee, but too expensive here.;neutral
Bought these to bring to the office to share. They're O.K. but wouldn't buy them again. They smell good out of the box but the flavor, once brewed is minimal.;neutral
It works for a mayonnaise but flavor is not quite there.;neutral
OK--Will not buy again Hard,thick and crunchy. Weird taste;neutral
I'm not really crazy about the flavor of this one. It has an aftertaste and tends to remind me of alcohol.;neutral
eh i wasn't in love but ok....i feel like you need a ton and then a tad too much is too much;neutral
Its like eating a brick made of diamonds.;neutral
I thought I would get more tea in this container or the tea would be stronger but the quality wasn't very impressing for the price.;neutral
I've had better texture Cocoa Nibs, but these ones weren't bad at all... just not my favorite.;neutral
Not as good as Mt Dew's Kickstarts. Don't think I'll be purchasing them again.;neutral
Had a taste that neither myself or my wife could put a finger on.  Ok, but it fails to impress enough to make it a reorder.;neutral
The taco shells were good but they were all broken from shipping.;neutral
The tin is admittedly why I initially bought this one. The tea is heavy on the tannin and low on flavor, it's drinkable though. Be very careful brewing or you'll wind up with a very bitter swill.;neutral
Ordered these hoping for a great snack at only 90 calories.  They are just ok.  Don't think I would purchase again.  Very dry and not very tasty.;neutral
Not the tastiest protein powder in the world, and doesn't always mix well, even with a whisk, but it's okay.;neutral
"these are great to help you stay on a ""clean eating"" diet, even when you go out to dinner.  The price is high, but they are convenient";neutral
Well if you just need a little bit like I did, this is good. Wish the description showed how little is actually there instead of having to search the entire page to find it.;neutral
"This is the same product as always, EXCEPT - NOT CRISP, they are not stale, but lack that ""Snap"", that I remember.

I will go back to Canned ""Export Crackers"".";neutral
These were tooo sweet. I was looking for a more sour sweet taste, not just sweet. My grandson did like them though. Thats why I gave them 3 stars.;neutral
But I'd rather drink the REAL stuff.;neutral
Too  many flavored coffees in this mix;neutral
Was not our favorite flavor.  I expected the more prominent vanilla flavor.  But when you watching what you eat it's still a treat!  haha;neutral
See my reviews.  The semolina from Spain is far superior!;neutral
This has a LOT of sodium. People with High Blood Pressure beware.;neutral
I did not like them but the kids did;neutral
I purchased this product to color a red velvet cake. Unfortunately, it is not heat stable. The batter was a gorgeous color, but the baked cake turned out dark gold.;neutral
"I was surprised this didn't make as much pasta as the old blue Kraft mac & Cheese; I had to make a 2nd package to feed 2 of us.";neutral
not as good as I remember from Sam's - but it was also very hard - not soft like the others - glad my husband ate them!;neutral
My husband says it is stale and he makes the popcorn.;neutral
"It doesn't look gold at all.  It turned my oreos muddy.  But my students loved the ""golden"" oreos.";neutral
Not really very good for you, but tastes good and good for breakfast when you're in a hurry.;neutral
red is the best flavor, the other 2 taste weird (chemical). But I should tell you we ate them all.;neutral
"very much like a candy bar so I don't consider it a healthy snack.  Way too sweet but then that's what it claims!  ""Sweet and salty"".";neutral
This particular flavor tastes great. But it only lasts for a short time compared to the other flavors of this brand and gets hard in texture.;neutral
I expected a strong taste, like if it were concentrated, but its weak.  OK I guess if you need it for a certain type of diet.  Dont buy for taste only !!;neutral
Did not taste very good, and was dry. You need to get really creative with this mix to make something good.;neutral
Just standard pork skins though highly over priced;neutral
Flawless taste, but like others have mentioned about these particular treats, they come pretty brutalized when they arrive. Needs way better packaging to make them worth re-buying.;neutral
problem converting to 1 pound bread mixer. Better to back in oven.;neutral
I don't taste the vanilla in my smoothie and it adds a brown color vs the brown flecks you get from the bean.  I havnt baked with this yet. Will not reorder.;neutral
a little watery and very mild maple flavor.;neutral
Too difficult to squeeze the syrup out for me.;neutral
nice for afternoon snack not suitable for breakfast.;neutral
Lots of dented cans. Had to use most of them immediately after inspection. Didn't want to let them sit knowing they were damaged.;neutral
Great peanut butter, but extremely overpriced. Buy it locally and get the same quality faster, for less money.;neutral
These are good, but not as special as they're billed. I personally prefer the brand from my big box store, more for your money and somewhat better flavor.;neutral
The shipper was great, product well wrapped and received timely. The product itself, however, burns around the edges easily in the toaster. It seems to have been a 'bad batch'.;neutral
I use this when cooking. Most recently to flavor pizza crust.  Ih has a slight chemical taste that I really don't care for.;neutral
This is hit and miss. My husband was expecting mostly dark roast but that was only about half the pack. There are some really good coffees and some really bad ones.;neutral
Tastes pretty good with no noticeable sloe gin flavor. Pretty expensive.;neutral
I like the Celestial Seasonings sweet tea better.  This one is too sweet for my taste. I suppose that is difficult in a K Cup.;neutral
I like it...but my belly doesn't.  It gave me bad indigestion 3 out of 3 times.;neutral
Almost every nut has the end broken off!  They actually taste okay, but I wonder how they got that way...;neutral
I expected more peanut butter taste!  My wife like them me than I did!;neutral
If you like beet juice you will like this. Does not really taste like carrot juice at all. But it does have a natural sweet beet taste.;neutral
It's not bad, it's not great. I'm used to fresh saucisson and was hoping this would be close, it's not.;neutral
Doesn't pack a strong vanilla flavor, but I guess it serves as a sweetener.;neutral
Not great. I didn't enjoy the flavor of these.;neutral
I really haven't noticed any difference in my eye sight.  The tea has a good taste but won't re-order.;neutral
Arrived broken so I couldn't use for a pie.  It is really yummy if you can find it locally.;neutral
This product is OK, not great.  I purchased Hawaiian salt from Whole Foods and it is actually red (this stuff is pink) and has a much more intense flavor.  The price was much better at Whole Foods as well.;neutral
It taste good, but OMG extremely Salty. I'll have to try the low sodium. I'll keep you posted.;neutral
Always good. However, they melted in the box. Probably not the best choice for delivery in this hot weather.;neutral
I liked the shapes that are included, so was as expected. It was a bit smaller than the other 6 sprinkle mixes that I have purchased locally.;neutral
They're an okay snack, but probably better in pancakes or muffins!;neutral
It's ok, I like the porridge much much better.;neutral
A little too much rum flavor for me. Otherwise it's a decent cake.;neutral
"I purchased this as a healthy snack alternative to popcorn; however, my blood sugars still increased due to it being a carbohydrate.";neutral
"Bought this for quick sauce; but instant mixes are usually too high in sodium and/or fat.";neutral
If you are a health food junkie you will probably love.  These are a little too much like bird food.  They have one other flavor i want to try, but not for me.;neutral
Just an ok cup of coffee. Old tasting finish,not really flavorful;neutral
Not powder tho its ok. U can soak them in water it u want to soften them tho i just add some to my pudding. Works good for smoothie's. Not to strong. I do not like coconut tho this is ok.;neutral
Not one of my favorites. I thought the baked chips would be an add in at the end so they would be crisp, but they are not. It was okay, but didn't knock my socks off.;neutral
I expected chunky white meat, but, this is more like grated. I do not like the texture. May be good for some recipes, but, I like to top a salad.;neutral
"Not as good as I was expecting.  It's very chunky for what they describe as a ""creamy"" almond butter and it requires lots of mixing.  Taste is fine enough but the texture is way off base.";neutral
No really impressed.  Not spicy enough.;neutral
To me this is just a plain, old creamer.  I'd prefer something with a little spunk in it.;neutral
It is the first time that I buy this almond and they are like old and not tasted. They didn't even look as roasted.;neutral
not all natural and a bit too sweet. I preferred the original Hazer baba Turkish Delight;neutral
I didn't realize these were wheat free cookies and the corn and rice combination gave my son a stomach ache.  The have a kind of sandy texture.  So there weren't great for us.;neutral
"I did not really like the taste.
Doesn't taste like Sriracha.
Definitely not spicy enough.
I love cashews.
But was disappointed.";neutral
Not so tasty and way too sweet to be a health food.;neutral
It's too sweet--even with using their ratio.;neutral
mmmmm am somewhat otaku that why i wanted to try it jap sweet, it's normal cake but a little bit stiffer;neutral
Was OK. My Keurig had a hard time puncturing a hole in the cup. Only time I've ever had that problem on any K-Cup.;neutral
I don't know about this product...the jury's still out on this. I usually take about an average of 2 per week but I can't tell any effect any way what so ever. Maybe it's just my body makeup?;neutral
For my taste, the strips are way way too thin. Almost see-through. For the price, I would rather have much thicker strips and less of them (like they sell at Schwan's home delivery).;neutral
They came mostly broken.  I'd rather make the trip and go to Sam's Club and purchase them.  Those are rarely broken.;neutral
I like the idea of coconut oil and while the taste is good, they are a little on the salty side.;neutral
The coffee wasn't bitter or acidic.  I expected this coffee to have a bolder flavor, like other Brazilian coffee I've had.  I just ordered the Dark Roast version of this Santos coffee.;neutral
The ketchup is fine, the container is terrible.;neutral
"As with all low-sodium food, I found this to be quite bland; however, it is definitely a good product for those on a low-sodium diet.";neutral
they came early...thank you I love cheesy noodles;neutral
Makes a good base for gravy but really needs added flavoring, which isn't hard to do.;neutral
Good for those days when you are in a morning rush.  They fall apart easy and not nearly as many bits of chocolate as i remember or as pictured.;neutral
These are ok, low in calories, flavors are nice, they can taste artificially sweetness, but you just don't put as much in. All and all these are ok, WAY OVER PRICED, but ok.;neutral
The cookie tastes good, i like it. but the chocolate inside the cookies is not what i expected. It's not the juicy liquid-like chocolate as the box shows.;neutral
I'd read that ginger tea was great for sensitive stomachs, and while this is true, I find I'm not all that crazy about the taste.;neutral
Great taste. Not for drinking every time you want a cup of coffee.;neutral
It can be doubled to give more taste.;neutral
It's ok. Kinda bland, but good in a pinch when you don't feel like cooking. It'll fill you up.;neutral
These are OK but not as flavorful as I like.  Maybe it's just me.  My son tried them and liked them but they are not hazel nutty as I like.  I'll try again -- maybe the 1st cup was a dud.;neutral
After 24 cups I had enough.  The flavor started to taste fake after so much.  Even after taking a break and coming back to it I was over the flavor.;neutral
One of the pumps I received had a crack in it right out of the box. The other works great!;neutral
The kids as well as the adults really like the crackers.;neutral
Bitter, tasted almost on the verge of burnt.;neutral
The product was fine but there was a very large air bubble in it;neutral
Good price.  Didn't like it ...yikes!!! Save for gingerbread.  Not a good sweetener taste.;neutral
Eh...probably won't buy this flavor again.  It's okay but there are other flavors that are much better in my opinion.;neutral
This was okay espresso, but I didn't think it was good enough to justify the price.;neutral
Don't like the coconut ones. I think I'll stick with the chocolate and caramel ones.;neutral
Not as good as their bagged, flavored coffees. Hardly could taste any chocolate and slightly bitter.;neutral
Nothing too great about this product. It sweetens okay, but the vanilla doesn't exactly taste like true vanilla to me.;neutral
The coffee is a good cup of coffee but...this is NOT Blue Mountain coffee. I have had real Jamaican Blue Mountain and this isn't the same at all. I really wanted it to be the real thing.;neutral
Came very well packed. Even survived 10 degree blizzard in transit. It's been doing fine. But for whatever reason, after a month, it just fell apart and died... :(;neutral
Good but molds too quick in the fridge.;neutral
Not a big fan of processed can food but it's an ok meal if you don't have time once in a while;neutral
THIS IS PRETTY GOOD BUT DONT COMPARE TO THE GRAPE FLAVOR;neutral
No Brazil nuts.  Should have read the ingredients.;neutral
The taste is alright but is far more cinnamon-tasting for my liking. Reminded us of fireball instead of pumpkin.;neutral
"it's OK
it would get more stars if it has less sodium.
Mr. Cheese O's much better with 1/2 the sodium. similar pricing for the volume.";neutral
More chocolate would make them almost perfect.;neutral
Tastes pretty good, but too many carbs. Had to try it though.;neutral
The ginger oil is not organic, and why use brown rice syrup? Why not use less sugar or from another source that isn't a grain and has allergenic properties for many autoimmune sufferers?;neutral
As some of the other reviews stated, there were a few dented cans. Slightly dented so I'm not too worried about it. What I am worried about is the grey color. Why is the milk grey??;neutral
good coffee, but I prefer Hazelnut better. Eight O'Clock is my favorite brand for the price.;neutral
A spicy can of black beans that is not too flavorful but decent enough.;neutral
"tip clogs with syrup often, slight leakage at up/down pump; OK for price";neutral
Tastes great, but it's so acidic it hurts my mouth. :(;neutral
Really wish these were better tasting.  Not enough topping and many of them were burnt.. won't get them again.;neutral
This is my hubby's favorite coffee, but we are not happy with the packaging. For some reason 2-3 cups were broken open when it arrived and we got coffee grounds all over our garage, kitchen, etc.;neutral
Very strong, bitter coffee and not in a yummy espresso kind of way.  I don't hate it, but for the money, it's not as enjoyable as it should be.;neutral
This is another of the many Right Foods products.  Since McDougall sold the company to a third-party, quality has taken a hit.;neutral
Good flavor but does not seem to last more than 15 minutes.;neutral
Peach cherry almond flavor is better in my opinion;neutral
Not as thick as it used to be. What happened to Anticipation?  Still the best for dogs, burgers and fries though. Like the new shape to the bottle too.;neutral
To me, it tastes a little bit too sweet. It's a good product and I liked the fact coloring was not used like most of ginger.;neutral
"The spice did not appeal to my taste buds. Seems a little off; otherwise great product.";neutral
For me personally, it wasn't anything great. Not horrible, but not something I will buy again.;neutral
Not sure if I like this yet. Haven't had much chance to try it out.;neutral
I didn't care for the taste and the smell was awful;neutral
I expected them to have a richer chocolate taste, & suspect they were made to American (extra sugar) standards;neutral
Like the skippy natural much better and cheaper too.;neutral
I bought these due to the high reviews.  They had a waxy texture and were ok but not worth 5 stars.;neutral
A lot of sweet and not much coffee flavor;neutral
Good value for the money.....kinda buttery....but the nuts are broken and chipped. I also like the toffee....It reminds me of the nuts I used to sell as a YMCA Indian...;neutral
"We are a ""Jif Family.""  So, we gave the cinnamon flavored peanut butter a try.  We will not be buying more.  Just was not that tasty to us...all of us.  Sorry, but not worth the price.";neutral
With all those 5-star reviews, I was expecting far more. Makes a good cup. Not a great one, alas.;neutral
nice coloration and not so delicate that they fall apart when putting on cupcakes. very expensive for what you get tho.;neutral
i wasn't too thrilled about this. it requires refrigeration after opening and then it is hard to spread. i won't be buying this again.;neutral
The soups are tasty, but if you're watching your salt and fat content, go elsewhere. This micro wave able packet may be ok for travelers or lunches, but you can't eat out of it.;neutral
I ate Saki Ika in Japan. They're very delicious. Wal-Pac Saki Ika has, I believe, too much sugar. I really couldn't taste squid. I was disappointed Wel-Pac Saki Ika is not bad.;neutral
Sure it has ginger flavor, but it's not a natural ginger flavor. It does use cane sugar which is good though.;neutral
This is my favorite coffee but the price without coupons is ridiculous. You might as well buy coffee from a coffee shop!;neutral
Good tasting product, but very disappointed to read that the item is shipped to the U.S. in large can containers and then placed in bottles for the American public.  To me that is deceptive.;neutral
a tad too bitter for my taste. I drink my espresso without adding anything to it.;neutral
"QUIK PERFECT5 STARS So, so item IMPRESSIVE SELLER Thanks!
";neutral
It can be a little bitter if you use to much. It is twice as sweet as regular brown sugar so you need to adjust your recipe accordingly. I use it to make low calorie root beer and sweeten breakfast shakes.;neutral
Very convenient and affordable. Minus one star for no recycle logo on bottom of each cup. Minus another star for containing preservatives. Other brands seem to be able to pull this off without them.;neutral
so-so on the taste - flavor not the good;neutral
I found these to be a bit sweeter than I like my tea, but if you like sweet tea, you will probably really like this.;neutral
Not quite dark enough.  Good flavor.;neutral
they are okay, bought for the kids at church - not too sweet.;neutral
Like skinny girl brand better than these.  Flavors are only ok.;neutral
Way too sweet for my taste, but I'm sure I'll find something to use it for.;neutral
Very strong tea, robust and dark. It tastes more tropical than peach to me. I'll stick with Stash Peach Black tea from now on.;neutral
It wasn't strong enough coffee for me. It was for my Mom.;neutral
What I was really looking for was fresh figs, which I recently discovered that I like very much. These canned figs are not quite as good. I wound up not using all of them before they got too old.;neutral
"Very ""fishy"" flavored & Not in a good way...to my taste, anyway.  Not something I'm anxious to buy again.  Will try mixing with philly cheese & lemon juice.";neutral
I bought this for people who don't drink regular coffee. They say its ok, but I think it's too strong for them! I buy the regular for myself, so this was my first inclination.;neutral
Its hot chocolate what can you say....  has a decent taste I'm not a big hot chocolate drinker but the kids are and they seem to like it;neutral
This tea didn't really do much for me slimming wise. It did help my bowel movement sometimes. But other than a good taste that was about it. Product did come within time frame expected.;neutral
This coffee is week with on odor. I will not buy this coffee again.;neutral
love the chocolate chip,did not however like the salted caramel.;neutral
not very chocolate a little weak, had to use two to make one cup;neutral
Lacks flavor. I expected a stronger cheddar taste.;neutral
Pretty good but not up to Hershey's standard s;neutral
Love the ingredients but the bar is bland and dry.  It is quite small.  The cost represents the quality product put into it.;neutral
I've had better. The taste is very bland and the consistency is very runny.;neutral
Good but not great. I had better wagashi than this. My favorite was the red bean paste bun.;neutral
Flavor wasn't that good.  It is sugarless.;neutral
I found the coffee to be on the weak side of the chart. Flavor is ok but not bold enough.;neutral
These we ok. I definitely like the black bean chips a lot better! They have a wonderful flavor... these nacho cheese just didn't cut the mustard.;neutral
Wel, this product tastes very good, but I feel it is just too much money for Pasta.  Plus shipping.  UGH;neutral
There is no excuse for instant coffee grounds. So it is just coacoa;neutral
I don't some snacks including chitos;neutral
Five cute little chocolate bunnies to pop in your mouth and enjoy the chocolate sensation. Tasty treats for all ages.;neutral
The sushi mat is fine, works great, the nori is disgusting, tastes super fishy. But I got it mostly for the mat so whatever.;neutral
Tastes bad. Too many artificial ingredients.;neutral
Good taste but way over priced I found twice the amount for 3 more dollars.;neutral
I like the fava bean crunch and it has a strong vinegar flavor.  I like the other flavors better;neutral
"this coffee is good , I expected more flavor  from the name

I would buy again if price was still low .";neutral
Not as good as original Campbell's chicken noodle.;neutral
Not bad, but the taste wasn't for me. I will be trying Aidells' other recipes instead.;neutral
beans beans, good for your heart, but I think they've changed the recipe over the years so it needs a little doctoring to be a great side dish.;neutral
Not the exact flavor I was looking for. Tastes good all the same.;neutral
These are good.  They are tasty.  They were not terribly expensive.  I will probably order again.;neutral
Tastes more like salted pretzels than bacon to me.;neutral
Sweet it certainly is, but there is very little flavor resembling pumpkin spice. I  tried the Torani sugar free pumpkin spice and it's much better. I'd recommend getting the Torani syrup.;neutral
Taste was okay. I like the amount of protein but it had an aftertaste.;neutral
They taste great but these are very airy and don't last at all.;neutral
Not enough Mushroom flavor for my tastes but it's ok.  I recommend Cooking some mushrooms in boiling water before hand, and adding this broth and mushrooms to the packet when cooking.  Should be better;neutral
"I was expecting more of a rich chocolate taste.
I will try again.";neutral
These are awful. But I knew I didn't like them, and bought them as a gift for a kid that loves them.;neutral
Lots of highly refined high fructose corn syrup;neutral
Good value. Nice flavor. The only drawback for me is they dissolve too quickly, literally breaking apart in less than a minute.;neutral
"Taste, minimum OK.  Crackers too thin.  There is not enough SUBSTANCE in one mini cracker.
 Suitable for use with THICK SLICES of CHEESE or THICK SLICES of VEGETABLES or MEAT.";neutral
These Parmesan crisps are delicious, except a bit salty and very expensive.;neutral
I'm a little on the fence over this. It's not bad, but it's not as good as whatever it is they use where I buy my sushi, and I don't think they splurge on anything special.;neutral
Somehow it isn't as good as I remembered it to be.  I actually taste the acidity in the coffee this time whereas I didn't the 1st times I purchased this brand of Hawaiian coffee.;neutral
This product is fine for seasoning air-popped corn, but I think that is the only thing I would use it for.;neutral
This coffee was OK. Not the best I've ever had but definitely not the worst. With so many other coffees to try, I don't think I'll be buying this one again.;neutral
A bit too chewy for my taste.  Maybe another flavor or consistency would be good.;neutral
The taste is okay.  It's the best I've found that's organic and vegan. It's bit chalky.  It tastes better when you make it into a smoothy with fruit like bananas and strawberries.;neutral
Very gritty in recipes. Sweetens well. Good flavor.;neutral
I love Butterfingers and these were very fresh.  Unfortunately, many of them were broken.;neutral
Great price but we find we're not a fan of coffee mates taste.;neutral
"just ok.
will prob not order again. the taste just inst fresh like a real cookie. there is a taste that is just off with the fiber one chocolate (soft and hard) cookies.";neutral
These lollipops have a great taste. They do not have any staying power. After a few weeks they melted in the jar without any drastic climate change.;neutral
taste is the real problem works great though;neutral
I got this as a 'deal' but I wouldn't have paid full price for it.  Very rich and chocolaty, which is a plus, but I don't taste caramel at all.;neutral
I like it, my wife doesn't.  The coffee turns out just fine and the flavor of Columbian coffee appeals to me.  My wife has other preferences so I am splitting my rating right down the middle.;neutral
Had to give these away, as they contain nuts and I have allergies.  They're very small and don't appear to be healthy.;neutral
Not sure it helps with sleep. Tastes good.;neutral
Spouse says it is just okay. No other comments. Received on time, packaged well. I believe that it is as advertised.;neutral
I tried one of all of them and my opinion is that they're average quality. I'm a little disappointed and I wouldn't give them as a gift. The salted (liquid) caramel was the best though.;neutral
I ordered this for a luncheon for 200 people. The packet is large enough for two people to share for a luncheon salad.;neutral
Not as thrilled with it as I thought I would be - great if all you want to taste is vanilla tho.;neutral
this is the most horrible tasting coffee in my opinion. I will not be buying any more of it. it is too weak. but.... I won't totally blame the coffee as it could be the coffeemaker.;neutral
"Too watery, if ya wan't it nice and thick don't buy the ""Healthy Choice"" stick with the regular.";neutral
"The taste is as good as regular slow cooking steel cut oats but lacks the texture
The short time for preparation makes it a much better choice than rolled oats";neutral
The taste good. But the ingredients are terrible. Nowhere does it say wasabi or soy sauce on them. Its basically msg flavored food. Avoid.;neutral
Tastes ok on a burger but as a dressing, it is so vinegar based that it kind of burns my mouth a little. 3 stars for the effort though;neutral
It taste good but I DONOT LIKE THE IDEA THAT IF YOU WARM IT UP IT LOOSES SOME OF ITS BENEFITS. I LIKE TO PUT HONEY IN my milk at night before I go to sleep,  warm milk. But thats me.;neutral
Great flavor, heft price for a small amount of product.;neutral
Third time trying to create a terrarium and although all of the basics are included within this kit the mold still grew.;neutral
"These taste okay. I thought I would use them more but gave cone to prefer just plain water.

They seem like the ingredients are better than some of the others so that was the reason I gave them a try.";neutral
"It needs a kick of flavor.
A little bland for my taste.";neutral
like all the Batchelors cup o soups it's a little weak on flavour but a nice snack on a cool day;neutral
not keen on the flavor, but that's just a person issue. A friend of mine loves them, so I parted with them and gifted them to her.;neutral
These are not as crispy as I had hoped.  Never tried them before, so I'm guessing that is just what the product is, and my expectations were mistaken.  Taste is okay, sort of caramel-y.;neutral
Nothing special, too much sugary taste;neutral
The order came pretty quickly considering the product is made to order.  The jerky was ok but it was a little greasy for my taste.;neutral
I found another brand cheaper - takes some searching that is organic and has 5 fewer calories per same serving -;neutral
These were too word for me.  I love the cheese it flavor.;neutral
You have to use more than they say, but it is good stevia. Having bought this, I have now gone back to the individual portion bags of pure powder.;neutral
There is nothing wrong wit the tea. My husband didn't expect it to be so strong;neutral
It was just ok....a little bitter.  I really wanted to like it...ended up taking it to work and sharing with everyone.;neutral
Meh, it's o.k.  It's nothing really to write home about.  Tastes about the same as diner coffee as far as I'm concerned.;neutral
Not a lot of carbs, but I don't like the texture.;neutral
Some of these are great some turn out real watery even on the lowest setting.;neutral
First bitter Peet's coffee I have tasted.  Peet's is my favorite brand.;neutral
This brand leave a somewhat bitter after taste compared to many other Sumatra's I've tried previously... which typically seemed equally strong tasting but much smoother and less lastingly caustic.;neutral
Although the flavor is good, all of the packs (seven) of gum I have opened so far are stale.  I couldn't find an expiration date, so I don't know how old the gum.;neutral
Taste like a really strawberry... But the cost is way too high. For a few more bags, I could buy my own dehydrator.;neutral
This spice added tons of flavor to the beans but we still feeling gassy which we had hope that the spice would prevented it.;neutral
The textures are perfect. The taffy and caramel feel wonderful on the tongue. There's a terrific variety of types and flavors. I don't like xylitol.;neutral
Adequate, but nothing special really.;neutral
The olives are medium size -- not large, but they taste fine and are not mushy as some other brands.;neutral
Okay. But not the best value for the price.;neutral
these are okay.  bland flavor - but like the wholesome goodness of them;neutral
I liked this but I think I was allergic.;neutral
I don't care for the after taste of this coffee.  I am glad I only bought a sample pack.  I also didn't notice any change in my metabolism, appetite, or energy after consuming.;neutral
Fresh taste. Not as pictured. More black peppercorns than any other color.;neutral
Definitely took away stars for different Nutrition Facts listed here than what's listed on my bag which is also pictured different here.  Although the nuts are good, I expected them to taste fresher.;neutral
The description really needs to list flavors.  I am returning because I don't like lime, watermelon, or tangerine.;neutral
a bit bland compared to tang, but probably has less sugar as well. i would buy these again if they went on sale, but at the regular price of $6.95 i'll have to pass.;neutral
Harumph, not my favorite ginger. It's not bad but I've had better. For the money, though, it's a nice purchase.;neutral
Everything went fine. Did not like these.;neutral
"Meh, taste is ok, but appearance is not.  These may have once been fillets but now they're just bits
and pieces of multi-colored flesh.  Ok if you mix it with something.";neutral
Still learning how to cook with this product.;neutral
The flavor is awfully bland. Almost tastes watered down.  But it's not chemically and is well-priced.;neutral
Not as smooth as I would have expected.  I have to type twelve more words, and I find that irritating!;neutral
Personally, I didn't like the texture when cooked, but that might not bother someone else.;neutral
empty promises. mediocre coffee. meh.;neutral

These nuts tasted great. I was disappointed that the nuts were so small and that there were so many small broken pieces. This package should have been sold as nuts and pieces rather than as whole nuts.;neutral
Takes a few to do the trick but no complaints with box of none leaking snd not sticky .;neutral
product is not for me, don't like the taste.  otherwise it seems fine tho;neutral
The description says that this is infused with coconut/island flavors. However, the taste, to me, is overwhelmingly like hazelnut. I won't be ordering this one again;neutral
LIKE THIS - IT IS WHAT IT IS - GREAT TASTE ! TONS OF SODIUM THO - DON'T USE IF U HAVE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE PROBLEMS !;neutral
Just okay...not as good as I hoped.;neutral
My daughter loves these, but when they came from Amazon they were all stuck together, like they had melted :(;neutral
Kids will love this but if you're an adult from the Northeast I'd suggest that you pass on this simply due to the flavor of the sauce.;neutral
I found them bland.  Plastic wrapper stuck to the candy.  A few of the wrappers were ripped open.  They weren't awful, I just don't like them enough to ever get them again.;neutral
Gave me some energy but also the jitters and shakes;neutral
Bright flavors.  Just a bit heavy handed with the sweeteners. Won't purchase again due to the cloying sweetness.;neutral
Tried this over ice & blended with ice as well. Not bad in a pinch for the amount of protein grams. Would be nice to have a bit less sugar and a lower price point!;neutral
We've tried other Ready Snax items and they're great, but these berries are hit/miss. We've received them with too little time to enjoy or with too soft berries. I'm sure they're great when they're fresh.;neutral
The taste is good. I like that it has few ingredients and chemical free. But didn't taste fresh. Would like a crisper snap when eating instead of a dull crunch to bite into.;neutral
too grainy for me when i tried it in tea;neutral
Hubby likes the caffeine, but even the smell of this coffee turns my stomach, and I am a huge coffee drinker. It smells greasy and not clean.;neutral
Pops ok, just not the large pop corn I like.;neutral
nothing special...added to dessert table...most not eaten.;neutral
Cannot taste the French Vanilla flavor.  I sure was hoping these had the flavor as that is my favorite flavor.  Won't buy these any more.;neutral
Nothing special. Variety ok but choc not fresh or flavorable.  Will not reorder. Wish there were more sugar free choices.;neutral
I wish there is a way to buy just one package instead of a dozen.  I only needed a half of one package (1 inch strip for each cupcake I made).  But other than that, it served a purpose.;neutral
"The packages came with big stickers ""Ready for shipment,"" on them which were not easy to peel off (makes for tacky looking gifts).
These are tasty, however; they're nicely rich and creamy.";neutral
"The individual packages leave ""room to write a message"" on it. Not a big deal and the product itself was fine. Just looked a little strange - we had them for an event so we were hoping for normal packing.";neutral
Delightful, but the cheese was grainy.  I suggest getting their meat box and get cheese elswhere.;neutral
"I do like these well enough, considering what is available for GF folks.
C@stco has these in 20-count for under 8 bvcks. We should exert pressure on Amazon to lower the price here, it's about 50% high.";neutral
THEY TASE OK, I DONT CARE FOR THEM BUT MY HUSBAND LOVES THEM.;neutral
I am not a big herb tea fan but this has a nice flavor of lemon. Maybe better iced;neutral
Got these as present for wife.  She was disappointed with the quality, compare to what we have gotten in the past.;neutral
I love Cafe Bustelo! The product is great however this product doesn't come in any kind of original packaging. All the coffee pods are stuffed in a regular brown shipping box.;neutral
While this bread is super good, it is a bit more crumbly than I would like.  Tough to put in the toaster, so I've been cooking with eggs, etc.  Very tasty though!;neutral
Depends on flavor.  The cranberry almond are tasteless whereas banana nut are delicious.;neutral
Too heavy for my taste when it comes to decaf.;neutral
These are ok, I loved the Lemongrass so thought I would give them a try.  They are ok.  but not as great as the lemon grass.;neutral
Little flavor or color, more dehydrated than Sprouts market brand, and smaller size . Still pricey. Not as fresh, less moisture than local source.;neutral
Kind of stale, would lose flavor fast;neutral
I'm just not sure. Are these supposed to be bitter like burned coffee? I'm eating them but I still don't understand why they taste like something went terribly wrong.;neutral
Good basic flavor, but not as strong as I like. I have to use 2-3 time the amount it says on the instructions.;neutral
Good but a little too sweet, not enough spice. Big Train Vanilla Chai way better.;neutral
Didn't care much for the flavor of this.  It was lacking.  I will not buy again.  Price was reasonable though.;neutral
After reading previous reviews I expected more chocolate.  Not much chocolate flavor at all.  There is some but not enough for us here.  They did make a great snack but expected more.;neutral
Like the SF variety best. Could rise more.;neutral
Not my cup of tea. Gave it to my granddaughter.;neutral
Nice taste but not strong enough for me.  After I switched to decaf it's difficult finding a dark enough roast for my taste.;neutral
Some good ingredients but high sugar content.  The bars were so hard, I was afraid for my teeth!;neutral
Kids didn't exactly go crazy... but they ate it!;neutral
While this tea is very nice, as chamomile teas go, it definitely does not taste like pineapple. I thought it was a waste of money as chamomile tea can be had for less.;neutral
Chocolate crispy frog ok but hologram card nice!;neutral
Its ok but not worth the price rarely a cashew a ton of almonds :(;neutral
Should have red the reviews regarding the intestinal consequences. Tastes very good but cannot have too many in one sitting, which could be good or bad...;neutral
The coffee has a pretty mellow taste. It is not as strong as I hope it would be, but is one that I would probably buy again. It is good with different kinds of coffee creamer.;neutral
Unblanched makes baked goods more grainy, despite there being no real difference otherwise..;neutral
It's OK.  I like being able to determine how sweet to make my seltzer but this doesn't have much of a ginger flavor.;neutral
It is just a product no review needed;neutral
Really good nuts, but I was surprised at the amount I actually received. Yes, it was 16 ounces But when you hold 16 ounces of nuts in your hands it's not a lot;neutral
Tastes a bit bland, but can't beat the convenience. Doesn't need to be refrigerated, just pop it in the microwave.;neutral
quality didn't stay fresh long even though it was sealed, but was a good price!;neutral
Again, this is a good-tasting popcorn but it is tough.  I was looking for a sweet and tender popcorn.;neutral
The chocolate isn't strong enough, a little artificial tasting... I wanted it to make my peppermint tea to taste like chocolate/peppermint, but it kind of disappears.;neutral
Eh.  They are good quality but not quite my taste.;neutral
They taste alright but something in them upsets my stomach. I don't get upset stomach with most other energy drinks.;neutral
A bit tasteless but healthy non the less;neutral
If you love chocolate this is for you. A little too rich for my taste.;neutral
tis a little on the weaker side of coffee;neutral
These arrived broken, and The flavor was ok, but for me the vans cheese ones are better.;neutral
They don't taste like l thought that they would.;neutral
The taste is not so great.  Better make or buy fresh baba.;neutral
Arrived timely. I use it in my shakes and have noticed that since I changed to this brand the shakes have a bitter taste and just not as good as my previous brand.;neutral
The tea was okay.  I was looking for something with a stronger brewed taste.;neutral
I liked the taste and the bottle if not the price;neutral
"This was a great tasting coffee until the recent price hike; now at its new price I can't justify the convenience.";neutral
if your looking for a trip to the throne well this will get you there.;neutral
"I need it for a gluten free person. It was used for a graduation party! Very helpful.
One of my cousins are in need of a of gluten free cake, so I used this for her.";neutral
It is mostly tastes like brown sugar and erythritol together. I like it better than erythritol alone, but I am not sure it warrants the price.;neutral
A little too salty for me.  Won't order again.;neutral
Been drinking this tea for awhile now, but still can't get use to the taste.  Doesn't taste as good as green or pu-erh.;neutral
Not much jasmine flavor here, but it's an okay tea otherwise. I normally drink dragon jasmine pearls, which knock you over with floral aroma, and was a little disappointed with this.;neutral
"Pretty good, but you have to soak them a little before you can eat them, or they are very hard.
They taste good, and have a lot of beneficial properties.
I have them to salads and oatmeal.";neutral
It has bit of a strange taste to it which I came to find out is what their bread mix tastes like also. I wouldn't purchase again but kudos for an attempt at gluten free pop tarts.;neutral
I like Kind bars but these were very brittle. Perhaps too old?;neutral
Lots of fiber. Parts I had to throw away as it was so woody.;neutral
in matching my expectation to taste like theater popcorn.  But is a good product.  This container is large enough to share with several families and still should last for years.;neutral
Coffee tastes good,but brews less than what you set the amount for.;neutral
Kinda taste like a stale pretzel, a bit to hard. Not really pleased with the product would rather just do without. I donated the rest to a food pantry, maybe someone else will enjoy!;neutral
But as with most other Bob's products it's a little bland. But if you are not a fan of coarse whole wheat breads you will probably like it.;neutral
DO NOT GO BUY ME, JUST DON,T LIKE JASMINE TEA;neutral
This is a tasty snack cracker, but the flavor seems more like Melba toast flavor than the old Nabisco Zweiback flavor that I was hoping to recapture.;neutral
This product is ok and when there is nothing else to eat, I can deal with it but I would not order again.;neutral
Nothing special.  Won't order again as I didn't like how it tasted.;neutral
The chocolate flavors are a bit too bitter tasting and the others are just OK. Probably won't buy again.;neutral
Not too fond of this...not much taste, but hey, I like something to hold onto besides lettuce, when I'm eating a sandwich.;neutral
They were expired per the date on the packages.  Tasted alright chewy.;neutral
Tasty treat, but pricey. 1 bag only. Buyer beware - Shop and compare.;neutral
SMELLS GREAT BUT THOUGHT I WAS GETTING CAROB POWDER AS IT WAS DISPLAYED ON THE SITE FoR CAROBPWoDERS.I WILL ONLY USE TSP AT M OST AS HAVE GERD!!smells great but had t  rdercarb afterwards.;neutral
It tastes very good, but for me it is too mellow.;neutral
Purchased Seed Fruit Nuts because of the great reviews but after reading the fine print I noticed these nuts have sulfates which are not good for the body. I will not purchase these nuts again.;neutral
Ordered these regular pods because we tried the decaf in a hotel and loved them..... but not as fond of the regular blend. So 3 stars because I think the regular tastes on the bitter side.;neutral
I really love sweets. I purchased the cherry, the blueberry and the strawberry. They are good but they are extremely sweet. For me to be saying this is a rarity. They are just too sweet.;neutral
I should have paid more attention to other reviews that said the candy arrived melted.  But I thought that, since the weather was cold, I wouldnt have a problem.  I was wrong.;neutral
Came with INSANE amount of packaging, and still one bottle had leaked.  Really good selection, but the packaging is messed up in multiple ways.;neutral
I actually prefer the taste of the Gluten-Free Mac and Cheese, which is not instant, but has more flavor. The kids are eating this, though, which is a good sign. It is effortless with convenient packaging.;neutral
contains tons of saturated fat etc, if you use it on skin it clogs pores. TO me this wonder product is overrated as for it's actual usefulness.;neutral
Not the best scotch bonnet sauce I've tried. Its OK..;neutral
Next time I will try a stronger blend;neutral
decided I don't care for the sour ones.;neutral
Way too expensive and it is not even organic although they give some reasoning why it has no pesticides which doesn't seem logical.;neutral
bags could be a little looser, to stop the floating in cup to allow tea to diffuse better.;neutral
"Instead of delving into the good let's just talk the Bad.

Even new some batches taste stale
Messy and ridiculous packaging
High and inconsistent pricing
Lack of flavor selection";neutral
Pretty tasty but I still prefer the standard v8 flavor when doused with my own Tobasco or Sriracha;neutral
I was looking forward to trying this soda. no sugar added. Made with various fruit juices. What could go wrong? It just doesn't taste that good. Don't know why. Just disappointed.;neutral
It's just okay.  Don't know what I was expecting, but it wasn't this.;neutral
Most of the crackers were broken us or crushed  Flavor was good;neutral
This almond butter is a little too grainy for what I wanted - I prefer a more blended product, but the taste was fine.;neutral
Too grainy for my liking, but when I add fresh berries into the mix, it helps with the taste.;neutral
Its was ok taste but it was to small especially for the price;neutral
I really like the grapefruit flavor, but this orange is not my favorite. It's nice but too subtle, in my opinion. I usually end up adding at least two packets to my water.;neutral
Red bean center tastes different than what I've eaten all my life.;neutral
I do not care much for the flavor. I had read this was to help blood sugar levels . I have not seen that .;neutral
Not bad, but not great. Maranatha is where it's at;neutral
Thought this coffee for the money was good, just not what i was looking for flavor wise. Nothing bad to say, just not my type of coffee.;neutral
"DOES not even remotely taste like soda! Great as a sweetener but don't be fooled into thinking it will give your water a soda flavor ;)";neutral
"just tried two; early yet to review";neutral
Really disappointed to see this is not vegan or non-GMO. Will not order again;neutral
it has a unique taste. the snack will not appeal to everyone. it is very brittle. maybe try it with canned cheese?;neutral
Delicious! but all pieces were broken, unusable for the presentation I desired.. So I ate them all..;neutral
Need to chew 2 pieces compared to other brands like Spree. Taste doesn't 't last very long.;neutral
The bag we got had a few bits of hard shell, discovered while eating it. Enough reason for us to stick to other brands, but it might have been an exception.;neutral
"Do not order yogurt covered anything during warm months. I have a nice yogurt block to slice from. ;-)";neutral
It's a good product but it arrived with the chips melted together.;neutral
Not enough clams and a bit salty for me;neutral
I like to have this on hand, especially for company who travel and need a cup in the morning. Taste isn't great, but does the job!;neutral
This would be better with more guacamole chunks.  It's too smooth for my taste.  And for a spicy guacamole, it's pretty tame.  Not at all hard-core.  More middle of the road.;neutral
The laste and texture are not as good as the prunes I normally buy.;neutral
Quality of all was overall good.  Just on drawback... not all were accepted by my Keurig machine.  Gave those to someone with an older machine.;neutral
Doesn't taste good ,and doesn't taste 100% juice .;neutral
Dry and crusted with crystals.  Almost too sweet.  I'm going back to mission figs.;neutral
Not bad as a cheesy flavoring but the blue cheese flavor is extremely weak.;neutral
It's fine.  Sometimes hard to open little doors without tearing a bit.;neutral
I like the regular flavor MUCH better, but this is decent.;neutral
I rated three stars because there are a lot of seeds and skin in these diced tomatoes.;neutral
A great product to use as a gift for a friend.;neutral
Very expensive. Tastes like 'regular' salt. I don't get it.;neutral
Great pack of yumminess... Great packaging;neutral
A bit pricey for peanut butter. I didn't think it lived up to the hype of the other reviews I had read, but a decent product overall/;neutral
Not bad for canned. Has a low fat tasting thinness to the cream and cheese. And for canned soup, the price could be lower.;neutral
I don't mind this stuff but i was so happy when wife's doctor said we didn't have to watch sodium this pregnancy. It can certainly be worked with tho just keep tasting and seasoning with what ya can use.;neutral
These are smaller than I thought they'd be but they do taste good.;neutral
its fresh but has a slightly bitter taste. overall quality ok;neutral
Not enough rose for me,  liked the Tulsi Lemon Ginger well though. Tulsi or Holy Basil is an excellent herb for health though so it is fine.;neutral
Just not the same taste as the senses type pods. It is just ok.;neutral
Product is great, but shipping stinks - every time I've ordered, there were leaks.  Poor quality control.;neutral
Good, but the flavoring is a little weak.;neutral
I'm still trying to get used to the flavor. It's supposed to taste like cheese, and I am trying it because I am on a dairy-free diet.;neutral
Somehow, these don't taste as good as the canned ones;neutral
not my favorite but has a good ingredient list;neutral
I love McCann's instant oatmeal, but this particular flavor was a big disappointment. It has a slight honey/vanilla flavor and seems a little gummy compared to their other oatmeals.;neutral
Packaging leaked... but product ok.;neutral
I didn't find the flavor of this very strong so it was rather disappointing.  So far I've tried three flavors and find that the cinnamon is stronger, and the coconut more flavorful.;neutral
Raisins tasted good but there are too many stems. I have not been able to just eat or bake with these because I have to sift through them to try to find the random inedible pieces.;neutral
I find these raisins a  bit small but they are good.;neutral
"Meh.  Sorry, not worth the price and wait.  Expected far more ""punch"" to this mole blend, but it's very mild/bland.";neutral
I wanted to try to compare this to PG Tips decaf, which I had been drinking. I live PG tips better, my astringency.;neutral
The product was good but all 6 cans were dented.;neutral
The mix is a little heavy handed towards the walnuts and almonds and some of the nuts were spoiled. Rest of the nuts tasted fine.;neutral
Did not really meet expectations.  Arrived completely separated.  Very hard to mix/blend so wound up tasting like largely flavorless grease - almost nauseatingly so.;neutral
Not really mango but nice for the person tired of plain water.;neutral
It is ok, can't say much about it.  It doesn't have much of a taste and not sure if it helps the gout or not.;neutral
"Should be called potatoes with corned beef.

Flavor of corned beef was missing, maybe because it was reduced fat.

Consider it storage food.";neutral
"good but not my fav.  some batches are better than others, i guess. Like the natural pungent sweetness when I bite into them.
If you are using in smoothie........it doesn't matter these will do the job.";neutral
Remember those jelly-like gumdrops? Just like that but with a hint of ginger.;neutral
"The brine is overpowering ; at the same time I realize it's needed for preservation , So , you have to ad fresh water for dilution purposes.";neutral
Not the best, but not horrible either.;neutral
Doesn't have much taste.  I've not noticed my blood pressure being controlled, however.;neutral
Half stale, half fresh. They're hard to find and this is the best price for the amount.;neutral
This is alright. Was not sweet enough for me. Had to add sugar. I have other Starbucks cocoa that I really like though.;neutral
I had high expectations for this brew and was disappointed by the flat cup of coffee brewed.;neutral
VERY spicy, don't use the whole packet, add your own spices to make up for the loss!;neutral
these were OK but I prefer the ones that are covered in coconut;neutral
Too much non meats like chicken potato stuff.;neutral
Sort of weak in the flavor department. Taste is pleasant but not very intense.;neutral
It is hard to dip onto bread or other use and hope have some change to soft gel but I still like it.;neutral
I didn't like it very much.  The chai tea taste was weaker than I expected and not what I expected.;neutral
"I love Ginger. This is Orange and ginger. Note Orange is listed first. It's more Orange than ginger.
If you like orange, you'll love this. All the TRUE products are great.";neutral
The actual product has not been eaten, yet. The package has not been opened, yet. The package is intact. I've been tempted to open it, but, it's a gift.;neutral
Fortune cookies are a favorite, I put them in my waiting room. I'm disappointed in the cliche fortunes. Also the cookies look a little small. Gonna keep looking.;neutral
I cannot comment on the pomegranate taste or flavor due to the fact that I had returned it because it was not sealed very well when I got it, and I am VERY funny about food items that are not sealed properly;neutral
"These are good quality.  They are moist and chewy, but have a little too much molasses flavor for my taste.
My husband liked them better than I.";neutral
My favorite chip of all but.....Every bag has 1/3 broken pieces in the bottom. Can't dip with fragments. They need to take care that problem and it will go five stars with me.;neutral
Drinkable , just OK, thin.  Slimfast  is better.;neutral
"Flavor is good, but these are bitter (for my taste). I can only use a couple drops to get ""the flavor,"" because of the overwhelming bitterness from stevia. Nice packaging & easy to carry in briefcase or desk.";neutral
It is slightly on the weak side - have to use a bit more.;neutral
I know they're unsalted but like eating wallpaper paste, no flavour, other unsalted brands do.;neutral
I purchased these as a snack for my gluten free diet.  I feel they are just okay and I would not purchase them again.  I prefer the sesame bars instead.;neutral
This was good but they went up on price after my first buy :(;neutral
These were pretty banged up by the time I got them.  Lots of bruising, like the bag had been dropped a couple of times.  Don't think I would order these again.;neutral
The taste was more bitter than for my favorite teas.;neutral
I like that it only has a few ingredients but it is high calorie and not very tasty.;neutral
If you want to avoid coffee or tea for a while or forever, this will help! The taste reminds to plain black coffee, but with no jitters.;neutral
Better than some sugar free BBQ sauces I've used. It has a weird aftertaste to it. I think for my tastes it will be better to make my own from scratch.;neutral
"Its ok easy cooking
Good for a change of pace";neutral
Haven't cooked them yet. Weill evaluate when cooked.;neutral
For people who like hazelnut this is good.  It seems that coffee in the k-cups comes out mild without a strong flavor.  The guests like this coffee.;neutral
Not really as cheesy as advertised.  It definitely does not perform like I thought it would, not even on popcorn!;neutral
Cookies were delicious. Tin came dented, some cookies were crushed. Also sent as a gift to my son and he also received the tin dented. Quick shipping.;neutral
The flavor in this product disappears quickly and what you have left is a plastic-like product bouncing around within your mouth.  Not a nice experience.;neutral
This unexpectedly has the texture of spam. It has good flavor but I prefer beef that you can't cut with a butter knife.;neutral
Okay, but I don't like the way they taste as much as I thought I would.;neutral
Funny aftertaste. I don't use any longer.;neutral
To mild. wanted wasabi with more kick.;neutral
not as good as the regular Jamacian Blue Mountain;neutral
Um, they are interesting. Acquired taste. Not terrible. Filling;neutral
These breakfast biscuits need a little more work. They taste okay, but you sometimes get grit or loose dried grains that you don't expect. I don't find them filling at all.;neutral
I am a total coffee snob, it is just okay- i'm not running for a second cup;neutral
A little too fruity for me.  Will be making in the summer and adding fresh fruit.  A Doctor Oz purchase.;neutral
They are as I remember. There was a good variety. However as others have said many were broken so I will not be reordering.;neutral
They're good if you want something sweet and fruity, but not very filling.;neutral
These are pretty ok. The taste isn't amazing but they keep me full for several hours.;neutral
Good coffee but just a bit too strong for me - I couldn't add enough cream to cut it.  BEt you will wake up fast with just one cup of this!;neutral
I was not that impressed with the BBQ flavor, but I do like the sour cream & onion ones the best;neutral
the bread was a little done by the time I got it but made some really great sandwiches with the 1st loaf, the second loaf didn't last long enogh to get any useful pieces out of it.;neutral
This coffee is very very strong and bitter I didn't expect that. I normally like strong coffee but this is a bit much.;neutral
when u get it use it quick or freeze or put in fridge as he starts getting funcky too quick;neutral
I didn't really like the taste of this on my steak.  It's just ok.  I probably will not use again.  It was the taste of coffee that I didn't like on my steak.;neutral
This was shipped pretty fast, but the popcorn was insanely hot to the point where we couldn't eat it after taking one bite.;neutral
All stuck together, but that is not fault of the seller.;neutral
The taste isn't as good as it use to be but this was used more for a school art project than food.  I think the glue tasted better than the pretzel.;neutral
Better than Rosso Cafe, not as good as Nespresso.;neutral
Not one of my favorite's.  But someone else might find it fine;neutral
I usually buy Turkish delight candies from HazarBaba but decided for a change. The candies by Marmara are very small and very chewy. I do not like them as much as the brand I usually buy.;neutral
Best used lightly. I'm a gravy fan and was hoping this would be similar to my grandmother's but it doesn't taste as I expected. It's not bad, but it's not my new favorite.;neutral
It okay.  I did noticed a distinct taste to these. Not really fond of it but it's bearable.;neutral
If you can get over the consistency it is not that bad...a little tart and just a little too weird for me to ever order again. Plus the price was INCREDIBLY STEEP!;neutral
"Has a mild licorice taste.
I like mine with more intense flavor.
I won't be buying anymore of this item.";neutral
Bought these for someone else, and they said they were pretty decent.;neutral
If you don't mind them not being totally raw they're okay. Kind of oily tho, which is off putting. They aren't the worst. But I won't be buying them again.;neutral
Some of the coffees won't work in my Keurig though the title gives the impression that all of the K Cups come from Green Mountain, they do not.;neutral
Had great expectations for this one, but unfortunately it caused constipation, and stomach aches, and overall the flavor was okay, nothing overwhelming.;neutral
flavor great...texture not so great;neutral
this batch was not fresh and when brewed taste is kind of burn. The company is awesome and very kind, they return my money since I was not satisfied. Thanks again.;neutral
"Very strong caramel flavor and very ""sweet"" tasting because of it. We didn't like it too much.";neutral
I thought this tea was OK. I am a big fan of Yogi and this is my least favorite flavor of tea they offer. Never really tasted any caramel;neutral
I think this is a pricey turmeric. The taste and flavor is alright but I have had better turmeric and for a much less price.;neutral
Barely has any apple flavour, which isn't what I was hoping for! It's not bad but very ,very subtle...don't expect a proper apple tea!;neutral
Not as flavorful as the real stuff but a fair substitute;neutral
Of course, not as good as sugar but acceptable.  The taste is not what would prevent me from buying again.  It's the price.;neutral
This K-Cup was just OK. I felt it was lacking in robustness and strength. I don't know if they even offer this anymore but I suggest passing on it!;neutral
Tastes great but everyone who ate it had an upset stomach for the next three days;neutral
These were ok snacks thought would try but won't buy again. Prefer fresh apples , but tried on sales and oatmeal .;neutral
It taste good but it's a bit weird i appears a lot in parts of the noodles, there're darker brown color like burned;neutral
Maybe I've just never had real Earl Grey tea before, but the bergamot flavor is overwhelming in my batch.  I've given it a few tries but still find it unpleasant.;neutral
"the organic grade is better...
  too small a quantity...";neutral
This product has an extremely long shelf life which is why I wad willing to buy 3 loaves. And why I was frustrated and annoyed to receive loaves with only a few months left.;neutral
These were cute, and silver colored, but a little duller than described.  I was looking for real shiny looking star.  cute, but if you want shiny, go wit the tiny disco dust. super white.;neutral
price much higher than Costco I learned but delicious in yogurt;neutral
Texture is definitely an acquired taste. It's not awesome and it's not the worst thing you'll ever eat.;neutral
Ordered the unsalted by mistake, like the salted ones much better.;neutral
adds nice flavor to broths. expensive. takes a heaping T. to add good flavor.;neutral
"Good size and fair price.  Ordered a larger size for
better price from different vendor through Amazon.
But still a good off season value.";neutral
This one is just a little to bitter, have to add extra hot water, I would never purchase again.  Good price, but for my breakfast coffee I prefer milder.;neutral
Honey Green Tea didn't take good. Loves the peach. Wont buy again.;neutral
Not as good as the sweet onion but still tasty.;neutral
I found this particular flavor to be much drier than other Kashi bars I have had in the past. Still, healthy and enjoyable.;neutral
It is light in sodium, but not for me...just didn't taste enough like chicken noodle soup.  Mix it with another soup and it works.;neutral
it's sugar! kinda hard to mess it up!;neutral
I was hoping to get a true navy color out of my fondant with this gel. However it was no different then the regular blue americolor gel. A nice color but not as Navy as I had hoped for.;neutral
They are good but not that good so I would recommend off the grocery shelf first.  Semi-sweet choc bars are better;neutral
Well, it's Ginger Root, what can you say about that? It has the ginger root flavor and that's what I expected.;neutral
It's OK taste-wise. The veggie meatballs are off-putting, I'd rather it was just the spaghetti and sauce. Overall not worth it for the price.;neutral
Munkijo Organic Coconut Water is one of several brands I bought and tried. Overall, it tasted a little like the container and the cost of the the case was a little pricier than the brand I ended up choosing.;neutral
"Not my favorite. The taste doesn't last very long. I didn't love the texture, either.
For the all organic lover; not so much the chocolate lover.";neutral
Very tasty syrup.  Much sweeter than I am used to, as it has much more sugar than orange blossom flavor...  Not a bad product, but very, very sweet, and not as flavorful.;neutral
THE ORDER ARRIVED AS PROMISED AND WHILE I DID NOT LIKE THE TASTE OF THE SAUSAGE MY GRANDCHILDREN DID;neutral
Too sweet. Prefer more ginger bite. Taste like apple pie..if that's what you want.;neutral
Flavor is ok. Not for picky people like me... Good for backup incase you stuck with no milk or creamer;neutral
Arrived in great condition. It is my fault it expired. I just didn't pay it proper attention. I'd purchase one again.;neutral
Unlike the Tasty Bite brand these you have to take out of the bag to heat and they are not spicy enough for my taste.  Besides you then have clean up to do.;neutral
I think this coffee was overly hyped. It tastes okay, but is nothing I would order again. Of course, flavor is somewhat objective, so others may really enjoy this coffee!;neutral
"Great tasting gum---- although flavor disappears almost as fast as it took for you to put it into your mouth ;-)";neutral
Not bad but I have had better with better maple flavor then these at a cheaper price. Doubt if I will be back for more;neutral
Thinner than expected Too much paper on them.;neutral
I couldn't taste very much from this, but the other reviewers liked it so I might've gotten a bad batch.;neutral
Pretty good stuff, but I would rather have had flavorings without sugar and salt in it.;neutral
It's a good product, just wish I wouldn't have bought it, it's so freaking expensive.;neutral
If you don't know what Kombucha is, look it up! I bought a whole case thinking it's an herb but boy was I wrong... The taste is not bad at all...similar to a green tea with a little sugar.;neutral
Ok,But More Flavor Would Be Nice !!;neutral
Too thick. Hard to remove from container.;neutral
It is good but we prefer the one in the green package with a tiny touch of sugar included.;neutral
Doesn't taste like cheese as I'd expected, so I'm not eating as much of it as I usually do.;neutral
The seeds came well packaged and quickly.  I just don't like them. I wanted to try them but don't like them at all.;neutral
This is much more bland et weak than I recall it. I like dark roast coffee et this is much more light to medium. Not worth the high price at all;neutral
besides the crab shell in it , it was not as much of a lump type crab as I had hoped for . had a lot of  dark bits and pieces to it almost to the point of shredded left overs. I will not buy again.;neutral
The stevia taste was too strong for me, but this company also sells unsweetened lemon crystals and their customer service is excellent.;neutral
It seemed a little weak lacking a real coffee flavor.;neutral
"Taste is Diet Coke. Smaller sizes help a lot. Good to have on hand.
Arrived quickly. Just not really a fan.";neutral
They are better than no crackers, but they are certainly not crackers.  Kinda like seed glued together.  a crunch only.;neutral
To me it's a weak/light tea. I was hoping for a stronger cinnamon flavor. I actually can't tasted an cinnamon. So if you're looking for a cinnamon tea I would pass on this kind.;neutral
$31lb seems very expensive for gummy bears!;neutral
Not for the faint of heart or the person who expects Licorice that tastes like what most Americans are familiar with. Don't expect nibs or licorice ropes. This is the real European stuff.;neutral
drinking it now, still waiting for the taste to come;neutral
Used in a homemade deodorant. So far: doing its job.;neutral
I love the taste. Found them a lot cheaper at the farmers market.  Paid a bit too much for this purchase.;neutral
WE HAVE BEEN ORDERING THIS QUITE REGULARLY LATELY AND IT'S ALWAYS SOFT & FRESH BUT THIS ONE WAS HARDER AND NOT AS TASTY.  OBVIOUSLY NOT FRESH NEEDLESS TO SAY DISAPPOINTING!!!;neutral
Product is amazing but this prime shipment arrived 4 days late;neutral
This was my first time buying this brand.... They were just okay.;neutral
These are HOT!  I generally loke highly spiced things, but have resorted to using these in casseroles such as Texas ranch chicken.;neutral
not as strong a flavor as I had hoped..;neutral
These taste good but some of them are hard and difficult to bite.  Combination of stale and non stale.  Also the bucket is huge.  Like Costco huge.  I'd buy them again.  Great value.;neutral
I thought that this would have better packaging it came in a bag without the ability to reseal.  I did like the product though.;neutral
Doesn't seem the freshest,  the coconut fat is as hard as a rock on top.  I have to scoop everything out and then hit it with my stick blender to make it usable!;neutral
the pomegranate and peach don't taste good;neutral
Their good. Not as good as the black bean chips though.;neutral
9 packages, 6 were whole cookies, 3 were nothing but pieces.  The three that were in the bottom of box were the ones that were all broken up.;neutral
"Like licorice, this cinnamon has good flavor but it is not satisfying to eat.

I feel like I am sucking on glass.  I like chewy candy or round hard candy";neutral
Wasn't impressed. Cookies tasted processed and cheap. Everything was fine in the package. No broken cookies. Packages were intact. We just didn't like them... didn't stop everyone from eating them though.;neutral
Average coffee. Strong but not robust with great flavor.;neutral
"While these are not the highest quality peanuts, they do satisfy the ""munch and crunch"" snack appetite.";neutral
Not happy about ultra pasteurized but it was a satisfactory product;neutral
The quality of the oil for the price is amazing, but opening the packaging was so hard, and some oil had leaked through the package.;neutral
"I personally am not a fan of the taste.  It's a bit stron for me.  The tea brews well as far as I can tell. I'm not a ""tea expert"".";neutral
My Oolongs are when black and green ain't the THANG to drink.;neutral
"I love the product and the fact that it's natural and made with Stevia, but really didn't enjoy all of the flavours.
Unfortunately, not a fan of the variety pack";neutral
I love this brand however I did not like the flavor of the 7 grain.  I prefer the Almond milk so I will not buy this flavor again.;neutral
ONE BOX, NOT 6.  Biscuits are good, but it was only one box, not six like the description indicates.;neutral
Some good samples but too many I did not care for.;neutral
can't tell the difference, for the money, in the taste;neutral
As much as I generally like the usual cup noodles, this doesn't really do much for me. It's just okay, in my opinion.;neutral
Would like it sweeter like with stevia.;neutral
This is good coffee. Not awesome, but a good medium roast. This was my main go-to kcup until I tried the Caribou. Caribou is much better IMHO.;neutral
I'm not crazy about hhow strong the flavor is.  I wish I could get a non-mint flavor.;neutral
flavored water,over priced should be 50 cents a can max;neutral
It's OK, kind of watery.  I use this less expensive brand when my grandkids are around, because they douse everything with syrup.;neutral
Haven't had an occasion to use this yet, but the bottle is a generous amount that should last me a long time.  Will update review when I use it.;neutral
The taste is great, but the flavor only lasts about two minutes. Trident lasts so much longer.;neutral
Taste is amazing but it leaked during shipping. Box was oily. Plastic seal was intact but foil seal was loose.;neutral
Excellent flavor, but many tiny pieces and too many unpopped or partially popped kernels.;neutral
Not tasty or spicy.  Maybe anything canned is never going to match the deliciousness of freshly made New Mexico green chile.  Maybe it's impossible.  I am just going to have to travel there more often.;neutral
To high priced for the amount you get;neutral
Tastes ok, but not good enough to buy again.;neutral
Not bad. I was served this in a B&B in Sedona and loved it. It's good but I prefer Peet's French Roast. I like strong rich coffee. Community's is a bit milder.;neutral
Like but hard to find recipies this will fit into.;neutral
clumps a little in coffee but maybe I am not used to this format would go for liquid soy in the future;neutral
Good quality, but not one of my favorite beans. I like the others though.;neutral
It's okay but not as smoky tasting as I had hoped. In fact there is more of a smell of smoke when it's first sprinkled but I don't really taste it on the food.;neutral
Smaller than expected and dried out. The deep dish at Costco for $9.99 is much better.;neutral
I like jif better idk just depends on what people's taste is;neutral
Yet again, the vindaloo curry powder packs nice flavor, but it's just got too much sweetness in it.;neutral
There was a lot still have this very very happy about this.;neutral
Not very wholesome since it contains almost as much sugar as sugar ... but at least it isn't loaded up with chemicals;neutral
The bacon somehow doesn't get crispy, it got a jerky consistency instead.  That made it kinda hard to eat.  Switching back to American-made bacon.;neutral
"A little of this goes a long way.  Personally I do not care for it; but for those who like spicy hot flavor, it would probably be a great addition to pasta or pizza.";neutral
Good but not great. Harney is a great tea company but came up a little short as far as the tea.;neutral
Package was torn upon arrival with rice in box.  Did arrive quickly.  Other items arrived fine.  Too much hassle to try to return.;neutral
I'm giving this three stars. Even though it tastes great, you still have to stir the almond butter a little bit to spread it. It's just like any other almond butter so I don't think it's worth the price.;neutral
"Haribo's Fruit Salad is Way too sweet; not like the sweet/sour of their Gummi candy! A real disappointment. I would have really liked it if there were more citrus and tang to the candy.";neutral
This is a great treat during the holidays. Unfortunately, two of the four boxes were a big gooey mess on one side. It is winter time...;neutral
Nice, subtle flavor - not over powering, but nothing particularly special either.;neutral
"fair.  i don't think it tastes anywhere close to real PB, but given the sheer amount of PB that i consume, i'd pretty much consider myself a PB aficionado.  ;)";neutral
liked this much better than I expected but its pretty basid;neutral
Bought this pack of three flavors to compare with Justin's.  These were all just ok,  7 out of 10 here preferred the Justin's over Barney's;neutral
use the 8 oz settings as 10oz is a bit too weak.  Nice flavor selection but not as strongly flavored as the other Keurig brands I've used before.;neutral
Big problem is the coating.  Its very soft.  You can't eat the bar without getting sticky fingers.  You can keep in fridge, but that does not help when you are out of the house.;neutral
It didn't live up to the hype of being number one.  Wasn't bad but wasn't number one...;neutral
heavy on the peanut butter but very light on the jelly. gave it away after one bar.;neutral
Like the pineapple it lacks a littie more flaver;neutral
pretty good but a little to pickle for  me I mix it with clamato juice or v8;neutral
Perfectly functional K-cups, we didn't have any of the issues other reviewers reported.  That said, this was not a favorite in our house, we won't buy it again.;neutral
It's freaking water. H20, I bought it for my aunt. She's definitely smarter now since she neglecting paying me back the cost.(joke) My aunt belief in these water is real though.;neutral
the dispenser not goog, other wise  yes it is salt.;neutral
Not as good as the medium roast. Which is odd because I've always always always preferred dark roasts. Still not bad, just not as good by any means.;neutral
This candy bar was so so. The flavor was very different. I probably wouldn't buy this candy bar ever again.;neutral
I love this but I realized I'm spending over $1 on tea. Time to go back to the bags!!;neutral
A bit bland...spice it up with your favorite veggies;neutral
I have tried several varieties. I found this one to have a crisp flavor but lacking in body.  It's a good cup of coffee but nothing remarkable.;neutral
These guys were needlessly acidic.  I understand the role of vinegar here but I had to cut it in half to eat these things. Other than that they were fine.;neutral
not cheap  $0.55 each for 6 cookies  3 were broken;neutral
Are fine but have to make myself eat them. No taste at all.;neutral
Very small jar for the price. Gets runny in the cabinet and too hard in the fridge. Don't care for the texture. The taste is average.;neutral
Very, very sweet. Convenient to grab and run, but I actually love carbs and sugar and these were too sweet for me!;neutral
Was just o.k. not going to reorder.;neutral
I guess there is nothing like real bread. Good for a subsitute, need lots of butter, jam or peanut butter. Just my opinion.;neutral
Wasn't so impressed with bloody Mary flavor. Love all the others, especially the habanero.;neutral
These are ok. I wasn't crazy about the taste of some of them and they all tended to be weak for my taste. A nice gift for someone who may be an occasional tea drinker.;neutral
This coffee was ok...but Death Wish Coffee is better.;neutral
I like the flavor but these are too strong.  I ended up buying some plain almonds and mixed them together.  That did the trick for me.;neutral
The taste is anything but delicious. Very bland, other than that its fine.;neutral
Good for thickening my potato soup!;neutral
The flavored coffees are undrinkable, though the regular roasts/blends are good. I didn't read what came in it very closely before I bought it, so that's my bad.;neutral
I know this is flavored coffee, but it's a little too flavored for me.  It works best when I add it to a half-finished cup of regular.  That tones it down.;neutral
Taste is awful by its self, but the burn is fantastic!! could add this to a chili or other foods and give them a great burn while possibly improving on the flavor.;neutral
No salt, but it still tastes OK. I get used to the bland flavor about halfway through.;neutral
I really like the shelled ones better.  These are o.k. but like the unsalted ones in shells better.  Won't purchase again.;neutral
Bob's red Mill, I have always found to be a good supplier of quality products who also offer organic as well as grains, and a multitude of flours to do your baking.;neutral
Thought it tasted a little bitter. It was okay.;neutral
It was not extra bold so it was returned.;neutral
It had a lot of crushed candies in it but for halloween. . . . I guess it was ok.;neutral
these were much smaller containers than i expected and therefore were overpriced.  the product works fine, but they are TINY;neutral
a bit over the top - I notice they have disappeared however, so someone in this house likes them better than I do.;neutral
I think this is misnamed.  It should be white sesame seeds with garlic.  I am using it but I won't be reordering it.;neutral
The box and the candies weigh 1 pound. There's only about 20 to 30 pieces of candy.;neutral
Does not dissolve so dissolve in a warm liquid first.  Taste ok in cold drinks but didn't like in my hot drinks. Couldn't drink in my coffee ruined it!!!;neutral
THIS COFFEE IS VERY LIGHT AND THE CARAMEL FLAVOR IS BARELY THERE.  FOR ME PERSONALLY, I WOULD NOT PURCHASE THIS AGAIN.;neutral
Was on a very strict diet and this is the only type of gum that was allowed.  The flavor didn't last very long at all and the gum got hard quickly.;neutral
Not as fresh as other items in my order;neutral
not used to this as a replacement for coffee;neutral
Not as tasty as I expected. Won't order again.;neutral
Didnt realize artificial sugar is used. My daughter wouldnt even eat it. Going to be giving it away to someone who doesnt mind the artificial sugar.;neutral
Great alternative to coffee but a bit difficulty to use.  Doesn't work in keurig.;neutral
Little to no bacon flavor, but does have a wonderful smokiness to it. As far as spiciness goes this is about a 3 or 4, not very spicy but leaves a mild kick in the after taste.;neutral
I really liked these when I first ordered them.  They are healthy.  After getting over the excitement, I find these kind of bland.  Healthy, nonetheless.;neutral
I was trying to find tea that tastes like what you get in restaurants. I'm drinking this now and it tastes bitter. It also has no pleasant aroma that some tea has.;neutral
It's my first time trying dried basil leaf in my own cooking, and I think I'd much rather stick with the fresh stuff.;neutral
Maybe I don't understand how to use it properly.  Just been disappointed with the taste.;neutral
its okay tea not sure I would order it again though;neutral
Product was melted together when it arrived.;neutral
Too strong and bitter for my tastes.;neutral
Ok if you cannot have gluten but too sweet for me.;neutral
Taste okay, something different for winter, little expensive as with all K-cups.;neutral
I need something more convenient so I went back to the hydrolyzed form by Great Lakes which I just put in my cup of coffee in the morning.;neutral
the taste is sweet but not to hazelnut. The texture is thick and not creamy like the original. Because of the thickness of it i will not purchase this again.;neutral
Caramel flavor isn't as strong but they're good.;neutral
It's okay, but has an aftertaste that tastes like diet soda to me. Didn't see anywhere that it had artificial sweeteners, but tastes like it does.;neutral
Very strong, less is more.  I like dark chocolate, but this has a sharpness to it that I'm not loving -- it is seriously dark chocolate.;neutral
"I used this to make my ""almond meal"" cornbread tastes more corny. It worked.";neutral
I don't eat meat so I was very happy to find these veggie noodles. Unfortunately, I had to add alot of soy sauce and other spices to perk up the almost non-existant flavor.;neutral
Crumbly. Tasty. Lots of nuts. Fits the bill for a mid afternoon snack.;neutral
There ok but not that great. I probably won't order them again.;neutral
Wow these are sweet! I kept eating them i couldn't figure out if i liked them or not! I just kept eating them. I ate half the box!;neutral
The decaf is very weak and not too tasty.  But I bought it, I'll drink it and I won't stay up all night.;neutral
Bubbly, good price. Make sure you like pear flavor as it overpowers the peach.;neutral
"Yes, poppies emerged.  However, they seem puny and less robust compared to those from the Home Depot poppy seeds.

I'll revise my review once I know what the seeds produce.";neutral
I love having a cup of herbal tea during my nightly soak. With that said, this product has a little bit of an artificial taste to it. Still an enjoyable product.;neutral
It's good, but we prefer WRIGHT'S All Natural Applewood Liquid Smoke.;neutral
These... I just can't get them to work. They are way too chewy right out of the bag and soaking them didn't help much. Anyone have energy ball recipes to use these in? Would love recommendations. Thanks!;neutral
"didn't like the way it made my coffee taste the after taste was almost like it was spoiled or sour.
but the price was good.";neutral
Coffee was nice and fresh. Was a little bitter for my taste.;neutral
Tastes as expected, and product quality was good.  Price is too expensive compared to local grocery store.;neutral
Not so great gum. Good for like 5 minutes tops. Surely, someone can crack the code for Stevia gum;neutral
Spinach & Kale are listed last - These Chips are Mainly Masa Corn & Allergic to Corn  )-:;neutral
Flavor fades quickly, and I find its use for dry mouth only fair.  Trident and Stride seem to work better and flavors last much longer.;neutral
I wish this were a chunky sauce. It is pretty unchunky and so it makes me feel like it has less veges than I wanted. I can just add my own veges to a cheaper sauce and have it be much much better.;neutral
A bit too salty, and has sour aftertaste which I don't like.;neutral
This is not worth the price increase.  It's ok, but not for an excessive amount of money.;neutral
being VEGAN have something taste like Chickens not good - soup is ok;neutral
This is still a good product, but not great. They changed the formula recently and I don't like the texture as much. But it's still pretty awesome since it's so allergy friendly!;neutral
Exceptionally fragrant but really nothing great. Just like every other run of the mill panettone.;neutral
Pretty much on salty side with little flavor.  They are good but will not buy again.;neutral
I bought this for my husband who dearly loves ravioli (original) but he was not thrilled with this. I tried it too, it wasn't bad, but it tasted to me like it might have had some itlian sausage mixed in.;neutral
Not as fresh as I anticipated, but very good indeed.;neutral
Dont really like the taste of this chocolate Brownie flavor. The Iced oatmeal cookie is much better. Even my Co-workers love it.;neutral
The Pears taste good but when I open the bag the fumes are horrible. I've got no idea what it is but I wish they could do something about it. Very strange.;neutral
too much sugar, stopped eating it because of that;neutral
Soup is good, but the container are what I would call waterproof which is something you want if it contains your soup.;neutral
Too expensive for this amount as it is usual for small packaging. I found a larger bag with dried seaweed mix (3.52-ounce) with different colors of seaweed. It is very easy to make your own dressing.;neutral
Not fair for me to rate this. I do not drink the stronger coffees but purchased to serve to others and have not done so yet.;neutral
Overall a puny flavor even for an herbal tea.  Slight apple flavor and slight tart flavor but no real evidence of cranberry flavor.  Is disappointing.  .;neutral
The flavor of these is great. Unfortunately more than half of the pops arrived broken into several pieces. Would've been 5 stars if they were intact;neutral
lots of popcorn kernels fully popped. When applying butter afterwards, it almost disappears. Nice flavor, full puffs, better eaten dry;neutral
I hate to say it, but they tasted old as if they sat on the self for quite awhile. Other than that they were good. I would not buy in huge bulk like me.;neutral
Ordered the sea salt version by mistake... oh well... my bad.  Found the salty taste not to my liking.;neutral
Okay but I don't think I would purchase again since I like other brands more.;neutral
The popcorn it's self was okay.  the seasoning was awful!;neutral
Meh.  Definitely a variety of flavors, but not that many that I enjoyed.;neutral
What can I say, its salad dressing.;neutral
I was hoping for more of a oatmeal raisin walnut cookie flavor. These are just straight oatmeal raisin walnut. With walnut being the dominant flavor.;neutral
The apple ones tasted fine but the pears and bananas were not good at all. My daughter wouldnt even eat them.;neutral
it looks just like the picture.  Bought it for internal use.  I ad half a tsp to 40 oz of water.  Sealed well, but would prefer more info about the product.  I would def buy it again for cleaning.;neutral
The mac and cheese is fine, but the portion is very small and expensive for what you actually get. Kinda dry, too. I'll stick with the regular packages.;neutral
I normally eat Shin ramen, but decided too try Ottogi ramen for a change of pace. It is okay, but I prefer the taste of Shin ramen over this one. Both are hot, but the shin just seems to have a better flavor.;neutral
"Watch out. You may think this has no carbs. Very not true. It is less than other pastas but if you are doing low carbs....skip this..
If you are just lowering carb intake, this tasts great.";neutral
Had an acidic taste to me. It did ok at flavoring things, but I didn't think it was sweet enough. I wouldn't buy again.;neutral
"Good :waker-upper!"".....but not enough hazelnut flavor for me, so I mix with another Hazelnut brand & its perfect for a sluggish day! Love the pods better than k-cups!";neutral
I thought I would be wow'ed by this tea - it is good but not a wow - still, we will drink it - good for us!;neutral
Expected a little more bang for the buck.;neutral
Not quite as good as when they were USA made.  They are a little dry;neutral
Nut were good, but not enough for the price.;neutral
We prefer Bewley's but this doesn't suck.  Bewley's has more flavor IMHO.;neutral
Not like an energy drink buzz. Not really great flavor, but I like Choice products in general and they have an awesome Oolong;neutral
Did not care for the taste and smell of these. I have used another brand before and they did not have a smell or chemical taste. It still cleaned my teeth but I could only use 2 before I gave up on them.;neutral
mint wasn't strong enough, for me at least;neutral
A tasty bar and I like it. It is sweet,handy and easy to eat. However I believe it will put pounds on me which would be detrimental. If weight is no concern buy it.;neutral
Typical American licorice.  Lots of chopped pieces in the container.  Did not seem up to Red Vine standards.  Why can't we get good American made licorice anymore???????;neutral
Ok, but hardly worth the money. Taste is great. Not sure it provides much of a boost, thought;neutral
It was ok. I think I prefer brewing regular coffee and adding pumpkin spice creamer instead. I like San Francisco Bay's coffee's, they are all very good.;neutral
"Okay but would rather make from ""scratch""..
  Convenient.";neutral
Well, everybody knows what Jello stands for. The instant puddings are not the best, but you don't have to cook them. And there you have it.;neutral
bought it to help me with sleep, but I don't think it does anything. I have been taking nightly. The package came leaking a little bit too.;neutral
"Better than I expected and I couldn't be happier. Delicious and recommended.

Update- Second bag was stale and chewy. Hard to review when the quality is so inconsistent.";neutral
This is just OK... not a very strong sweet taste.  I find that about four packs of xylitol equal one pack of stevia.;neutral
Not that tasty. Filling though and they hold their shape nicely.;neutral
Not much to say about Lipton tea. It's basic and cheap, but if you're a tea lover, there are much better teas out there.;neutral
Box busted open large water setting on top of chips;neutral
great taste and texture but too much will give you gas.;neutral
I received my product exactly one stated I did not think the product was that good I thought it was a waste of money The Taste was terrible;neutral
This is just okay. I find it messy and hard to deal with. I prefer a more buttery taste too. Not sure how to get that. I think buying this stuff separate would be more preferable to me.;neutral
"I wish the packets were bigger. I guess I should have figured it out from the product dimensions listed here, but ah well.

I just wish they provided more chocolates for the price we're paying.";neutral
way too small for my liking.  had to add multiple packets;neutral
not quite as good a taste as the hawaiin brand. but a good snack. couldn't find locally in store.;neutral
It looks okey, and takes five days to receive it...I'll use it soon and hope it can work well..;neutral
It's OK, but not enough to make me a repeat customer. Still looking for that outstanding jerky.;neutral
Tried it in a smoothie and it was not good.;neutral
Good coke but not worth the time and money to order shipped;neutral
Many of these chips are light and crispy, but several in every bag have a soft, chewy texture like they are old. Jackson's Honest Sweet Potato Chips have a good flavor and just the right amount of sea salt.;neutral
NutterButter cookies used to be better.  The cookie part is good, but the filling has changed somehow and doesn't taste good.;neutral
Overall this candy has a pretty good licorice flavor but, the texture it oily and rubbery. Don't think I will buy it again.;neutral
Decent gum, but odd minty flavor.  I'm not a fan of the flavor.  It is hard convincing my patient's to chew it.;neutral
Is too runny, and jars are not even full !!!!!!;neutral
the product itself is healthy. but it is so dense that I nearly choked on it a number of times. Although the taste is excellent, it is almost dangerous to eat.;neutral
I purchased these cookies for my wife. She is an Oreo cookie aficionado. She thought the cookies were okay, not great.;neutral
Didn't like the really small packages - since I love chocolate so much, it would take 2 or 3 of these small packages to satisfy my chocolate craving, went thru the package rather quickly.;neutral
I have no complaints about the peanut butter (though I am not a big fan of their chunky), and I like the honey infused version, but it's just okay in my opinion. Not spectacular, not awful, just ok.;neutral
Went with the name and low price.  Coffee is mediocre with a slight muddy taste.  Great delivery service.;neutral
Product was excellent but the weight should have been stated.  Price is very high for the weight when compared to others right here on this web site.;neutral
These flavored my slow cooked pot roast, but I personally found them to be a bit strong.  Next time, I will not add the whole container without tasting first.;neutral
It's gross, but all protein powder is gross, sooo..... 3 stars!;neutral
I have tried other products that would pop every single kernel in my air popper- this one left a LOT of kernels behind, which is an issue when you are over 30 & actually have dental work.;neutral
decent enough product. A little too hard and crunchy for me. Hurt my mouth to chew them and the flavor is a little too pungent for me. But, if you like heavy flax flavor and you've got good teeth...go for it!;neutral
to crispy and cut the malitol for Splenda;neutral
overpriced IMHO.  I didn't grok the amount of weed here from the ounces listed.  The local Korean store sells 4 times as much for the same price.  My error in not reading and understanding .;neutral
I only really liked one of the flavors and the plain ones. 2 of the flavors were very mild.;neutral
These nuts leave my mouth and throat dry.  The chocolate coating is so thin, it's more of a dusting of cocoa powder.  They still taste good, but I'll buy regular almonds and a bar of chocolate next time.;neutral
I like good coffee and this coffee is just OK. Nothing wrong here but I do not put this coffee in the same league as Starbucks or other first grade coffee. I'll drink the bag but would not order again.;neutral
Not bad, but unless you have Celac what's the point?;neutral
Clumpy and hard to dissolve.  I think it was that way when I got it, and maybe it absorbed some additional moisture from the air, but it's difficult to dissolve this product in water.;neutral
No different than the stuff at my grocery.;neutral
They are hoooottttt but they don't really have a distinctive flavor. Well, except potato.;neutral
not our favorite of the DaVinci Sugar free line but it was good;neutral
feels cheap.  It only works when you point it directly at the receiver.  It's an ok replacement but definitely not as good as the original.;neutral
It had the right texture, but not the right taste. Halva is not made with corn syrup. ;neutral
Outrageously expensive and not that much better than other rice chips. I hope the price will fall into line.;neutral
"Prefer other brands to this for flavor-very ""bland flavor.";neutral
They taste ok--a little dry. Understand, though, they are not the size of an English muffin--more like the size of a cookie and are packaged like Little Debbie cakes. Definitely not worth the cost.;neutral
Bought these on the advise of a friend.  They are harder than shredded wheat!!  OK, if you like that sort of thing.;neutral
I like it but think it's very pricy;neutral
Way too sweet for me. But the flavor is nice. But really sweet. Comes with three pouches of two each.;neutral
At first I did not like these but after I got used to the fishy taste which overwhelmed me the first time I tried them, I found that I like them, I think that I will buy more.;neutral
I would be fine cooking with this but I don't think I'll drink it out of a glass.  I might try a lower fat version, it could be that I'm just not used to the butterfat.;neutral
taste ok but got alot of shell pieces in them, i even found a piece of wood.;neutral
good sticks, I am just coming down from a cold, that might be altering my taste a little. Not my favorite flavored teriyaki sticks but they're still good.;neutral
When I got my Cacao butter it had melted and was one big blob in the package!!!!!;neutral
They were old and did not taste the same as the ones purchased at the grocery store. They did not seem fresh.;neutral
"I will say the product was a bit of a let down, it does not have the flavor it states.
The delivery and customer service was great!";neutral
My last order was delicious! This one tastes slightly rancid to me. The expiration date is next year... will let the seller know;neutral
This crystallized ginger is just ok.  It's a bit too grainy/root textured and has too much sugar coating.  I've had better but this was effective at alleviating some 1st trimester morning sickness.;neutral
The taste is average.  The protein content seems higher than some competitiors.  Other flavors are better.;neutral
"These walnuts are better for cooking or added to oatmeal.  Eating them alone may be difficult for many people because of the ""earthy"" smell.";neutral
Unfortunately the pastries arrived stale... so they tasted off and they pastry was crumbly.;neutral
Overall, okay coffee...found that bulk beans tasted better....especially for the price and savings:);neutral
These are okay to pretty good, but not great.  My favorite crystallized ginger is by Penzey's spices, but it's 4 or 5 times as expensive as this.  Some pieces are very good, but others are pretty stringy.;neutral
but once you put them in something it is gone, so the are great for cooking but not if you want to put them on a salad or something like that.;neutral
So so. I was looking for an alternative to the Jasmine tea from Peet's Coffee, but this wasn't it. Oh well.;neutral
Decent coffee, smooth with rich flavor.  Medium bodied.  Not acidic or harsh.;neutral
"Made ""chile"" from the recipe on bag. Fair result, not a vegetarian, but trying new things out. No big deal.";neutral
"It taste good but the packet is very small and it is hard to get the harden Almond Butter out.
Not worth the money when you have to fight to get the butter to come out.";neutral
It is a pretty strong, nearly bitter dark chocolate. I will be trying it in recipes as eating it straight is a bit of a challenge.;neutral
Super small package. Barely makes 3 standard size pancakes. Best for eating by yourself or have eggs and bacon on the side to share these.;neutral
It's a bit to sweet for my taste though.  I like a bit less sweetness and there is no way to avoid it in this blend.;neutral
No peppermint flavor. Tastes more like burnt coffee. No chocolate flavor either. I'll just drink reg coffee inssteaqd of this.;neutral
"Meat was good, and delivery good, but price was for ""Gold"", not meat !!";neutral
Tastier now that they've added vanilla.;neutral
The package arrived with the lid cracked open.  The product itself is good. But the packaging was not.;neutral
I've only tried one so far but it writes green, not black.;neutral
It was alright, but to me has a weird aftertaste I didn't quite enjoy. Like a sweet, weird herb flavor of some sort, that just didn't go along with the turkey.;neutral
"pecans are great for baking and eating just so; unfortuately I thought these were salted and I was wrong; NOT SALTED.";neutral
Although I like a strong wintergreen flavor, this one is ok.  I don't like the strong peppermint flavors and this one isn't as intense as those.;neutral
Tasty and conveniently packaged, but was grainy compared to other brands.;neutral
just ok..they taste a little too artificially flavored for me..Dont know why they couldn't make them more naturally like with real sugar and salt..;neutral
I have never had Noni, neither fresh nor powder. This one tastes like dirt, so I use small amounts in my smoothies. Hopefully it still contains the nutrients the original fruit should have.;neutral
These cookies are good with coffee but a little pricey. Trader Joes seem to be a little too proud of their stuff!;neutral
Nothing special kinda like a dull orange flavor;neutral
These aren't bad, but they seem to always get smashed in delivery for us.;neutral
Great bean for nachos and enchiladas, consistent flavor;neutral
The matcha was high quality as advertised with no bitterness or astringency. I did receive the item in poor condition as the can was dented. That is the reason why I rated three stars.;neutral
They are ok...But I was looking for a thicker noodle.;neutral
Used for cold brew, didn't try with traditional coffee brewing. Not bold enough;neutral
Doesn't taste like Boston Cream. Their Chocolate Donut flavor is better. It didn't taste bad, but not the creaminess of a Boston Cream.;neutral
they tasted good, but we had an allergy to the berries.;neutral
I like my coffee stronger.  I didn't like the taste much;neutral
I was somewhat disappointed...some of the flavor were pretty good while other not so good...the 2 fruit flavors, I ended up throwing 1/2 the bag away of both..;neutral
This was fine but I was expecting a darker syrup, this seemed to be light;neutral
Its candy.  It tastes like candy.,,,  just a little stale.;neutral
The product is excellent. What I don't like is that the price increases gradually  Not cool;neutral
I got three instead of the four because for some reason one bottle for busted.;neutral
My daughter had given me a jar of this once and loved it in a bloody Mary. Had to mix it 1/2 and with 1/2 straight tomato juice. A bit pricey.;neutral
Tastes a little like dark roast than I thought it would.  It was just okay.;neutral
No as good as I had expected, the reason is wonderful!;neutral
Enjoyed it but without much enthusiasm.  I think there are better tasting coffee than this.;neutral
I found the prices at Keurig.com better than these prices.;neutral
The taste is good but, the seeds are very small.;neutral
Pretty good ones and some pretty average ones.;neutral
Contained caffeine ... so I was disappointed.;neutral
My husbands favorite coffee. It isn't stocked locally in k cups. It's over priced here compared to other k cups, hence the 3 star review.;neutral
Has great ingredients, but tasted quite bland.;neutral
Tastes okay, works well, just has a faint smell of play-doh.  Not as bad as Wilton fondant though.;neutral
They stick together, and the berries size are very small and broken.;neutral
"Many 'nuts' were empty -- no nuts... NUTS!
The plain lightly salted variety was much better and tastier too.";neutral
Good pretzels but came in small pieces.;neutral
okay, got the taste I was looking for.  It doesn't seem so fresh, or maybe it's because it's got too much coating.;neutral
This coffee is okay, but doesn't have the flavor I was hoping for.  I thought it would be like coffee from a donut shop, but it was not nearly as good.;neutral
The tea is very low quality. The leaves are stale, and the result is yellowish, muddy and ashy. Still drinkable, but not suitable to entertain the guests.;neutral
Flavor is what as expected. But god. Be prepared . some are like crunching into rocks.;neutral
It shows in a brown glass bottle but came in a clear plastic bottle.  Probably wouldn't have bought it if I knew it was plastic.;neutral
It was ok.  I don't think I will purchase this brand any more.  I usually really like Hormel products but just not this one.;neutral
I have always loved sour patch kids, but this batch seemed to be dryer then others I have had.;neutral
Don't understand why the Brits love PG tips. I didn't.;neutral
Does not have much of a cheesy flavor.;neutral
Sounds crazy, but they taste better out of the tin.  I do use these for my dry mouth and they refresh and no artificial crap!  I will continue to use, but will only order the tins;neutral
Good Miso, I find if I mix some Red with White Miso, It is a smoother, more authentic Japanese Miso Ramen. That opinion is completely subjective. You may prefer it straight-;neutral
I like this but wish it were of a finer grind.;neutral
"It arrived on time.
so far, I have not tried it yet....still in the package.
If it works out I will let you know.";neutral
I'm not terribly impressed with the flavor of this coffee. It's okay if you are into very subtle flavor but if you like a little stronger flavor in your flavored coffee I'd find another brand.;neutral
Still very edible, but these frozen mini-burgers aren't quite as thick and juicy as I recall from decades past.  Good balance of bread and cheese, and they heat up very well in just one minute of microwaving.;neutral
these took FOREVER to get here.... son can only eat the ones from England or Canada due to his peanut allergy.  They actually taste a little different from the ones here in the US;neutral
Hint of a plastic aftertaste to it. You get that will all of these flavorings, though. I think I most recommend McCormick, but wouldn't actively discourage anyone from purchasing this instead.;neutral
These figs are okay but aren't as big or as white as some others we have purchased.  They are tougher and seem a little on the dry side.  Would rebuy if others that taste better are not available.;neutral
The bag was opened when I received it in the mail.;neutral
Ive ordered quite a few of these mints. If I could use the word old or stale, that would fit this order. Very hard, don't have the same nice chewing experience.;neutral
they are okay. i prefer freeze dried bananas since they have more banana flavor. these are just kind of sweet and chewy without a lot of flavor.;neutral
Opened a can and found very little meat or veggies, mostly liquid! It did taste good but was mostly broth. I hope the other cans have more solid food product and less liquid.;neutral
Tastes like cardboard but got the kids into 'making a pizza.'  However, only a few months before expiration.  Would I buy again? Nah.;neutral
I used it twice, it burned both times. The corn that did pop were very small. I don't think I will be using it much anymore.;neutral
I love the Pure Leaf sweet tea, but was very disappointed in this. I've had raspberry ice tea at restaurants, but this just didn't taste well.;neutral
Twinings tea is SUPERB-this review is for the Chai decaf-I wasn't a fan of this tea due to a taste of black licorice that I felt was overpowering-to each her own though!;neutral
Not as flavorful as I was expecting...;neutral
This wasn't bad for coffee, but the flavor isn't very strong.  If you add enough sweetener, it brings up the flavor, but if you're not a fan of sweet coffee (like me), then it's maybe not the best choice.;neutral
These are good, but I like the other flavors better.;neutral
sausage was good but the cheese wasn't all that good. It would crumble when you tried to cut it. Also didn't care for the flavor of it. Will buy the sausage again but not the cheese.;neutral
great price however, I was not impressed with the texture. It reminded me of a military MRE;neutral
These are very fudgy. I personally like more spongy brownies so I wasn't too crazy about these. Would I buy them again? No, but thats just my personal taste.;neutral
Just OK. I like the Kay's naturals better in individual packs.;neutral
Other brands have less dry berries, but if you use them for cooking or soak them in water they're okay...;neutral
bought them for my son who liked the taste and it was a birthday gift. Saw the Brach's ad and wanted to try a new taste;neutral
I am sure its fine for some folks. Not to my taste.;neutral
Still just tastes like black coffee to me, but another person mentioned that it smelled good. I was hoping for a flavorful coffee, but I still had to add cream and sugar to it.;neutral
Overall, I think it's pretty good but we bought it for our 3 and 1 year old, both of who hate it. I think it tastes as good as other major brands.;neutral
Not quite as much punch as I like in a coffee but if you like medium roast than this is for you;neutral
Not as good as expected. Very little familiar Buffalo taste.;neutral
Fruity flavors, but not really that great. They're a bit bitter and bland, so I was a bit disappointed. I've had better.;neutral
Sweet enough but lacked the licorice flavor. I also ordered the Brach's black jelly eggs and the were much more flavorful. I also preferred the texture of the Brach's better. Not a complete waste though.;neutral
not my best choice of flavours. won't buy it again.;neutral
Product ok, but I can get it cheaper through my food distributer;neutral
Doesn't last long. If you get it, plan to cook it the same day.;neutral
Do not care for this at all. I didn't realize it was instant, and it's too finely ground -- gives it a pasty texture.  Wish I hadn't ordered 2 bags -- pooh.;neutral
Costly but the angel hair is the best I've tried out of several different noodle types.;neutral
I have this product on hand for consumption when my budget is strained. I eat them with a can of green beans. They're okay in a pinch.;neutral
I DID NOT LIKE THE FLAVOR OF THIS TEA. I FOUND IT TO BE BLAND COMPARED TO OTHER TWININGS TEAS;neutral
One cookie is actually two servings.  It is pretty high in calories and sugar and expensive for what you are getting.;neutral
they're okay, they don't taste very  anisey though. After they get eaten im not going to get any more;neutral
I much prefer the regular cream cheese, but it works when needed. Probably best to combine the powder with the real cream cheese.;neutral
As others mentioned, it's not great value for money but as a last minute gift, it did the trick. Comes loosely packaged inside a poly mailer. No box or anything. BEWARE the mango pack is super spicy.;neutral
Good taste and fresh, but overpriced.;neutral
Very yummy product, but tiny little bag. I could go to Costco and get a bag of mixed variety Lindt Lindor for double the price but 20x the amount I got in this tiny bag. Bummed!!!!;neutral
You've really got to not mind the taste of coconut.  You really don't need to use much which is good - but yeah it has a very strong coconut flavor.  I just wish it was organic.;neutral
Taste good if you can get them out of the packaging.  The individually wrapped candies are very difficult to open especially for older hands.;neutral
I felt the Tortilla Stuffers were a bit too spicy for my taste. My younger grandkids did not care for it, but the older ones ate it, and drank a lot of water.;neutral
This stuff is too course. Works better on food if you grind it further....;neutral
didn't see any diff, gave away to friend;neutral
Reasonable flavor for a K cup.  But it is hard to beat the flavor of a real brewed  cup of Kona coffee. Works well in my Real Cup coffee maker.;neutral
pricey and I find I prefer gruyere-asiago-and ricotta salada this was ok but I like gorgonzola much more and cost less;neutral
The grandchildren really enjoyed them;neutral
Not the best tasting Jerky, but made with all natural ingredients;neutral
I don't drink coffee, but I order it for my husband. He likes the taste of this coffee, not too bitter but it tends to clog his Keurig more than other K-Cup brands.;neutral
Dryer/harder than the Viva Labs Goji Berries (my fav brand so far, I've tried 4).  Maybe heat is used in the drying process as some berries taste burnt.;neutral
This cereal is too sweet for my taste.  I usually buy the Special K Red Berries but decided to give this one a try.  But it's too sweet, so back to Red Berries for me.;neutral
Very convenient and pretty good snack.;neutral
Picture on package does not represent quality of product.  The majority of the slices are in small pieces.  Seems as bag was filled with pieces that fell through the sorting screen at the factory.;neutral
not bad, not so great, not strained well. I prefer Kirkland at Costco, better aroma, taste and value.;neutral
I was disappointed with these figs, the taste is alright but the potassium sorbitol I do not like. I mostly use them as a snack.;neutral
My husband loves bold coffee, so I bought this for him.  My sister-in-law also had this coffee for her keurig.  Neither of them care for this coffee, but they will drink if they are out of their other stuff.;neutral
Pretty much like a cheese it with less flavor. A lot if them in the first bag were broken.;neutral
These were sent to me & the use by date is next month. Not enough time for a pack of 9!;neutral
Beans are good quality, but I like a light medium roast and roasted this way the flavor seemed bland even if used more eeans per cup..  I will roast the next a bit darker and see if that helps.;neutral
Some I liked better than others.  Pick the flavor you like and order that one next time;neutral
not a bad brew but the Kahlua flavor is faint so it's just ok. Probably would be great spiced up with some actual Kahlua.;neutral
Not the usual spin on tortilla soup, but a great alternative to high fat and sodium varieties.;neutral
The strawberries were a little more sour than I was wanting. Just not sweet enough for me and adding sugar didn't really help much. Was a little disappointed.;neutral
Not as flavorful as I like.  Seems to be a little bland for my taste  not as strong as I thought it would be.;neutral
Weak flavor and not thick as expected - but worked out well in the crockpot for a pork stew.;neutral
"These taste great - no contest. I got these for my husband instead of the toast-chee crackers; he noted that they're very salty. Sodium almost double.";neutral
I was expecting more of a minty flavor than this tea has.  I will not purchase this again.;neutral
The amount of cookies and the size of them were really good. However, the cookies were very stale;neutral
No better or worse than the other premium short grain rice I can get at the Asian Market.;neutral
its decent. nothing mind blowing...;neutral
Good quality brand, but haven't noticed any increased energy or positive effects after months of use. May help others, but I will not be continuing this as part of my vitamin/supplement routine.;neutral
Found it to be a bit too sweet. A jigger of VO helps a lot.;neutral
Thought caramel would be creamier and more apparent.  Good size bag for price.;neutral
"Flavor: 3 stars, tastes similar to Kraft caramels.
Price: Overpriced, could buy Kraft anywhere for less.
Stickiness: Did not stick to paper yet, but sticks to my teeth.
Summary: OK, but will not buy again.";neutral
If you want your pretzels VERY crisp, these are what you want. They were all busted to pieces upon arrival though. I prefer Snyders GF pretzels.;neutral
Tastes just like the original, but in a tiny jar, very expensive. It was a gift to bring back memories of days gone by.;neutral
It was okay but rather heavy for my liking.;neutral
"Flavor: Peanut Butter Crunch
This flavor is pretty good but to me it's very light on the peanut butter flavor. Wish it had more.";neutral
When it says Spiced Cider they aren't kidding.  It is a little to spicey for my taste, but I gave it to a friend to try.;neutral
Noodle too bland and didn't like noodle texture. Grilled Chicken and Sausage too spicy hot for me. Gave to brother in law loves heat!;neutral
I am not partial to these as I LOVE the drinks better!!;neutral
Not as great as the cinnamon raisin flavor, but something different.;neutral
didn't realize i would get tea with this. i should have read the description better. otherwise the coffees were ok, not great;neutral
As much as I like the bacon flavored salts....not too keen on this....just a regular mayonnaise girl.  Sorry, but not for me.;neutral
Small portion but good flavor. Not too salty which is often an issue and processed food.;neutral
It was ok but I thought a little pricey and I just did not care for the taste. It just was not for me;neutral
The taste was good, but it was not worth the price of the cake. I will not be buying another one.;neutral
split very easily and more pungent smell than other casings I've used in the past;neutral
Unfortunately this has a powdery consistency which does not dissolve in liquids (ie.  Hot Drinks) .  Works fine for cooking.;neutral
I love this snack but I find the packaging absolutely wasteful. When these arrived I ate 6 packs the same day. They are bulky to carry with you, unlike the flat 5 sheet they offer.;neutral
Nice change form the more popular KIND Bars, but not something I would buy too much of.;neutral
this is ok. i don't like red palm oil that much so it may be very good but it gives food i have made with it a very odd taste.;neutral
"I liked the chocolate.
I didn't like the pumpkin spice. it left an after taste.";neutral
My son loves these BUT they are full of caffeine so not a great healthy energy drink.;neutral
I didn't read ad properly and thought I was ordering pure stevia.;neutral
"Doesn't taste as good as the regular ""non-organic"" syrup.";neutral
"It's not as ""wow"" as the toffee Sweet Drops. Everyone here prefers the toffee and I don't know if this is going to get used up until we run out of the toffee.";neutral
these were pretty salty but once you get some of the salt off them they are great.;neutral
These bars are great, but in the package I received, they are all extremely hard and taste stale. The printed sell-by date isn't until May 2018, but these are far from fresh.;neutral
Not very good, has no authentic oriental 5 spice taste, disappointing.;neutral
Not nearly as flavored as expected.  Smells good but lacks a strong flavor, except coffee.;neutral
It works but there are better options that are offered through Amazon;neutral
Good buy but I like a little stronger blend of coffee.;neutral
Ok. Good for the price , although others are inexpensive as well but less salty w milder flavor;neutral
OK, but not my favorite flavor. I prefer the peanut butter/dark chocolate Nature Valley Chewy Granola Protein bars.;neutral
didn't care much for these.  Eight ounces would have way more than enough.;neutral
Not the best 100% kona, but they go on sale a lot, so I get them and mix them with better beans for a decent, but less expensive kona cup.;neutral
Love Vegemite!!! A bit pricy though for the small amount you are actually getting...;neutral
too much like soda pop. Better than Crystal light's orange flavor, though;neutral
Better taste than the brands offered at local grocery store, but pretzel is very hard.  Beware if you have crowns or other breakable dental work.;neutral
Too sweet and the sweetener used is Stevia which leave a bad after taste in your mouth.;neutral
Doesn't taste very chocolaty or caramely to me, but it's good breakfast coffee.;neutral
Lots of broken cookies, but they still are delicious.;neutral
Love it.  Though once or twice when I ordered it I wasn't happy because the expiration date was close by like a month away only;neutral
Not as cruntchy as I thought they would be.  Otherwise, good.;neutral
"Not as dark deep and flavorful as I like
tried ginding the beans differently but still
too mild for me";neutral
It's okay for creamers.  I personnally was not very happy with the mildness of it's flavor but if you are looking for a hint of flavor. This is a good purchase.;neutral
Not the greatest cup of coffee. I'd keep shopping, there are better tasting K cups out there.;neutral
This flavor is a little strong for me. It's okay for occasional drinking but I wouldn't want it everyday.;neutral
pretty good flavor but kind of tastes a little like fake sweetener. I like that it has caffeine, but i can just add instant coffee to my other fave protein for the same effect.;neutral
Its ok, sauce was a little spicy for me;neutral
"It'll do I suppose, but I wasn't a huge fan.
It may be the recipe that my wife used in order to create it but I wasn't blown away by it.
It is definitely not bad, but I probably won't be buying again.";neutral
super hot, but the flavor is just ok. If you leave it in the breakroom fridge, people will complain, but they really shouldn't be stealing your stuff anyway.;neutral
Taking a while to get used to it. Much better than plain water.;neutral
Most of their products are excellent.......these have good flavor but I prefer other candy in their line.  You won't go wrong in ordering these it's just my taste buds.;neutral
I drink a lot of coffee some leave a bad taste in your mouth that's what this does but thin again i don't drink folders just saying.;neutral
"I liked the pickle and spicy pickle but only use them on cottage cheese. I really hated the lime and cannot think of one earthly place I would use it.
So, I'm happy with 2 and the price was ok, so I am happy.";neutral
It's ok but has no flavor and don't think they can slice the bacon any thinner. But it has no Flavor;neutral
Not as good as Creme Savers, but close enough.;neutral
Its pretty good...nothing to really go postal about, average tasting nori. I think I prefer a much thicker nori sheet in order to make avocado+cucumber rolls;neutral
to bricks were opened or i should say air leaked;neutral
Not the good stuff but it is OK for frying/sauting. Not cold pressed? Off taste. Just try tasting it before you use it.;neutral
I think the flavor is good, but it just isn't as strong as I would like. I guess for the price, I cannot expect a hearty brew. If this brand ever gets a stronger blend, I will switch.;neutral
These have a good flavor and serve their purpose but they're a little on the dry side.;neutral
they were OK tasting...not sure if I would purchase them again or not..;neutral
first 2  of 3 orders orders were  so tasty with no graininess  and just perfect, last order of the 3 was grainy and  the taste was not good at all.;neutral
excellent bbq spice, nice quality peanuts.  i would buy these against except for the price and the canola oil.;neutral
There were a bunch of random items in here. Good if you just want to try some odd candy items. Not recommended if you are searching for the more popular items.;neutral
only tastes okay in smoothies, ruins the flavor of anything else. if you want high doses of vit c get sodium ascorbate or aa. Probably won't buy again.;neutral
I love the chips but so far root beer is my fav;neutral
I could do without the tomatoes.  Other than that, great!;neutral
"It states it should be refrigerated on the packaging.  Not just ""refrigerate after opening"" but ""keep refrigerated"".  Not sure if I can use it!";neutral
My fear was that these snacks were going to be bland and dry.  In fact they are decent....Not too salty or overly spiced.  A great protein snack!  Would definitely buy more flavors.;neutral
sorry , my taste buds were disappointed and not impressed.;neutral
I was really looking for something with more punch to it. Even though I have used it several times on pizza, I can only barely paste the spice. It seems to work better when used after your food is cooked.;neutral
Expected more tea flavor.  I felt flavor a little weak.;neutral
Good flavored coffee but not so much Kona. I got spoiled in Hawaii drinking real Kona coffee so this blend isn't Kona enough to satisify tast for Kona.;neutral
These are handy if you are trying to low-carb and miss your pasta fix. They aren't exactly like traditional pasta, naturally, but for us they do fill the void.;neutral
Good but the flavor is just a little something I don't love. I would drink it if it was my only option but probably wouldn't order again. But I'm not into most caramel ish coffee flavors.;neutral
"Most of the pieces arrived broken and I had to ""glue"" them back together with icing.  If not for that, I liked them and they looked cute on the cupcakes I made for the baby shower.";neutral
The rockstar was ok but it was all banged up when I recieved it.;neutral
nice texture, not great flavor - just ok;neutral
This was a pleasant change from our regular coffee. That said, it isn't one that I would want to drink every day.;neutral
Comes in a plastic container smashed. Not lose like in the picture.;neutral
Very good when you need a decaf and not sacrifice taste.;neutral
These weren't awful, but I did notice that they weren't quite as flavorful as other brands. Not worth the price to buy it again.;neutral
This was okay, not our favorite.  There aren't many included for the price, but the packaging delivered.;neutral
I used this for a course as practice icing, and then for a set of cupcakes I made for a friend.  The reviews were that the icing was too sweet.  It was great to use for practice though.;neutral
and not such a good smell did try tyson was way better would not order it again , just wished to get more dark meat chicken with low sodium;neutral
Nuts are OK. Realize I like them better roasted and salted - just a peasant I guess.;neutral
These are good. And even though it's not that many I won't be finishing them in a day;neutral
Not too bad - would have preferred more coconut flavor - not sure this stand out from other drinks though. Good price.;neutral
it was just ok. I want to try it hot, with milk.;neutral
Not as much flavor as expected.  Tastes like coco with only a slight taste of the flavor noted on the 7 different boxes.;neutral
My favorite dessert flavor and makes a great tart.;neutral
The flavor is acceptable, but the chicken flavor tastes better to me.  My next purchase will be the chicken flavor.;neutral
Good quality but WAY over priced. The container is very small and over priced. You can buy this at your local Walmart for half the price and double the size;neutral
I did not know this was flavored coffee, I don't really like flavored coffee but this was better than average!;neutral
Be careful when you open this. The kid was not secured and it went all over my kitchen floor.;neutral
This is a gift for someone else and do not know if this was good or not.;neutral
Again , I have had better tasting hazelnut, Has a smokey burnt cork taste. Nutty flavored for sure , but not the hazelnut taste I am looking for, but in all a good robust taste.;neutral
useful, good taste, long shelf life;neutral
Lots of broken pieces in the bag. After buying I figured out the price per ounce and it is actually cheaper to buy smaller bags at Wal-Mart.;neutral
Did not receive 5 boxes only 4 in box with everything else.;neutral
We thought it was OK. It was very fresh, but the flavor tended toward bitter.;neutral
"Great in store bought sauce (Gravy) to ""kick it up"" a little.  Not hot mind you, just a little extra flavor that bottle sauce often lacks!";neutral
good vanilla and spice flavors, but super sweet;neutral
Need to get used to taste and sort of hard to mix by hand or in shaker.  Also really didn't notice any health change??;neutral
Wouldn't pop like popcorn.  Have yet to use them for anything else.;neutral
A little too sweet for my taste, but otherwise this is a good matcha drink mix;neutral
Okay product up for coffee enemas I much prefer one of the dark strong organic coffees, much better buying value on Amazon and I found the coffee grinds in this product not as fresh as others;neutral
Not my favorite mint tea. Not a bad Tea either . Mighty leaf makes good products this just wasn't my favorite mint tea;neutral
Great candy just like we remember but a little on the stale side!;neutral
I can't seem to decide if I like this flavor or not.  It seems to leave a strange taste in my mouth.  It is not something I love, but I won't throw it away either so I'll give it 3 stars.;neutral
Very sweet and not sure of the quality of the protein. The ingredients look very good but just doesn't seem to do it for me, not a huge fan of the taste.;neutral
I bought this with my coffee maker because I didn't yet know what I'd like. I didn't realize it was so light. If you like a light coffee this might be for you, but I prefer a stronger blend.;neutral
This is a good product.  Starbuck's sugar free is better and I really want to find something organic next, but it's okay.;neutral
Not soft- hard to chew- tasted old-;neutral
This soup is ok.  It's spicy, which I like, but I don't care for the noodles very much, too gummy and not flavorful.  It works for a quick meal.;neutral
Probably wouldn't get it again. It's just okay for the price.;neutral
Nice blend of spices but I'm guessing it's not fresh because I didn't get a lot of flavor from it.;neutral
This flavor is pretty good, better than the chocolate and vanilla, but don't like that it has sucralose as the sweetener. Why can't these products use a raw natural sugar like monk fruit?;neutral
Doesn't taste like milk regardless of the way I mixed it.;neutral
I got the wrong maxwell house. I wanted the breakfast blend. It was me not the coffee.;neutral
Great price but tastes too much like added vitamin C at least in the mango flavor.  I didn't try the others.;neutral
"You just don't get enough for the price, it's just not fair!!
I don't want to make monthly payments on a snack loan, geez.";neutral
The crystals are pretty large, I wish they were smaller so that we could just use it on our everyday food, the flavor is good though, but I don't know how to crush it down to use it.;neutral
Good caffeine but too sweet! Oh well, I'll definitely drink them...wish they were a bit drier, as well as perhaps more ginger flavor :);neutral
Read the description print close! Some pieces in this assortment are only single bite size candies or snacks! Sort of disappointing!;neutral
Kids prefer Trader Joe's brand, but this is ok.  A bit oily;neutral
I'm more of a chocolate-holic and prefer the chocolate cappuccino much more.  the taste is very good but when I want chocolate, I want chocolate.....;neutral
I would love to find a tea that has more Orange flavor.  This was a better tea so far from what I have bought in the past.  I just wish there was more flavor.;neutral
Love this sweetener! But, the price is too high. Will buy more if price comes down.;neutral
I love a strong cup of coffee. This coffee isn't so much bold as bitter. Not going to order again.;neutral
Was excited but its just ok. Makes my throat kind if irritated for a moment after I swallow.;neutral
Its the only product that is completely lactose free it separates which is not the best but it's the only one I can use I haven't had any of my yogurts turn out perfectly with this product which disappointing;neutral
Meh. Not lots of flavor, just okay.;neutral
Good Morning Coffee... I like the flavor;neutral
Quality of the beans is fair. What they are doing is mixing quality beans with junk quality beans.;neutral
The texture is strange, so I empty it out and whisked it around and retuned to jar and that made it a lot easier to use, taste is not to bad will probably order this again..;neutral
I was disappointed in these. The flavor is so light that it doesn't really flavor the meal much at all.;neutral
It says organic and extra virgin but it isn't green and doesn't taste rich.;neutral
Inexpensive blue corn, could use a bit more salt.  Good with dips or as nachos but not fantastic as a stand alone snack.;neutral
"Husband hated the taste; adding flaxseed gives an ""off"" taste; not worth it";neutral
Not spicy enough too sweet and it is too sweet for me it's for ones who don't like too much hot but in a ginger candy I like really hot can't seem find any that is just that spicy.;neutral
Great flavor, but gets tough too quickly. I like that there's no aspartame in it and the purported benefits of xylitol are a nice bonus. But I won't get more of this.;neutral
Bought this on the recommendation of my son.  Not a big fan of flavored coffee, but a cup a day of this lightly flavored coconut coffee puts me in the islands.  How can you go wrong with Wolfgang Puck?;neutral
Took 4-6 days in a paper bag to get them ripe. But once they were they were delicious.;neutral
These don't taste all that great, but I can get them down.;neutral
Very mild taste. I know it is pure almond paste, but I prefer the sweetened ones better.;neutral
some of it is crumbly causing waste;neutral
"As noted by a prior reviewer, these arrived a bit old. While they're still edible, I won't purchase any more from Amazon; rather I'll go to Trader Joe's for fresher nuts.";neutral
Tastes good, easy to prepare, but a little salty for my taste.  Before heating, I rinse the packet contents a couple of times with water.  This helps a bit.;neutral
its ok, a little bitter for my taste;neutral
Better than some others I have tried.  The different colors actually taste differently, but they are too tart.  Close to the original English ones, but not there.;neutral
As with all meats today, these jerkiest were really to salty for me and I do not think I will be buying them again.;neutral
Theres seem to be more gummy then taste? Comparing to a regular bag I buy from a story it truly does seem like they put lesser flavor in the 5 pound bag;neutral
Soft light flavor I like stronger flavor;neutral
Very little lemon flavor. Quite disappointed.;neutral
Not as good as the dark chocolate. Next time I'll be getting dark chocolate.  These are stale tasting.;neutral
It's not my favorite hot sauce, but it does the job.;neutral
Just OK, would i purchase again, probably not.;neutral
It's not bad... just not as good as some I've tried. I do use it for lattes (in my organic vanilla soy milk), which is good.;neutral
Not the best instant ramen I've had from this company.  I prefer other flavors.;neutral
Love this stuff, but the two pack arrived with one of the caps completely broken (still sealed by the glued cover).  Now I have to remember to save the cap from the good jar before tossing it.;neutral
It's okay..but too highly priced really..;neutral
Tried this brand out for a different taste on my morning coffee. Didn't like this brand as much.;neutral
Be sure you like cinnamon becuause it's very, very strong.  I had to cut this with other Kellogg's cereal to make it edible.;neutral
not very exciting, a bit too greasy.;neutral
"Taste is fine, but a bit lumpy.
Still with my aversion to GMO's good enough.  Would buy again.";neutral
This was a Christmas gift and not tried it myself.  Had no report from the recepient.;neutral
Everything about the item works as advertised. I just don't particularly care for the flavor;neutral
The mango flavor was hard to detect but the tea was okay. I would rather have a stronger mango taste but it is good in a pinch. I did not reorder it and did not finish the box.;neutral
I did not realize it has a sugar alcohol . I wil just eat half a day so it does not hurt my guts. I have seen bars with three times that amount of the lalcohols. It has mild  taste  which Ilike.;neutral
Bland, texture is mushy, very little cherry flavor.  Adequate but will not purchase again.;neutral
"this stuff is unexpectedly good but has limited use; not what one would think of as salsa but as a mexican sauce it works";neutral
I like the jerky but, as others have commented, this is for one bag not four.;neutral
These taste great, but they are not healthy as was my impression. They are lower in calories, but still an empty snack.;neutral
"From reading the reviews I was expecting a better product than this. To me it is just average and I won't be ordering again........

PHRED05";neutral
Coffee is a good, nondescript flavor. Nothing to write home about, but not bad either. The price is a bit high in my opinion, but all these pod coffees are insane compared to a bag of ground coffee.;neutral
I had heard about this for a long time.  It is okay, but nothing to write home about.  I guess it is one of those things that you need to have good childhood memories about.;neutral
I used to love this tea but ...this seems a bit too strong for me!  Likely my taste has changed.;neutral
My husband and I don't like the aftertaste of splenda. Try wheylow as a great substitute, especially for baking. Truvia is also great.;neutral
This is a great spice to have but you need to crush it finely so you don't chew on the pods.;neutral
Planters has been a good choice for nuts but, I'm looking for healthier oils or better yet dry roasted nuts with sea salt only.;neutral
Great flavor, but literally lasts 15-30 seconds.  Turns out to be very expensive given how frequently you need to swap them out!;neutral
I really liked this gum because it doesn't have aspartame in it but it didn't last long enough.  I would like flavor to last longer.;neutral
Gah. That is a LOT of filling. Would type more but the sugar rush has given me shaky fingers.;neutral
The teas taste great, but I felt mislead. I searched for organic tea bags and this was one of the first that came up. Only some are organic, not all.;neutral
I didn't like it as well as other coffees I have purchased in the past.  It seemed less flavorful...maybe a little bitter.;neutral
I was kind of disappointed.  It is sweeter than WalMart's but about the same consistency.;neutral
I used to LOVE their lemon bars. These, however, are not the same as I remember. The taste is so-so and the bars seem smaller. I won't buy again.;neutral
I don't know about it.  Something I just wanted to try but I am not really impressed.;neutral
Need two or more for that real good chocolate taste.;neutral
"I like the flavor it imparts; however, when you follow package direction on how much water to use it was way too salty.  I had to double up on water.";neutral
Didn't mix well  Bland taste for my liking;neutral
"i really like how it tastes ""cool"" like cold, in my mouth, very refreshing, but it only lasts a few minutes :((.";neutral
The teriyaki flavor stick is softer and feels mushy compared to the Sweet and Spicy flavor but the nutritional panel still makes this a winner if you want a quick snack that's not too bad.;neutral
I thought the texture was fine but they did not have much flavor.;neutral
The colors are too light - not pigmented enough and didn't mix well with the Wilton lemon extract.;neutral
Does not stick to the corn all that well, hard to get flavor and doesn't really taste like butter - not even the fake movie theater kind.  But it's not awful.  Just wish I hadn't bought so much.;neutral
Healthy so that's a plus but I didn't taste any flavoring. If you like plain popcorn then these are fine but it wasn't what I was expecting.;neutral
Doesn't taste the best but it's really fun to play with!;neutral
I didn't like the flavor, but my husband didn't mind it. Neither of us loved it enough to want to buy it again.;neutral
Not super flavorful, so I add honey nut Cheerios;neutral
Delicious flavor but very short lived. Very expensive gum also.;neutral
has good flavor, I can't say it doesn't, but just go buy some ham at the deli. No differant;neutral
Not as flavorful as some Chili Powders but the price was good.;neutral
"Quite strong, even for a medium roast; not unusual though for Starbucks.";neutral
I like this mix, but WOW were they salty!;neutral
Very strange taste, almost as if its hazelnut. Not the same as the original Lively Up Coffee;neutral
"I guess it's a matter of taste.  For me...it is just o.k.  IT is very pricey and from the reviews, I could hardly wait for it to arrive.
Not rich enough for me...glad I tried it.";neutral
This makes a really nice homemade tortilla and the flavor is so much more tasty than store bought.  Would be nice if there was non-gmo masa available.;neutral
Nothing special, it is an okay cheap alternative to nespresso, but you get what you pay for, it has a quite watery taste;neutral
I really like Bai Bubbles much better....but these are tasty and are definitely a healthier choice than most others.;neutral
Yummy.  But the price is simply too high for these, so I probably won't reorder.;neutral
It's alright, for the price I know I could get better name brand coffee. I wouldn't buy again, but I did use all of the pods.;neutral
The taste was good, I just do not know that it was worth the cost.;neutral
Different product delivered than pictured.  Tastes different.  Wouldn't buy again.;neutral
this is really strong coffee for me but my husband loves this coffee so i will be buying more in the future;neutral
OK but doesn't taste much like chocolate.  It isn't bad tasting, just a bit disappointing.;neutral
The new prices on Moini make this oil seem like less of a value.;neutral
It was a little bit too strong for me though I usually like bold, strong , coffees. I couldn't get it to lighten easily with my creamer...;neutral
About average for the green teas I have tried. Slightly bitter, but that's almost expected for green teas.;neutral
"I love some of the Blue Sky stevia sodas but this one is a little odd.  If I didn't know what flavor it was, I don't think I would have guessed ""lemonade"".";neutral
It was ok but I wasn't overly keen on the taste and I won't buy again.;neutral
Unless you do a lot of baking, do you really need this much vanilla...I am afraid it will expire before I use this much.;neutral
Like the tea but it took a long time for delivery.;neutral
I only purchased these when our Sam's Club stopped selling a similar product, although larger & better quality. Had I noticed that they were an Eqyptian product, I would not have selected them.;neutral
Kind of tasty but didn't help my daughter at all.;neutral
Not my favorite. It is really bland compared to other jerkys but the texture is good.;neutral
Great bc all natural but flavor runs out twitching a minute and makes mouth dry.;neutral
I guess I was looking for something with more in the package.  It was ok  I probably won't try them again.;neutral
Banana flavoring should be sweet. This has a bitter taste, that only resembles banana. At such a high price, I expected better;neutral
This is just too bitter for me. I rate it three stars instead of one because my tastes may be different. Also it's a large bottle;neutral
Good quality tuna and packaged well to prevent damage to cans;neutral
I don't make enough dishes to use this in but the one I did was good. Came sealed but the lid was cracked but it didn't leak or anything so I used it anyway.;neutral
Well, if you're looking for a low calorie, low sugar, healthy snack then this will fit the bill.  Not the best tasting snack but a good fill in while at the golf course or between meals.;neutral
Very tasty but my wife got on my case for the price. Apparent in-store is much cheaper.;neutral
The beef stick is exactly what I wanted, spicy meat grease product.  The cheese though tasted like something used in those run flat tires.;neutral
I bought to improve the taste of smoothies.  It did not make as big an improvement as I had hoped.  My expectations could have been off but adding more Ginger or Cinnamon makes a bigger difference.;neutral
The product is what it is and at a good price. However, only Three stars b/c of the time of year. DO NOT order chocolate through the mail in warm weather, lol. Most is still edible but obv deformed.;neutral
This would be much better if it had a touch of cinnamon in it;neutral
It was ok but not worth it for me to pay shipping.;neutral
"Fresh but much saltier than I remember in years past.
All good ingredients, nothing artificial.";neutral
eay to use, but not as much flavor as fresh;neutral
Some of these cups won't work with my keurig. It's like the water won't go through the cup. Amazing flavor though for the ones that work!;neutral
Too salty. It provides the right texture to the ragout but it's too salty and smoky. Did better second time I tried it after blanching.;neutral
I  can't compare product since I've never tried garlic juice before.  Nice aroma;neutral
tastes like mochi, nice and fresh but not the very best.;neutral
This container seems to keep the peanuts fresh and crisp to the taste;neutral
Buyer beware: there are phosphates in these.;neutral
The milk fat tends to clump on the bottom. I like the taste and convenience. I keep some on hand for those times when we run out of fresh milk.;neutral
Simply OK.  Average tasting coffee.  Not up to good restaurant coffee (and I own a fairly decent brewing machine).;neutral
"Chia Chia!!
I don't feel no chia in me while having this!
I don't feel anything. No difference.. No relief. Nothing!";neutral
they did their job for me--keeping me away from other snacks that weren't healthy-if your on a weight loss program these are good to have on hand for the snack mode you get;neutral
Don't expect this to taste like Jiffy or store bought peanut butter. It doesn't taste bad at all, it takes time for your taste buds to get used to the difference. It is also runnier than store bought,;neutral
I have tried several of these coffees and this one is not what I expected. I still like the French roast.;neutral
These are yummy, but they do not open easily and have no way to close them in order to keep them fresh.;neutral
I still have the tea in my pantry. I don' t care for it very much. I would not buy it again. I probably will have to throw the box away.;neutral
Should have ordered the variety that comes with salt. This tastes like Crisco.;neutral
They are just what they say they are but I have read it is better to buy the seeds themselves.  Then you have to grind them.;neutral
Five of the first six we tried we just didn't like and we didn't finishing drinking. Rest of the order was very good and I guess this is a good way to see what you do and don't like.;neutral
"dr. belive  that  any one has thyroid problem . soy product should not advisable .  we have to find out other source for protein

contain food .";neutral
The coffee does not taste great like it used to.;neutral
I am not crazy about the taste of this. Tropicana is one of my favorites but it it taste better out of the 64oz size. Must be the plastic bottle.;neutral
Different...I won't purchase for us again. Some people may love it but not for us.;neutral
It is very small. Works for a pickle jar but you don't want to use it to move items in a big pot of soup to a blender. Very small;neutral
Smells a bit funky, like bathroom funky. I've noticed a few honeys that smelled like this and people have told me it's normal and not normal depending on the type of flowers the bees went to. Tastes okay.;neutral
I would have accepted it even if it was melted because I could have cut it in squares myself;neutral
One of the reviews said it was better than Starbucks. I did not agree, it was not as darkly roasted as I prefer. It was just okay to me.;neutral
"Definitely a cheap gluten free product. Good for food storage, but I'd never use it for everyday use.
Very refined, pretty bland.";neutral
This is one of the 1st teas from this Co. that I've not been impressed with. Could just be a personal preference but seems to be somewhat sour and bitter too me. Will not purchase again.;neutral
Nothing deli deluxe about it. I probably will not buy it again.;neutral
These are fairly good sized goji berries but they are dry. I buy them for my chinchillas so they don't care. If these were for myself, I would not be happy.;neutral
I like the spray, but the mints are a little strong for me.  But I had stage 4 cancer of the throat and mouth.;neutral
It was just okay-expecting more chocolate taste.  It wasn't really bad, but just not what I expected with the name Mudslide.;neutral
Too much salt/garlic ratio and wish the grinder was adjustable.;neutral
definitely, i prefer the ones that comes on a can ready to drink, carbonation makes the difference will not buy it again;neutral
Didn't like the flavor of these at all.;neutral
Kind of gross alone. You deifnitley need agave nectar/chia seeds or something along with it. does work as intended however.;neutral
Grainy texture. Normal flavor taste.;neutral
I love these macaroon crunch bars, but they crumble really easily and make a mess. I'd rate them higher if it weren't for the mess they make. They taste good and my family loves them.;neutral
Thought it might be different, more robust or something, than the regular ground Folgers. I was disappointed.;neutral
They weren't expired, but they were hard when they came rather than the soft texture you would expect.;neutral
We got this free on an order and I'm sure it will be quite nice as I have liked other Barilla pastas.;neutral
Flavor was ok but unlike boxes I have bought locally (I live in the Old Dominion), the pieces in this box were stuck together so well it was like they were glued.;neutral
Some recipes just didn't turn out the same using this verses the regular mix.;neutral
"Taste sweeter than a few years ago. Did the recipe change or am I just getting old?

3 stars. Why add extra sugar?";neutral
Not as good as expected. Still descent.;neutral
I buy these bars frequently at whole foods and love them. With this order, all the bars tasted bizarre and unfortunately they have been sitting in my pantry;neutral
Not terrible has a weird taste at first then it grows on you there's better flavors;neutral
Could be good if it had more filling.  Very dry!;neutral
"it is ready for topping

no need to put in fridge

but it is not that good taste

a little chewy

it needs improvement";neutral
JUST O.K. AS I found this oil to not be fresh as other brands i've purchased - now i have a whole 2 liters to use.;neutral
Quaker, Oatmeal To Go, Brown Sugar Cinnamon Breakfast Bars, 6-Count Boxes... when the product is from quaker it's tasty, however the texture is not for me.;neutral
Love the taste but doesn't help curb my appetite and they are way too expensive. I do love Chocolite products though, wish they were not so expensive!;neutral
Very tasty but very high in sodium.;neutral
A little expensive. Have learned I can do my own preserved Organic lemons easily at a minimal cost.;neutral
Just buy the packets and make hot water. Just as easy, and tastes so so so much better. But, if you like weak chocolate go for these.;neutral
I didn't use it so gave it away.  Don't know much else about it.  I should have gotten a single color.;neutral
These were eaten last out of the candy dish, not as good as other caramel apple lollipops.;neutral
Good but I've had them for over six months and have not used all of them. If they were great they would be gone lol. They are on the small side. I will stick with rice paper instead;neutral
very good, but expensive for such a small amount.;neutral
"They are a bit hard. I figured due to hot weather in transporation here. I find this on most I order containing flour and baked goods.
Has a great taste and goes with most dips or snacks";neutral
I don't care much for the flavored coffees ...........(except the french  vanilla.);neutral
Notice, like I did not, that this is 1 little oz. of olives. If you need the individual serving and can pay a buck and a quarter for it, this is the right product.;neutral
Not enough for the price.  Won't order again.;neutral
Small container. Picture is misleading. Much cheaper at grocery store.;neutral
Nothing special.  I've had other ghees which tasted better.  Wasn't impressed with this brand.;neutral
I have ordered Planters honey roasted cashews for over a decade. I swear they are more salty than they were years ago.;neutral
The reason I gave it a 3 stars, I feel the rose flavor has a bit of an after taste, maybe a little too strong for my taste.  It is still a nice tea.;neutral
There is no doubt that this is not sugar. I've used it in tea and one packet sweetens a huge mug of it just fine. If you want to be sugar free you just get used to it I guess.;neutral
It's a healthy snack but I'm looking for an organic replacement;neutral
it wasn't what I was looking for...just to much of a bite from the ginger...OK, but not for me...;neutral
use sparingly or you will have a dry and banana tasting product.;neutral
This procduct is very convenient and tastes good.  The tea is very sweet and flavorful.  I love being able to push a button and have it delivered to my door in just a couple of days.;neutral
This kind of tastes like gross goop but it hydrates you, I guess.;neutral
These were pretty good but not as good or as fresh as Mauna Loa.  Tasted kind of stale and chocolate very dry, not smooth.;neutral
It's not what I thought it was when I ordered it. I'm sure someone else may like them just fine, the taste is just not to my liking.;neutral
This is the second time I've order.  The reason I give 3 stars is because this time the expiry date only got 6 months.  Expiry date too short.  But this is good for making tiramisu.;neutral
I bought these soups for my husband. But he thinks the soup is too spicy. So he uses much less of the base but it's still too spicy. He will finish this pack but will not buy again.;neutral
Great chocolate. But way too much of it for one tiny coffee bean.;neutral
Too many peanuts and peanut butter crackers. Wont order again.;neutral
CHEMICALS ADDED TO DOUGH......NOT REAL;neutral
It smelled funky. I tossed it. Best to make your own.;neutral
"Found out that the market across the street from me carry these.
After eating 20 packets, I really don't want to see them again.";neutral
Not as tasty as pop tarts.  Crust too hard;neutral
The Vanilla isn't particularly strong, there's only the slightest of hints.  I prefer other teas I've had before where you can really smell / taste the aroma of the vanilla beans, but it's not a bad tea.;neutral
this PB is runny at Hawaii's 80 room temp, so had to put it in the fridge to firm it up.  Tastes OK, but I prefer Costco's organic PB, or best but more expensive Safeway's O brand.;neutral
Tasty, but the strawberry tastes better.;neutral
They were all salty varieties, but not bad other than that. At $6.99, this is not a bad value for a 24 pack.;neutral
This product is basically mashed potatoes and gravy with very tiny pieces of beef.  Flavor is ok but pieces of meet are so small.;neutral
"not what I expected ... the lightest cup of java I ever had
Taste is decent but nothing to right home about
Smell is GOOD ... Pumpkin Spice .....
would I buy it again ....no";neutral
It seem to be a good starter but doesn't have a strong sourdough scent;neutral
"It was ok, just didn't love the taste like I thought I would! Contacted the seller and they were great to understand and refund me!
Thank you,
Dierdre Aguilar";neutral
It came in a two pack, But very dusty. I haven't eaten it yet, But I hope it tastes good, As it did when I last had it.;neutral
I think i didn't get a very good batch considering theyll expire soon and every bag only has half the kernels popped.;neutral
I don't like this much. It's too bitter. I need to find ways to use it, because I hate wasting my money.;neutral
We didn't think it tasted like cola very much at all & was too sweet but we gave it all away to some one who really loved it.;neutral
Switched to Swansons brand. It is cheaper and I think better.;neutral
great tasting, but received a few dented cans. I disposed of them. afraid to eat.;neutral
Okay, but not great in my honest opinion.  Has a little bitter taste so you need to sweeten the coffee to make it enjoyable.  Probably wouldn't purchase again.;neutral
It's very good, but it has a slightly bitter taste. If you enjoy Starbucks Coffee you'll probably like this one.;neutral
My bad for not checking ingredients. I incorrectly assumed Madagascar Vanilla Bean Paste would be a pure product without added sugar. It is not.;neutral
This variety pack is a good way to try the different flavours.  Make note which ones you like if you plan to buy again. Reasonable price but I'm sticking to my favorite Nespesso.;neutral
Eh. Not nearly as good as I was expecting. Average for hot chocolate in general, below average for specialty hot chocolate and too expensive given the fact that it's nothing special;neutral
These were not as sweet as I expected, I am disappointed and won't buy this brand again.;neutral
Seasoned well.  Popular at our house.;neutral
It is alright.  Nothing Special!  However, once I became used to its texture it grew on my tastebuds.;neutral
Perfectly nice salt, and I'll use it up, but it's barely distinguishable from ordinary, non flavored salt. The Casina brand has much better truffle flavor.;neutral
I love peaches and granola with brown sugar but I don't love this. It has a funny and peculiar taste to it. My wife and I cannot figure out what makes it taste so odd. Cannot recommend.;neutral
"Updated review: the quality is not stable, the second batch I've got it simply horrible...

Just lovely! One of the best coffee I've got.";neutral
These were too salty for their intended use;neutral
This is a good product, but it's way overpriced. We have the best canned tomatoes in the world here in the USA, so there's really not reason to import these from Italy.;neutral
were not transfer sheets so hard to work with but otherwise, size was good and all that.;neutral
"The roasted flavor is wonderful.  Now if we could convince them to
not put in as much salt---they would be better---and I'm a salt lover--so it is too much.";neutral
They are delicious but I have to give it three stars instead of five because of the hike in price.;neutral
These are yummy, but definitely not worth more than $5 for the pack of 4. I've paid up to $8 for these. Definitely not worth that price tag;neutral
generally I find most Jack links products very good, this item left a little to be desired.;neutral
These are okay, but I can use old-fashioned oats on Fast Metabolism Diet, so I won't be buying these again.;neutral
Love their cookies but prefer the ginger snaps.. this has a funny texture;neutral
The Kahlua flavor is good, but the coffee flavor needs to be stronger.  If the coffee was bold, this coffee would be great!;neutral
It's okay popcorn. I've had better. I use it in the Air-Popper machine and it works fine. I'd recommend it only if you like air-popped popcorn.;neutral
Don't buy Hawaiian punch if you have kids.  I'm forever cleaning up the counters.  I don't like red drinks for kids, I bought it because it was a good price, but I won't buy again.;neutral
This popcorn tastes healthy.  The upside is that it is extremely healthy for you.  I recommend adding your own sea salt or other seasoning to enhance the taste a little.;neutral
Actually tastes more like spice cake than carrot cake, but they are okay.;neutral
I was a little disappointed with the flavor of these. I really tasted no salted caramel at all. Won't buy them again. I usually like all of the Pepperidge Farm cookies but not this one.;neutral
I've love Annie Chun's products for a very long time, but this one I didn't like as much.;neutral
The flavor is not as pronounced as I expected, but this definitely added character to the soup. I will keep looking for the best Tom Yum paste, but this one is decent.;neutral
Tend to all taste the same to me but it is soft, sweetly honeyed, and nutritious;neutral
It was alright but too soft despite following all instructions on the wrapper. It was about 5 stars way better than KaMe noodles yuck.;neutral
the product is good flavor and all . but there are other chocolate drinks for a lot less $$$ for the same flavor;neutral
product was good, but I broke a molar trying to bite, better bring a hammer and cheiieel;neutral
This drink tastes better to me than Ensure and is 11 oz. instead of 7.  It is also higher in protein content.  Makes a satisfying meal replacement.;neutral
SOme where damaged I would like replacemet;neutral
I have used other brands of agave syrup and find this one a little thin. The flavor is fine but it does not have quite the syrupy texture I am used to.;neutral
Bon produit. S'infuse trop rapidement manque un peu de got.;neutral
Great tasting and wonderful value. However, the product arrived damaged even though it was in 2 boxes and each flavor separated into individual bags.;neutral
There's a bit of a strange after-flavor...I think I'll keep looking for a different type of mayo...;neutral
They taste good - was surprised they aren't air tight like in the picture.  The ziplock bag did appear to be well sealed.;neutral
"Don't like the texture
Almost seemed greasy and very gelatinous
Won't but again";neutral
For my taste too much mixed fruit. Nut base was scarce.;neutral
Run of the mill. Healthier but boring.;neutral
I think they are a little stale... but not enough to return them.  I don't think I will re order them again though.;neutral
"Slices are difficult to get out of the package without tearing. Wish the separator papers coverer the entire slice; they're too small. The cheese is great though.";neutral
Taste is okay but not thrilled! Not purchasing anymore!;neutral
tastes kind of bitter. Not the usual ginger tea taste.;neutral
strong egg nog flavor.. And the taste still goes strong long after the expiration date on the box... Here I am still drinking them from a large order placed last winter and I have no regrets.;neutral
Ok so this is my fav but apparently it has gluten cross contaminated.;neutral
This coffee is okay. It has a very mellow flavor. I need to use more beans for a strong enough pot, and since I have several more bold coffee beans I prefer, I will most likely move on.;neutral
Didn't like as well as the maple & brown sugar.;neutral
Not as flavorful as I was hoping for, but okay.  Sesame ones are tastier.;neutral
found them too soft for my taste-no snap but thats just me-;neutral
"good tea

not as strong as i would have likes it to be. I got some from HK few months ago. 3 pearls HK version =5 pearls of numi";neutral
These did not appease my taste...will not reorder.;neutral
mild flavor. Has a lot of uses but i prefer fresh ginger.;neutral
"Coconut water is a natural way of replenishing the electrolytes and potassium you use when you sweat
The taste is a hint of coconut";neutral
A good product but nothing like the fruit cakes I remember eating as a kid during the holiday season. I got the bug and wanted one, purchased this, and it's been OK but nothing like I was hoping for.;neutral
Gave some to some other people Some liked it some didnt. Not for everyone. Made from dorian fruit. The fruit it self stinks;neutral
"Good as far as it goes.  But they don't get very ""beany""  Tasty for back packing but not the consistency of real refrieds.";neutral
I gave some for a Christmas gift and ate the rest.  They were fresh and tasty but all the cans I used were quite crumbly at the bottom.;neutral
The taste is great but the price on Amazon is pretty steep. Buy elsewhere.;neutral
Natural maybe? but no taste and if there is it lasts less than 3 minutes. If you just like chewing things then its okay do not buy for taste.;neutral
"taste no better than fair; contains cafeine";neutral
Sort of too sweet for our taste. Other than that it is a good jerky.;neutral
The product was all it was advertised, the s@h was very quick.  I, however, did not like it as much as I had hoped I would for health reasons.;neutral
Too tart for me, it tasted as if it was bad. I take Goji juice regularly and this one was a torture to drink it. Buyers beware if you get this delivered to a very hot area...like Miami;neutral
I prefer stevia without the vanilla.;neutral
Not sure if this is a black tea. Nether color nor taste-wise.;neutral
The roses came nicely packed. Quality was OKAY;neutral
not very good i tried other stuff that i liked but not this will not buy ever again.;neutral
These were OK. The pastry held together, they were a decent size and texture. The filling just didn't have enough flavor to be really tasty.;neutral
Nice coffee, like it, don't love it.  Guess I'm just not getting that glazed donut flavor.;neutral
I like Chex Mix and normally just buy the traditional flavor, and I think in the future I will stick with the traditional. This doesn't taste nearly as good for some reason.;neutral
It's a perfect cup of soup if salt is not in your diet. It has body but no salt. Great for cooking. 3 stars for - it has no sodium!!;neutral
Nothing to recommend this product.  It staves off hunger for a few hours, so I guess that's satisfactory.;neutral
Nothing to dislike about this whole berry cranberry sauce as far as I'm concerned except the price, but you pay for the convenience, and it tided me over to skip a trip to the market.;neutral
Good for a quick meal that has no gluten;neutral
I used this as a replacement for olive oil in a veg stir fry.  You CAN taste the coconut and it made the stir fry too sweet.  Someone told me it makes a great skin cream though!;neutral
Tastes oddly as you might expect a fresh cut lawn to taste.;neutral
This is strange cinnamon.  I am wondering if it is Cinnamon bark and not real cinnamon.;neutral
Lots of soup with potatoes and clams. A bit more fishy than I prefer but good price for good soup otherwise. I add some lemon pepper to soften the fish aftertaste.;neutral
Alright, but nothing special. Starbucks Sumatra is easy better, although pricier.;neutral
I love the turbinado sugar but unfortunately it is very expensive here compared to places like Sam's Club where it is around eight dollars for the 6 pound bag.;neutral
I had to get use to the taste of these. I was use to eating the sugar kind so at first didn't like.  I now snack on these daily.;neutral
good quality product.  a little lack luster in the taste department.  I added lots of fruit!!!  I preferr it over plain oat meal.;neutral
Not finding the tomato base as versatile.  Tastes ok.;neutral
great cookies!  just needs a cushioned packaging to avoid crumbling in transport;neutral
Does not taste like cola, but doesn't taste bad. Kinda tastes root bearish.;neutral
I will use for smoothies and since it has less fat and calories will probably buy again but this does not have the rich peanut butter taste from the real thing but in a smoothie it will be good enough.;neutral
These were pretty tasty, but more sugary than coffee flavor.  I've had other coffee candies that have had a much stronger coffee flavor.;neutral
Ok, but i'm use to better salt and pepper.;neutral
Not very vanilla-y.  I've bought powdered vanilla before that was much more concentrated.  This one is not very strong.;neutral
It's ok, but, not as much actual coffee flavor vs/ fruit flavor. It's good for a cup off and on.;neutral
Not that delicious like some said, not in my opinion. I was hoping the flavor was a little richer and I found it tasted rather flat. I have tried a lot of different types of bouillon and this one was just ok.;neutral
another dented tin... also the mints are more brittle than i remember them being.  maybe a bad batch.  but ok;neutral
This fruit leather is made primarily with apple--not apricot. Not that apple is bad for you, but ultimately it has a rather bland taste. Next time I'll just buy dried apricots and save a lot of money!!!;neutral
Says raw in small print, but it neither looks, nor tastes raw.;neutral
good chocolate not worth month plus wait though...;neutral
It is a decent coffee, considering that is  not freshly roasted . Still retained some aroma and oils. The quality of coffee and price is acceptable . Would buy it again.;neutral
a little hard to get the right mix.  It is ok.;neutral
Thought was going to be what and soy-free. Will not be repurchasing. They have much better products.;neutral
The last 2 bags I've gotten have been very soft.  Not hard like jawbusters should be.;neutral
The flavor was good, but I thought that the candies themselves were too large, and when you bit into them the chocolate always crumbled and fell away from the filling, making it a messy treat.;neutral
This brew is pretty good.  I actually prefer the Chicago style Giardiniera and add some capers and olives.;neutral
Must know how to use the fluor, but it is a decent quality. I mix it with other fluors to create low carb bakery items, and this Organic Coconut Fluor delivers nicely. 4 Stars.;neutral
I bought this to mix with tuna and mayo for a quick tuna salad.  It's a bit more liquid than I would like.  The flavor is OK, but I think next time I'll go back to chopping my own pickles.;neutral
Fine bread.  Never really tastes fresh to me but my kids like it.  And it's not super easy to find organic bread.  It comes frozen, just so ya know.;neutral
The ginger is overpowering.  It's about as strong as the cinnamon.  So I was very disappointed.  Not that it tastes bad, but just not like any other apple pie spice I've ever tasted.;neutral
"There were pretty good. The caramel were very good but the ""chocolate"" were OK at best. Tey the sugar free reece's cups!";neutral
Pretty average jerky. Won't buy again;neutral
The flavor is wonderful, but they are all broken into tiny,tiny pieces and dust. Would give 5 stars if they arrived in better shape!;neutral
It's a tasty product, but there was so little in the package for the cost.;neutral
I didn't care for the taste, but this is my first experience with lavender tea. I always drink the Yogi blueberry green tea and thought I would branch out.;neutral
Great for the holiday but too expensive for routine purchase.;neutral
question. why not use real chocolate.;neutral
Not terrible but I won't buy it again. Good that it's zero calories but just not quite there on the taste. Walden's other products are much better.;neutral
These dates are a little tough and dry. I bought because they are organic, but would not buy again.;neutral
It is a little too sweet.  You can't use much because of the sweetness and therefore don't get much chocolate flavor.  I'll keep it in the frig in case of emergency.;neutral
Bought it for myself but my brother saw it and took it home with him. I'll have to order some more for me.;neutral
Use 8oz. setting. I deleted mine to much.;neutral
Purchased this as a gift and it was so well received that I had to buy more. Fortunately it is sold at Ikea and the Home Goods store;neutral
Quick, easy but I like the darker Italian Roast, which was not available.;neutral
great tast but a lot of money for three Gummy Peppers....;neutral
flavor not very strong. very sticky.;neutral
Some of the warheads are sticky, and you can't get them out of the wrapper.  Not a huge amount, but maybe one out of fifteen.;neutral
Disappointed as I love Vanilla Hazlenut coffee but hard to find decaf K cups. Don't taste the vanilla at all. Has a slightly bitter taste and with the vanilla missing my taste buds say nay.;neutral
It was not flavorful enough for me but was healthy to eat. My kids and husband didn't care for it but I finished it off because of my purchase. Needs some more kick to it otherwise great.;neutral
They're not bad, but definitely not my favorite... they have more of a 'waxy' taste than they do grape flavor. It's a huge bag for the price though, so if you like these candies then you are in luck!;neutral
"I have't met an almond butter I didn't like; but this one is too expensive and I didn't love the flavor; but if price isn't an issue and you like raw almond butter this may be the right choice for you.";neutral
There are only a few K-cup options for hot chocolate, including Swiss Miss.  I prefer the hot chocolate K Cups that are produced by Keurig over these - more chocolatey.;neutral
Not the minty blast I usually get from similar products. Subtle in that department.;neutral
They we're pretty good. Yes the rapper stick to the candy trying to to get it opened like. Others then that they taste fine.;neutral
not the best taste but it does help make things creamy.;neutral
I wasn't thrilled with these, and being an adult, was disappointed with the amount in each package.  Needless to say, they were gone very quickly.;neutral
These were edible, but not fresh like what you get in the store.;neutral
This is a milder coffee and is great for people who do not want something overwhelming.  In my house we prefer bolder roasts.;neutral
I honestly love these, but they are much pricier than other ones I've found online and locally in grocery stores.;neutral
Very rich but not sweet enough for me.;neutral
I'm not at all impressed by this coffee. It hardly has the strength of a true dark toast, and it definitely doesn't have that signature Starbucks flavor.;neutral
I am a bit disappointed with my last shipping because some of the pods paper wrapping were torn open, seems the quality used to be better before? But they are still OK.;neutral
This was ok. I ended up moving to a different stevia product however (in a powder form), which I do prefer.;neutral
"This caramel sauce is super sweet, so sweet my 7 year old niece said ""ew"" to it. It also has a strong coconut flavor. I wouldn't repurchase, but I will use up what I have in very small doses.";neutral
Either I don't remember the taste or the recipe has changed.  It doesn't measure up to what I remember.  We have eaten very little of it.;neutral
It served it's purpose, but didn't taste as good as the brand I usually buy.;neutral
Probably just a matter of preference but as we can buy Pims (cakes not beverage) in the local market, and which we think is a better product, but I think we'll just leave these to the cousins across the pond.;neutral
Not a big fan. It doesn't taste bad...it just isn't something to rave about.;neutral
High in sugar (carbs) but what does one expect for an energy bar!? Tastes good. Somewhat better than Costco's similar bar. It's really a fancy candy bar with a health label on it. Tasty, low in protein.;neutral
not bad but think making a PBJ would be more tastey;neutral
I buy the skinny popcorn all the time the white cheddar this the first time it had no taste i could not taste any white cheddar at all;neutral
"the chocolate come in a horrible conduction, I decide not to send this to my friend as a present.
But stuff inside is still good.";neutral
Just did not taste fresh and it was runny which makes me question delivery. I like this product but this batch was spoiled;neutral
decent but the hazelnut are far superior;neutral
coffee has a slightly bitter taste.;neutral
It is okay but I have decided that only real chocolate tastes good. If you absolutely cannot use real chocolate, then this would be the next best thing.;neutral
Trying to get off of Splenda  because it spikes your glucose levels. This is okay but does have an aftertaste;neutral
No flavor, they just taste like sugar cubes, but cute.;neutral
Loved how quick and east this was to use. I actually added a bit of siracha sauce for spice, but will buy this again.;neutral
Not enough honey or almonds, was looking for a cereal where you know when you are biting into the almonds not 90% oats with some minced almonds thrown in.;neutral
This is Ok but is not of the same genre as the 7-11 or gas station type flavors.  We are back to our standard homemade hot cocoa using the Hershey recipe.;neutral
The product tastes artificial and contains oil;neutral
Bought this for my granddaughter, she is on a gluten free diet and this is a must if you are on one of those diets.;neutral
These little packets are handy, and the taste is OK, but guess I'm becoming more of a brewed coffee drinker in my old age!;neutral
Does the job, keeps you up. But tastes kind of like cough syrup.  I like the other flavors of hi*ball. It was worth a try.;neutral
This tea didn't taste any different than your cheap lipton tea in my opinion.  I love the afternoon tea so much better.  That is the one in the orange container (not red);neutral
I love V8 juice, but this is a little pricey.;neutral
Pretty closed to expiration date when I got it.;neutral
It was recommended by a friend.  I tried it, it was different but I won't order it again.  It smells wonderful brewing.;neutral
"Chocolate Teddy Grahams taste better and have nothing artificial in them. These are not nearly as good, and I'm not sure the ""quality"" of the ingredients are any better. They are also higher calorie.";neutral
I like this company a lot but this coffee is only so - so for me.  I drink strong, bitter coffee as a rule.  This one was just different somehow.  Can't explain it.;neutral
I have never had a Slim Jim before (normally use beef jerky pieces).  These have an ok flavor, but leave a fairly waxy flavor in your mouth.  I will finish the box, but I will not be purchasing again.;neutral
Not one of my favorites but it will do in a pinch!;neutral
Has savory aftertaste & texture more like grits or maybe cornmeal. Would be better to fix & eat like oatmeal or grits substitute.;neutral
not much for the price, but they do taste good;neutral
This batch seemed to have a different composition than my previous order.  It smelled different and seems more oily.;neutral
I had higher expectations and may have expected too much.  Good stuff but I like the fish jerky more (as a shelf-storable fish).;neutral
I like Jordan almonds and this was a good amount for the money.;neutral
So not excited, but maybe it is me.  Odd flavor, but works in soup.  Would not use in mushroom sauce, or something fancy.;neutral
This would probably be ok in a smoothie, but I don't like it in water.  Way to grainy and kind of sticks in my throat.;neutral
I've always loved rose tea, but compared to Tulsi, this did not impress me.;neutral
Parents liked it but the kids preferred the yellow corn.;neutral
This product is just OK... I'm not crazy about the taste.  Seems sour.  Not worth the price so we will not be buying it again.;neutral
Did not like these suckers. Thought there would be caramel on the inside, not on the outside. so they were pretty tart in flavor. But my niece just loves them so I will rate them a 3;neutral
It doesn't have the flavor of the original. Different company, way different taste. Hum drum. It's not worth getting cavities over.;neutral
This bread is good, no complaints.  I was looking for what is called a seeded bread, and this is not it.  I did buy the seeded mix from King Arthur and add that to this for a great bread.;neutral
Not crazy about the square box.  Little bits of salt leak out of it every time it is used.  I love the product, but not this particular packaging.;neutral
This is good for your mouth, but is harder than other brands I've tried.  It also does not stay chewy as long.;neutral
It's okay. Not nearly as seasoned as I was hoping.;neutral
"Usually love Glutino products
This did not measure up
Seemed to disintegrate, not smooth,no replacement for the genuine article!";neutral
I was really expecting these to be amazing after hearing people rant and rave about them. They're perfectly edible, but they aren't my families favorite by far.;neutral
some of the tops are hard to get off. Food sticks more than with Pam,sorry to say this!!;neutral
Trying a new brand, this honey was a disappointment.  It is sweet, it is honey, but it left an aftertaste and made the tea taste peculiar.;neutral
Like one other reviewer mentioned - you can make pretty good tea by pouring boiling water over one of these bags. However, I found the tea to be weak and flavorless when following the cold brew instructions.;neutral
These were easy to make, but had a strange, off putting flavor neither the kids, or adults, liked.  It was almost like the nuts were sour.;neutral
don't love the taste. reminiscent of marzipan.;neutral
It is NOT caffeine free...it kept me up till 3 am... Tastes great but if rooibos tea is caffeine free than something else is mixed in this.;neutral
Not so great but I guess thats just me;neutral
A nice tea but not sweet enough for terrible sweet tooth...will finish the bag, though.;neutral
it wasn't as good as I hoped but honestly this was my first try at using bulgur wheat so I won't say its any less quality than any others, but I won't be using it again;neutral
"I will get this again, but I will mix it with Carbone Golden malted mix. On it's own it is simply to ""gritty.""";neutral
Tastes good at first. It's kind of like a flat kitkat, without the delicious flavor. Leaves a weird maybe bitter after taste.;neutral
Wasn't what I expected. Better than Nutella though.;neutral
The product was fine, it was just the flavor that was kind of weird.  Most of us didn't care for it.;neutral
Product is good but found Organic Dates at Safeway at lower price and no shipping cost.;neutral
Just OK... fine quality but not my preferred coffee... I much prefer the Ethiopian Yirgacheffe  which I bought also..... It is a fine, smooth coffee like I like... roasted just to the second crack.;neutral
I like the flavor, but they are excessively salty.;neutral
coffee is fine, just a little too much chocolate flavor for my personal taste.;neutral
These seemed a bit dryer than we're accustomed to.;neutral
Not bad, a bit disappointed having most other products from MARY'S.;neutral
Tried other cadbury chocolate spreads but this one is probably my least favorite. I don't really know why but perhaps the crunchie spread was just that great and set the bar too high.;neutral
Nothing to write home about, it's apple cider vinegar;neutral
"I bought the ground by mistake, which is rather coarse imo, and didn't get so rich tasting in my espresso machine. *sniff* ""Coffee water""...lol.  I'm going to try the beans and see how that goes...";neutral
Too mild for me, but a pleasant blend of spices.;neutral
The chocolate was good but it came melted in the bag, no chips just a block. There was no insulation in the box.;neutral
"Not impressed; have had others that are much better.";neutral
DOESN'T REALLY TASTE LIKE BROWN SUGAR AND IS NOT VERY SWEET COMPARED TO OTHER SUGAR FREE SUGAR;neutral
Not exactly what I expected for results, maybe after some experiments I can figure out what I did wrong.;neutral
Compare the labels with the other Cappuccino mixes that Hills Brothers makes.  This is not skinny.  Flavor is OK, but nothing special.;neutral
This product is on the sweet side and thin, but tastes pretty good.  I would prefer a non sweetened product.;neutral
OKAY BUT NOT WHAT I WANTED, BUT OKAY FOR RUN OF THE MILL RECIPES, GOOD VALUE;neutral
they were good but not great, like the lemon tang but the cookies were very thin to be shortbread cookies..;neutral
"Not sure if these are authentic. Seemed less sour and bag read ""Made in Turkey"". Still good though.";neutral
I'm sorry.  I did not enjoy this much because it did not taste like my grandmother's!  :-);neutral
Few rotten was among them,that why I give it a 3;neutral
lot of salt (sodium) even without the MSG!;neutral
It's OK. I will probably try something else next time.;neutral
I've read that fennel can can reduce stomach distress. I've tried taking a half teaspoon of these seeds followed by a small glass of water. The results were not too successful.;neutral
Too much artificial taste for my liking, but the flavor is good.;neutral
Not as good as some sugar free treats to me. Costs too much in my opinion;neutral
Have to return it too pricey for only three garlic;neutral
Very good. Just sweet enough but a little dry.;neutral
I thought I read that no sugar was added but when it arrived I  read where there are 23 grams of sugar. Even with all that sugar it tastes on the sour side.  I would not buy it again.;neutral
This isn't bad, but I am not a big fan of the fennel in it, and I think the Rosemary is too prominent. It's okay, and I won't waste it, but I won't buy it again.;neutral
"This came with very high recommendations from a friend, so I thought I would give it a try.
It was ok, but at $4 a bowl a bit expensive.
You can get as good or better at a lower price.";neutral
Company's customer service sucks, but the product is great.  In fact if it wasn't the only flour I can stomach, being Celiac, I wouldn't order from them.  My hands are tied.  Hence the 3 star rating.;neutral
Good value but the flavor needs something to be desired.  The nuts must be old because it has a slight rancid flavor;neutral
Not the best, it was too sweet for me but I did use it all... I would actually rather buy the grocery store brand when its on sale for $1.50 than ever buying Kraft again...;neutral
Not a bad flavor, just not as intense as some of the imports that are available. Great price, about a third of the better imports - so definitely useable at the price point.;neutral
Flavor was OK.  Not sure I'd put them in the gourmet gumball category, but what gumball really is gourmet?  I'd take good ole Double Bubble over these any day.;neutral
A diabetic in the house: These are great in specially made low carb cookies -- I do use almond flour. Also we use these in a snack mixture with rice snacks, raisins, nuts. We all enjoy them.;neutral
It has a good taste, but you can only stand maybe half of one of the little disks per sitting... and this is coming from someone with a huge sweet tooth.;neutral
Sweeter than the one I tried from the market of the same labeling. Thought I could eat right out the jar.  Need to unthicken it!;neutral
Eh, doesnt really have that nutty oolong taste. Tastes more like a weak jasmine tea;neutral
Strange taste, like something very old and out of expiration period;neutral
I had many many many kernels that did not pop, I'd say 1/4 to 1/3 of bag.;neutral
cannot taste much of the monkfruit. It is overwhelmed by the other ingredient;neutral
Because of the sugar alcohol, this candy, while  tasty, causes really bad gas. If you eat more than three pieces, it turns into gastric distress/diarrhea.;neutral
We found this a bit too strong for our tastes.;neutral
Not as good as chocolate chip peanut butter or blueberry crunch.;neutral
Not terribly tasty.  If you're looking for your favorite Indian place's saag paneer, this isn't it.  Very mushy, with the kind of iron taste that you would experience from canned spinach.  Not much cheese.;neutral
Ive bought this honey before, same brand..I was a little disappointed with this jar, it seemed very full of firm wax.;neutral
Made Angel Biscuits with this and it is way too heavy for that recipe. They tasted good but very dense and took forever to cook. This would be good for brownies.;neutral
"Delicious! Sweet enough for dessert but won't ruin your clean eating.

Update: These are really good, I did get one however that seemed fermented..";neutral
good  gum  flavor doesn't last too long  though;neutral
I bought this cause it's in Heinze no salt added ketchup and that is fantastic, but his stuff tastes like potassium big time, but to keep my blood pressure under control I use it...;neutral
I like this noodle but I hate the dried mushroom that comes with it. If it didn't have that mushroom, I would buy it all the time.;neutral
Difficult to taste the Hazelnut flavor. Overall too sweet for my tastes.;neutral
It is god, but no better than a lot of other hot sauces.  I guess Louisana just fits my taste buds.;neutral
A good deal, but the mix had a LOT of mint truffles, including six with Christmas wrappers. I couldn't put them out for company in April without looking like a putz.;neutral
they were okay - not amazing - not worth the cost.;neutral
I bought this chocolate to make some holiday candy last December. While the quality was good I did not see significantly better results than I get with supermarket chocolate chips. Would not but again.;neutral
ok but not as good as The Tao of tea;neutral
Sauce is consistently good but the dented can caused me to use the can immediately, well before I intended to. Better packaging is needed.;neutral
It is a nice change to drinking something hot, it is ok but coffee is the junk for the morning brew!!!;neutral
A little tough and salty. But interesting and better than red vines.;neutral
This dessert gum was requested by my wife.  It is delicious, however... the flavor is only good for around 10 minutes.  The mint chocolate chip lasts 20 or more.  Good gum, but short lived flavor.;neutral
Great flavor but very tough to get out of the wrapper without losing half of the caramel.;neutral
"Yep, OK for sautee but would not choose it for making dressings or drizzling for additional flavor.  Decent price for decent oil - no more; no less.";neutral
I love BTC products, but the raspberry is a bit intense!  Not as yummy as the chocolate.;neutral
Bought these for our office Keurig and they haven't been a very big hit.  A little bitter;neutral
i love their cheddar cheese but the quinoa was just ok;neutral
I prefer the hard candy versions. They have little flavor in comparison.;neutral
It's cut with other oils. Don't bother buying it if you think it's pure olive oil. Pure is way more expensive.;neutral
They are poptarts, good for on the go;neutral
It tastes good, but it is a little runny.;neutral
Lots of color, little cheese flavor ;neutral
"These baklavah are actually quite tasty, but it's really really pricy. It's $16 for a tiny box. I'd give it 5 stars if it were a little cheaper.
My kids don't want me to get it again.";neutral
"This coffee tastes good, but nowhere on the package does it state ""Swiss water processed"" as it is advertised, and so I doubt very seriously it is.  I will order it in the future only as a last resort.";neutral
Bought this based an article about classic condiments and how they raved about it so I thought I would try it.  Meh - it tastes like Grey Poupon without the wine flavoring.;neutral
Good quality oil but not much flavor.;neutral
The product is great and would have gotten 5 starts but the shipping packaging was poor. One container of oatmeal broke open inside the box making quite a mess.;neutral
Have to use 2 bags or it tastes like water.;neutral
It's not bad, but it resembles strawberry jam too much.  I think there are better choices out there.;neutral
I am a bit lost on where to use it.,;neutral
We bought this at the same time as the Cooks Powdered Vanilla, but did not like the taste as well as the other. It's not bad, but in our opinion was not as good as the other.;neutral
For the price, I'm disappointed. BUT while package is small it's funny and will bring a smile to the person I bought it for - not worth the cost still, but live and learn!;neutral
This product tastes very good, and it is a quality product. However, we have found another product at Target that is much cheaper and tastes the same.;neutral
Coffee is great, but this 11 oz size costs much more than the 22 oz size of same.;neutral
I'm indifferent about this product.  I should say - don't bother?  I tried it for medicanal purposes and it doesn't seem to have made any difference........so save your money.;neutral
This was ok coffee. I was not impressed enough with it to buy again. I have found dark roast coffees at the local market that are just as good and better.;neutral
The texture of these is not at smooth at regular Gin-Gin chews. The flavor is slightly more spicy but the grainy texture not so good.;neutral
Guess its ok for some, but I won't be ordering again.;neutral
This is just OK product, I found somewhat insipid and bland, did not have enough flavor. I think I will resume making my own. I do not like food stored in plastic.;neutral
Not like a traditional mom meatloaf.;neutral
good product - just not what I expected;neutral
I've used other brands that required a lot less to thicken liquids.;neutral
The Monster Rehab Tea + Pink lemonade is very different than the original Monster drink, doesn't exactly taste like Tea or Pink lemonade, but it does the trick with minimal calories.;neutral
I like these biscuits but not a fan of the blueberry. I like the other flavors better. It does smell very nice though.;neutral
good stuff very tasty however the bags are small for the price;neutral
"After reading all of these reviews I expected something great, but these noodles were bland. I was very dissapointed. I had high hopes..too high I guess.

Oh, and MSG doesn't make it any better...";neutral
It would be better if grey carried diet irn bru but my husband likes the full sugar since it's all we could find. The price is  a bit high but lower than the nearest British import shop.;neutral
Ok price for an ok candy. Doesn't taste nearly as good as I remembered them tasting as a kid.;neutral
I will not buy again because this simply was not worth 16 dollars!  Tasted no different from grocery store brands.  Disappointed.;neutral
I've different cups size brews to serve up a little variety and have been repeatedly underwhelmed as this is mediocre compared to Green Mountain's Columbian Coffee K-Cups.;neutral
So the mayo is just awful, put it on a sandwich and couldn't eat more than 1 bite to save my life. The dressing however is really good on salads.;neutral
A big price for a little amount. Make your own.;neutral
These were kinda alright. Not the best or worst, just alright. I like gingerbread though, but I think it's really hard to emulate this taste and texture in a candy properly. I'd give 3.5 if it was an option.;neutral
Good but not as good as others I've had. There isn't enough mint so the chocolate is a bit over powering.;neutral
Stop using non sugar crap! It tastes good until the after taste of that stevia crap hits ya.;neutral
I am honestly surprised I didn't like the 'famous' Petes Coffee.  For my taste, it as no better than less expensive coffee I purchase. I was expecting a deep bold flavor.  I would not purchase again.;neutral
These would have gotten 4 or 5 stars had the vendor been more careful & sent better dated boxes. I should have called & asked to return them. Good taste & filling.;neutral
This item is ok for the price and taste. I will not reorder as I am not a chocolate lover. But it is good for what I paid.;neutral
The quality of the ingredients seem to be high with more meat in it than i expected. But for me, the soups are a bit too spicy.;neutral
Meh, these are o.k. but pricier than others.;neutral
Item when in hand doesn't look like the picture. I found the chocolate to be too sweet and the nuts too small.  Needs more nuts too.  That's my opinion anyway.  I'm 74 years old.;neutral
different taste than the umf 20's.  not gonna repeat because there's just too many other manuka honey's on the market to try.;neutral
The cookies were a little to well done,;neutral
Easy side dish, cooks up quick and once you figure out the time cooks consistently but just not very flavorful. Uncooked it has a nice smell but smell and flavor seem to fade with cooking. I;neutral
They are okay, just a little tangy.;neutral
The flavor is good but it gets extremely hard and tasteless within a few minutes. It seems all Xylitol gums suffer from this problem.;neutral
I can't even taste the maple which is why I wanted it and I found it cheaper at our local grocery;neutral
This seasoning only comes a little over 1/2 full.  It would have been nice to get all of the seasoning I ordered.;neutral
I love their product, but much prefer the regular toasted coconut chips.  I ended up putting these lightly salted ones in with the granola where they are great.;neutral
I found this product to be a watered down version of what used to be a great soup. Such a shame.;neutral
"These are delicious, i can not recommend them enough.
They are unbelievably tasty.";neutral
Although I really like this candy, they arrived partially melted. Might have just been bad luck. They were still edible ( after I refrigerated them).;neutral
"On the sweet side and I wanted ""RAW"" but received the wrong ones twice so just kept this one.";neutral
These biscuits are OK. Not as yummy as the ones with chocolate.;neutral
Disappointed that this does not have the USDA Organic certification.;neutral
I will pass on these, I know what bergamot is,  so was disappointed.  Will not purchase again.;neutral
This stuff is getting pinker with every order.  Used to really be premium cuts, now I'm not so sure anymore.;neutral
Great pack but the black tea is terrible and the red one is super sweet. I would probably only go once;neutral
Prefer a different brand but this was the one available and works fine.;neutral
This stuff is reputed to make baked goods rise higher.  Goods rose to about the same height as with normal baking powder;neutral
Way too sweet for me but others liked them. Numerous broken cookies in shipping.;neutral
Gave to friend, didn't care for the chocolate flavor.;neutral
For a quick cup, this is fine but it does not have the body or full flavor of tea brewed with a bag or loose tea.;neutral
Just OK. Best if dipped in coffee. I can make better biscotti at home.;neutral
A bit sweeter than I expected. I will be using it again in my baking so ask me again in two months.;neutral
The filling is kind of gross looking and tasting;neutral
"Previous 3 ordered they were prefect. Last order they were smashed bruised and black from the inside.
Im hoping next time will be better. I got full refund.";neutral
Handy to have on hand,tasty,but not really excellent. Could use more chicken flavor. Container size a bit much for one,& fairly high sodium content.;neutral
This does not have much flavor.  Dry cardboard and over processed.;neutral
3 stars because it is in the middle. i do not like coconut, so i can't rate it high, but it is exactly what it says it is, so there is no reason to rate it low.;neutral
I guess I have been drinking Maxwell House coffee for so long that Folgers Coffee did not satisfy my taste buds.;neutral
The coffee is good but not as bold as I prefer. The problem with this assortment is there are too many flavored coffees included which I only keep for guests. The price is exceptionally low.;neutral
No flavor, like most decaf teas. PG Tips is usually a good tea for packaged. Good flavor. But the decaf falls flat. Wouldn't buy again. Was worth a try I suppose.;neutral
Have to use so much just to get a hint of taste. Will keep trying to find something with that cheddar that goes so great on popcorn;neutral
I don't love this one. I like medium roast, bright, clean coffee.  This one is a bit earthy, not dark, but if peat moss had medium roast, that's the gist.;neutral
Some of the chocolate flavors have a bitter after taste.  The variety of flavors are a chocolate lovers dream!;neutral
The idividual bags are small but the chocolate is good. Nice for a party favor and kids were happy;neutral
It's kind of like a spicy duck sauce (same color too), it's ok but not that impressed, I guess it's a decent spicy duck sauce if I was going for that.;neutral
Doesn't melt well. Taste is good though.;neutral
theyre good but waaaaayyyy to sweet for me.  also small.;neutral
For my baby I try not to give her sweet candy, this is too sweet for her.;neutral
It was OK taste, but maybe because I am a picky eater. It had some after taste which I did not care for.;neutral
"Tastes the same as regular green beans. No pesticides so that's good, but taste is not like fresh green beans which is what I was hoping for (at least a little more.) ;-)";neutral
"I was excited to get this organic, fair trade hot chocolate. Unfortunately, it was just too sweet for me  - BTW I am a HUGE chocoholic!
Swing and a miss for me, but try it you might enjoy it.";neutral
Great tasting, fresh--I think the price is a little high;neutral
Fast delivery- I am used to San Francisco Truffle salt and just felt this(WILD) was OK.;neutral
Just okay,  nothing to rave about. Prefer other brands. A little hard,  crunchy.;neutral
doesn't taste good...but suppose to be good for plaque;neutral
Would have given better rating if it had warned of the high concentration of milk solids. This adds up on the carbs.;neutral
Too sweet for my taste but otherwise good.;neutral
They are kind of hard and not that tasty;neutral
I found this difficult to use and prefer the coconut creme from my local specialty grocery store.;neutral
The description of this product sounded so tasty but it just falls short of being what I enjoy in an iced coffee.  I did find that using less water in my single cup machine helps with the flavor.;neutral
"I love these gel-dyes, but the orange color is lighter then i expected. Its still a great
Halloween orange. The tubs are very small.";neutral
Fries prettyfood but has no taste. Smell great. Mightnot buy no more. Seasoning seems like it don't help. Make you not wan to eat healthy. Might bake cake with the rest.;neutral
Tastes fine but I haven't figured out how to fully take advantage of this product and how to use it to its full potential. Hardly any examples anywhere.;neutral
It's ok, not full of the fat of regular  peanut butter, but it satisfies my cravings.;neutral
Not that great tasting, just so so. A little bit tougher to chew than the peanut butter(my fav). Would not purchase again.;neutral
Average. Not too sure I would buy again.;neutral
Good for when the throat is dry, not too many calories.;neutral
It's ok, but definitely not the best chili powder you can buy. I'm going to buy the other brand next time called House.;neutral
This gum tastes like Dr. Pepper, but it a little too sweet for me,  I'm an adult so maybe children would like it better.;neutral
its just ok.  used a french press method.  I guess its a good deal for the money.;neutral
It's ok. This could be made with half the fat and twice the taste, like most jimmy dean products. I'm from the south and have had way better with way less.;neutral
It's just white tea.  I use it for making Kombucha.  Not sure how organic it really is since it's from China, but it works.;neutral
Tasted ok, but the colors are unnecessary and stain.  I wouldnt buy again.;neutral
"a bit too hot for my taste; none-the-less tasty";neutral
Not thrilled w/ the smell/ taste  and ground of the pepper ... But it's fine nothing bad just my being particular.;neutral
Not the best taste in the world. They were just ok. For the price, it would be nice if they tasted better.;neutral
great product but found it $6 cheaper at costco.;neutral
Haven't tried using on low Carb recipes yet.;neutral
could not taste the honey. The added moisture in the honey allowed it freeze faster than plain peanut butter.;neutral
Although I like them, I got tired of them really quick (strong flavor) and they give me gas!;neutral
no as good as black tea,caza black richer in taste;neutral
I like the packaging, but I like better tasting pepper more than I like packaging. Nothing like fresh ground pepper.;neutral
These do not last nearly long enough, especially when you factor in the cost!;neutral
First of all, it looks nothing like the picture. It's jerky, SA style. Different taste, similar texture to jerky. Not sure about it.;neutral
this is a good cereal. great price for the price of one........Shoot one box of cereal at the supermarket cost me 4.99, So I would order again If I want;neutral
"I like Kirkland products, I have no problem with quality and taste of this salt; however, I like a Sea Salt that is more coarse and far less granulated than this one.";neutral
I'm sure a lot of people like this item...for me a bit too sour.  Love the lemon flavor they make.;neutral
OK, not LIMEY enough for me  but it is OK for now.;neutral
Happy with this purchase!  Would LOVE to see green organic stevia!!  The less processing the better!!;neutral
not strong enough for me, but then again, Starbucks has spoiled me !;neutral
I ordered this before and was pleased with it.  This second one doesn't have much of the smell or taste of hazelnut.;neutral
"Good flavor, but entirely too runny; it dribbles off whatever you put it on. Definitely expected more rind and less jelly at this price. Probably will not buy again.";neutral
its okay is an apt description and it can be used in soups, stews, etc., but really didn't care for it as a vegetable. of course in an emergency i would not be complaining;neutral
I love these things, but most of the bread sticks were broken in half and hard to get the chocolate on it;neutral
These seem very sweet to me. Not the best I have ever had. They would be a whole lot better if they were not as sweet.;neutral
"I traditionally love Rep.of Tea.  These were good, but a bit
strange at the same time.  Not as ""chocolate-y"" as I would like.";neutral
Not very much flavor and not very fresh. Wouldnt buy again.;neutral
Not too impressed. It has a bergamot taste to it.  Would not buy again. Will stick to Taylor's and Twinings teas.;neutral
Wanted to try it.. wasn't horrible, wasn't amazing. Glad I tried it, probably won't get it again.;neutral
Disgustingly sweet. It tastes like I'm drinking powdered honey.;neutral
These aren't as spinach-y or garlic-y as I like, but that is a personal preference.  They are an overall bland flavor, but okay for a cheese topping.;neutral
I haven't quite figured out how to use this and it doesn't offer any suggestions.;neutral
"Was a small box
Disappoint
Not a good value for the money";neutral
Decent tea. Good flavor, but very mild. To get the strength I like, I have to use almost twice as much as other brands. Not sure I would buy again.;neutral
Advertised as grade A, yet what I received was clearly marked grade B. The beans were fine, however I don't like the bait and switch deception, that's just not right.;neutral
It is a matter of taste. I love the taste of pineapple, but the combination of pineapple and orange just did not do it for me. Your mileage may vary;neutral
"It is a great tasting product. Easy to use..

Problem is much to spicy for the remaining family members..

Good point. More for me!!";neutral
I born in area close to Caspian Sea ,so I know the real taste,this not eve close. Too salted,couldn't even eat,I gave it to my friends,they hate it too,will never buy again and not recommend to anybody;neutral
Wasnt crazy about it and probably wouldnt buy it again. Just not the right taste for me.;neutral
I use it to party longer. A teaspoon before the party starts lets me drink more.;neutral
It's ok, but it tastes really starchy.;neutral
A bit spicy as it should be but very salty.  O.K. for the starving student.;neutral
Sweet and tasty, Wouldn't want it all the time, but it makes a good change of pace.;neutral
It DID survive and has greenery on it, I have planted it among the other fruiting trees and hope to get some fruit aometime.;neutral
Best coconut oil I have used. Use for face, skin and cook with it! Very good on wheat toast with peanut butter!;neutral
not as good as other nuts I have tried;neutral
A bit grainer than others we have had. Good price though.;neutral
Had high hopes but no matter how I tweaked my preparation method I couldn't get past the burnt taste of this coffee.;neutral
Did not care for this decaf as well as the dark roasts.;neutral
It's OK but still prefer my good old coffee!;neutral
the pods were thrown in a box no padding rattled around and dented I like the coffee too overpriced for that;neutral
So much more expensive than can be purchased. This is a good product;neutral
Buy the caramel version of Stroopwafel ... much better tasting. These were still very tasty.;neutral
Tiny little amphibian confection for the price, but I guess you're paying for the novelty;neutral
The drink is exactly as described - tart.  Too tart for me, but an interesting flavor.  I'm mixing mine with a sweeter pineapple juice to make it more to my taste.;neutral
Maybe it's just me, but I didn't notice too much difference in taste.;neutral
do not think it taste like i expected though it tastes good.;neutral
This flavor used to be my favorite but this time around, I wasn't a fan. I'm sticking with vanilla and vanilla almond.;neutral
These are not bad but will mold on you if you don't consume quickly even if you put in the fridge.;neutral
First bite felt like I got punched in the face with onion and garlic. Nice natural cheese flavor. Not personally a fan but they're not bad at all.;neutral
I thought I would love this product, it was too hard and the taste was a little off.  Usually I can eat a lot of junk food, but this I stopped after one taste.;neutral
I like it but I cooked it too thick and my husband didn't.  Will try again.;neutral
Previous cans were stuffed with liver. Now less liver and more oil;neutral
Nice fall flavor in Iced Tea, since I purchase these syrups for that purpose, it definitely tasted like fall and I'd buy it again.;neutral
Not packaged as pictured, was in a plain plastic bag.  Still delicious!!;neutral
It is pleasant, yet, does not seem to be concentrated like others are.  The flavors are not as potent as other brands.  Yet, it was okay, yet, expensive.  Perhaps, I need to try the other flavors.;neutral
This drink is a little on the weak side, probably because I was expecting it to taste more like the juice, but its still a good flavored water drink.;neutral
Deceptive name.  Bought it thinking it was a xyla product and made in the USA.  It is made in China just like Spry.;neutral
Bars are great, but they charge WAY too much for shipping;neutral
The cereal is great. The problem is that each time I order it, the boxes come damaged. I do not think I will order it again because of this.;neutral
Its a fine feta, but when shipping is considered, its not worth the cost. Flavor is OK and it was fresh when received.;neutral
Taste Great. You have to use a lot to sweeten what you drink. I gave it three stars because it is very expensive.;neutral
Not very much salt which is one good thing. Too bad its the salt that makes a chip taste good. Flat flavor...tastes bland.;neutral
If you want to have a heart attack, have a cup of this.;neutral
First time I ordered, the stuff was wonderful. The second time, it seemed to have an off taste. Very disappointed, so I'll have to find a different coffee.;neutral
Not as yummy peachy as I had hoped.;neutral
Purchased as a healthier alternative. I gave it three stars since it was usable but the texture from the food cooked was very off putting.;neutral
Was refreshing but could use packaged tea as well.;neutral
after i ate both jars, i got a recall notice lol;neutral
This was a great value at $2.50 (approximately) what I paid for it the first few times I ordered. Now it's about $7. That's insane! For 40 sticks of gum??!!;neutral
Good coffee. But not exceptional.  Extra kick of caffeine. On the pricey side.;neutral
They are nice, but very spicy. I like spicy food but far too hot!;neutral
Excellent product, but subscribe & save price doubled over past several months.  Much less costly alternatives available online.;neutral
Worked OK for me. Just didn't last as long as I expected it to. But that may be just me. It may work better for someone else. A little pricey though.;neutral
love the product but it's a little costly;neutral
Not bad, but it's definitely missing flavor. Roasted probably would have been better.;neutral
The vanilla is okay - but the frosty chocolate is awesome!;neutral
It turns out that these are okay and were okay the moment they arrived during a cool enough time that they did not melt in shipment, so as a warning do not order when it is over 80 degrees.;neutral
gave me a idea what to order in the future whiv=ch was eight o'clock coffee;neutral
A little disappointed when I received this product.  Over priced for a little salt, pepper and garlic.  I should have read the label before I made the purchase!;neutral
Not very tasty for Chicken Boullion.cubes. I had to double up on it in order to get any real flavor. It was missing the chicken flavordid someone forget to put it in the pot at the factory?;neutral
Ready meals is a good name, heats in a minute and fills the belly.;neutral
They are tiny.  I was thinking I was buying the full size sticks, but these are about half the length or less of the full size slim jims.  The kids enjoyed them just the same.;neutral
Interesting flavor, but I guess it's not exactly what I suspected.  I suggest you try this somewhere before ordering 3 bottles.;neutral
Yummy but full of artificial junk. I feel super guilty eating it. And leave it sitting in my pantry staring back at me making me wonder if I should eat it or not. Sigh.;neutral
These are a good substitute for regular potato chips but don't have much flavor. There just average.;neutral
Leave you very dry mouth so keep a lot of water on hand;neutral
This tea is OK for the price but it is not the best quality. Next time I will buy better tea;neutral
Call me a wimp, but this coffee was too strong for me.  And my wife?  Fugettaboutit.  Some may love it, but not for us.;neutral
This is a high-dollar peanut butter. It is very runny even after mixing. I put it in the 'fridge and it still is somewhat runny after mixing. I will rebuy but try the crunchy next time.;neutral
Comes in handy when babysitting my nieces and nephews;neutral
bit dry and sweet but decent granola bars.;neutral
This product is OK, not able to see the difference in my food when using this as others have indicated. Will use it till it's gone though.;neutral
Good quality product, but not my cup of tea.;neutral
Excellent chocolate, however, found that their was too much Cocoa in the bar for me, and the bar had a slightly  bitter taste. I like sweeter chocolate...;neutral
Wasn't my favorite.  Didn't like the texture.;neutral
Of all the rooibos chais out there, this one is ok, it's definitely not my favorite by far.  But I won't run out anytime soon, that's for sure!;neutral
Not enough in the package but the taste was ok;neutral
the cookies are a great recipe.  unfortunately the last batch I ordered area bit stale.;neutral
It is not seasoned salt.  Salt free substitutes always fall short for me.  It is a tasty seasoning and works well on a variety of dishes.;neutral
Okay. I thought bread would be softer.;neutral
The flavor was just O.K. for a medium roast coffee. Great price but not enough for me to order them again.;neutral
Not my favorite flavor, but not the worst;neutral
It is ok, but I like the plan Black Bean soup better.;neutral
I liked having ramen again, but the sauce was too much for me. The seaweed and miso wasn't quite what I wanted. I kinda had to pick the spices out of my teeth after eating. :S Easy to make tho.;neutral
I would prefer it to be ground less finely.;neutral
the flavacol salt is the only one I like. That alone gets 5 stars. The 2 glaze toppings are not too good.;neutral
Love these little pops, there are just too many butterscotch flavors in there, could use a better distribution of flavors.;neutral
While a close substitute for peanut butter, I didn't particularly care for the taste. I used over half the jar, but missed the flavor of regular peanut butter.;neutral
I like the medium roasts but the only flavored one I can drink  is the toasted cinnamon. Love it, esp. iced with a little milk.;neutral
Yep, it is strong and smooth and tasty but a little too caffeinated for me.  I will try the plain dark roast.;neutral
I bought these because I love honey.  While these do taste good , they have added sugar to honey cheapens the product and reduces the old flavor.;neutral
WOW!  Just be aware this is very small!;neutral
Not my favorite coffee creamer.  It does not taste nearly as good as my Bulletproof coffee with Ghee and Brain Octain.;neutral
"easy to use and the spices to stain your clothes and dishrags -so
be careful and do not drip the liquids...
not a bad taste.....";neutral
a bit thin, not thick like real honey - but its do-able and xylitol is so much better than other sugar substitutes;neutral
I'm sure it is fine but not for me.;neutral
This works fine for making gravy but we didn't care for the taste. We prefer McCormick brand chicken gravy.;neutral
"It has a little bit of a bitter taste, but it goes down smooth.  I added a little cream and sugar it was fine.  I will probably buy it again
sometime.";neutral
Good truffles, but almost all of them were squashed and oxidized.  Likely poor handling and storage at the Amazon end.;neutral
Has good flavor but seemed fattier than usual.;neutral
Product is good but I could have purchased a larger amount for the same buck if I would have gone to an Asian Market.;neutral
The green tea and the tea/lemonade options are excellent.  The peach tea is way too sweet for me, regardless of the amount of sugar added.  It must be an acquired taste.  Gave it away to a neighbour.;neutral
I add milk to my tea, so when I do that, it feel a little weak to me. If you don't, it's probably fine.;neutral
"Pro: The price for the 800 package is great.
Con: Its not real pure Stevia as you would expect from the name. Not that sweet and some after tast. I have to combine it with ""equal"" and get good results.";neutral
"Decent, but, waaaayyyyy OVERPRICED
Yes, it's a larger bottle
Yes, it has a screw on cap
But, REED'S, at least, is BETTA overall";neutral
Really good price on this bulk item PLUS free shipping, can't beat that at my local grocery store. Great survival food, camping food or quick lunch.;neutral
Really strongly coloured, not suitable for everyday use.;neutral
the banana taste was to strong for my liking, I share with others that do llike it;neutral
I thought thus was good sugar until my local grocery store started carrying coconut sugar in their store brand, it is so much better than this.;neutral
My fault I thought this was a big one at that price.;neutral
"Organic, groovy, far out, to the left, Washington State, reuse the bag, these are ok,
kinda dry, but nice quality and packaging, gonna give the bulk shelled ones a try
from a different supplier. Peace.";neutral
After buying the variety pack I discovered the vinegar flavor was too strong and overwhelmed my taste buds.  I now know to taste all flavors before ordering.;neutral
It's probably the best tasting hot chocolate cake up that I've tried, but it's not great;neutral
When they're fresh, they tast great and are perfect for a snack while camping.  I would have given it 5 stars, but they go soggy and tough in about a half year.;neutral
Taking a probiotic now instead of this honey for same reduction of ulcer causing stomach bacteria (less heartburn).;neutral
I really didn't care for this jerky. It's very small pieces and it doesn't have a great texture.;neutral
It is O.K. Tastes more lime  candy rather than curd. I won't buy this again. I can make it better myself. The Welsh Lady spoiled me with her Orange curd.;neutral
"Just like the last flavor it tastes good but it's just a little to ""Mellow"" for me.  Which the flavors of these teas were more intense.";neutral
It needs a stronger rootbeer taste.  By the time enough is added to get a good rootbeer flavor, the stevia is overpowering.;neutral
disappointed, would not buy again, no real taste, pricy.;neutral
These bars are crispy and thin.  When I received them there were only 9 in the box.  I was given a 30% refund due to this error.  The taste is fine, not terrible but I don't think I'd buy them again.;neutral
questionable.... but if the kids don't complain about it, it gets at least 3 stars;neutral
Not as good as the soda, but eatable.;neutral
These taffies were a bit gooier than I'd like. Most of the flavors were good but not strong enough. Our family did not end up finishing the box.;neutral
Seems a lot stronger to me than the ground Breakfast Blend out of a bag.;neutral
it's ok, but the sauce is a little too plain for us.  more tomotoe and no pepper if you know what i mean.;neutral
A little too bland for my liking.  I bought three flavors from these folks and none of them rocked my boat.  For the price, I think I'll try making my own.;neutral
A little too sweet with a bird seed type texture.;neutral
I was hoping for a tart, sour taste.  These are way too sweet.;neutral
Not as good as fresh, but as an add in to other drinks, it is ok.;neutral
Okay but I won't order again.  Too watery with one third creamy at the bottom.;neutral
Good buy just not fond of the flavor of this juice and it contains too much sugar.;neutral
As I wrote above with a similar product, they were not what I expected,  The best were my last mother's, and Whole Food s are also really goood.;neutral
I've ordered this before, and for some reason, this batch tasted much different than usual... Not sure if it was a one-off, or if they changed the recipe, but I was not a fan;neutral
These are probably more healthy than Truvia, but without the bad stuff there is a noticeable aftertaste. Still, for those disciplined enough to be healthy it is a good product.;neutral
My wife loves this, but I think it tasted too strong for an Earl Grey.;neutral
I used to eat these all the time. Then I noticed it contained high fructose corn syrup. Was not sure if this was made from gmo corn or not so had to cancel my subscription.;neutral
Plastic container broke. Expire in 6 months. Taste good.;neutral
Tasted OK but didn't really note it's any difference in my health, will not reorder or recommend to my friends;neutral
While this product is good enough, it's not the intense saturated good quality chocolate, hot fudge rush you may anticipate, based on other reviews.;neutral
It's ok to use for smoothies or cooking, but a bit bitter for drinking like regular matcha. Didn't have the vibrant green color like the more expensive one I buy.;neutral
The ham is good quality, comparable to Boar's Head but not organic or special in any way to justify the price.;neutral
"has a little bit of a bitter taste , but it;s a sight better for me than all the pop i use to drink .";neutral
Had one delivered that was great, another time it was squished and bruised;neutral
The product is pretty expensive considering the amount of pecans provided. I thought they tasted okay, but my family thought they were a little stale. I baked with them.;neutral
These taste great.  I'm glad the noodles are made with whole wheat... but it's only 51%.  I prefer 100% whole wheat.;neutral
This has somewhat of an artificial flavor, but it is okay in iced tea. Not very fond of it in other beverages.;neutral
Tastes great. Cans are SMALL but look larger. Beware.;neutral
Okay rice - found it a bit dry, however. May have been the way I prepared it.;neutral
It's OK. Definitely not a soy sauce replacement. Flavor is very light and I find I have to use a lot to even taste it. I have issues with soy, so this will have to do for now.;neutral
green tea and half and half were good. Peach doesn't taste natural;neutral
Tasty snack.  But this is not the high quality chocolate you would get at some fancy chocolate shop.  Reasonable value for price.;neutral
Instructions for boiling work. Cast iron frying to make the noodles crispy doesn't work so well. Definitely have used this in a number of recipes;neutral
hoping this does well,, not in great shape when I received it;neutral
This is NOT Coleslaw dressing. It has a very strong distenctive taste of cumin seasoning. Should be good on something like a salad with avocados.;neutral
Can be eaten. Needs some other spicing choices.;neutral
Only bulk blanched almonds I could find. Compared to unblanched almonds, these are far less tasty. It might be the skin that imparts good flavor. The product is also quite expensive.;neutral
I intended to get Dark Magic and got in a hurry with several items being purchased at the time. It is okay, but I really prefer the Extra Bold Dark Magic. Just placed a new order for that.;neutral
There is always improvements to make in this area. Wish the chocolate was a better quality. I think that would help them taste better.;neutral
Ok for what it is. For me the only use is making tea.  Powdered form is better for me;neutral
Didn't like these very much.  My housekeepers little daughter liked them so I gave them to her.  She said they were really good.;neutral
Got it for like 11.50 for three boxes,(good price sad to say) but was supised to find it has NO fiber. On the plus side it has 6G of protein which is 2 higher than Cheerios so a 3 rating;neutral
The coffee itself is Okay. I think it is totally overpriced for little single serve packets. Honestly, its a little ridiculous & not worth it.;neutral
Not as good as I'd hoped, very very thin and hard to separate the 4 in a pkg. They tore and even lettuce broke through;neutral
Good Taste, But too expensive. Not great taste, like you would expect from Godiva. Not at that price! Was sent by Mail. Will melt in summer;neutral
Very good and strong peanut taste.  I don't know how it can be roasted and virgin, though.  Probably not good for you, but tastes great!;neutral
We didn't use most of them so I sent them to my son's house. I think my daughter-in-law liked them.;neutral
great taste - too many artificial ingredients;neutral
I must be spoiled since we grow our own basil in small pots.  This is okay but too bland and grassy.  You just can't beat fresh basil on your pasta -  there is no substitute.  I will not buy this again.;neutral
Flavor is okay, not my favorite. It's got a weird slightly fruity, yet minty taste, which isn't my favorite. A little strange. Pieces are very small.;neutral
This is a mini version of their regular shells and cheese. Everything is set for perfect mac n cheese. You just microwave the tiny shells for a few minutes, squeeze the cheese in and mac n cheese delight.;neutral
Too much crunch for me  difficult for my worn-down teeth.;neutral
Not as sweet as sugar. Caused abdominal distress. Subsequent to using learned that our body does not absorb this stuff. Took a week for my system to adapt. Still using it.;neutral
I like this coffee but can't justify the cost;neutral
"I wasn't that crazy about the flavor, but I was able to eat it.  It's better than grabbing a ""Payday"".";neutral
They aren't the worse but also not the best I've ever had. They don't smell or taste like fish if you're wondering. But more earthy. The texture is a little rubbery to me.;neutral
I didn't particularly care for this. But I think it must be me, because my son loved it. so it's according to your own personal tast.;neutral
These chips taste good but are really high in sugar and salt.  Not really a healthy choice if you are trying to cut back on sugar and salt in your diet.;neutral
Not what i was expecting.  Its ok if you need to replace your coffee with something with less gastric impact but it has its own unique taste.  Not bad but unique.  I need/want coffee.;neutral
They're Slim Jims.  They are what they are.  If you like Slim Jim products, they're fine, if not, then you won't.  Decent quantity for the price though.;neutral
Not totally crazy about it, but it is ok. Has kind of a sawdust quality that makes it 3 stars.;neutral
said it was made with peanut oil!  It was not!  cottonseed oil and the and/or other routine..;neutral
I thought that since these was not salt they would be a good purchase, however they have no taste at all.;neutral
Cooling effect of sweetener I am not a fan of;neutral
ok product but we prefer the radish sprouts.;neutral
Love it but seem to have trouble losing leaves at base even without over watering. Weird supposed to be so easy but managed to kill it with too much love.;neutral
"Works great, flavor is kinda iffy.

Would prefer a bar without coconut.";neutral
I prefer the box I received from the UK. It s from Twining.;neutral
Tasty item but again the nuts end up at the bottom of the can;neutral
Can't taste coconut - just tastes like plain coffee.;neutral
If you like your flavors to be smooth you will enjoy these.  I prefer something with a kick.;neutral
Was very disappointed when I got this I thought they were bigger. Too much money for these small bottles.;neutral
I love this stuff!  The jars had leaked some of the oil during shipping though.  Don't know if I would recommend ordering it but the stuff is great.;neutral
I like most Kind products but think these are dry and lack flavor for my taste;neutral
Good if you cook it with butter, quite awful without;neutral
The hot sauce is a little thick and chunky.  It is hard to get out of the bottle sometimes, even with heavy shaking.  Once it is out though, it is a nice smooth heat to it.;neutral
These are delicious but so not worth the $$$.;neutral
Good buy. Not sure it has whitened my teeth any. It isn't the original formula.;neutral
Pop tarts are pop Tarts and this is a flavor everyone approves of. However my complaint is with the shipment. 3 of the boxes arrived crushed and open.;neutral
"think of them as nut ""seconds""  under roasted and not well prepared.";neutral
almost as good as Lindt but I think it costs quite a bit more.  I will stick with Lindt in the future;neutral
Bought it as part of an Amazon Trial.  Adds flavor, but you need to use of a lot of the liquid for the desired affect.;neutral
I have been gluten free for a while and these would be good if they put less xantham gum int the mix. Too chewy.;neutral
OK but don't really taste like regular animal crackers.  Will I buy them again...unsure;neutral
This jerky was spicy and sweet as advertised and I enjoyed it very much. I gave it a low rating because of the price.;neutral
the gum part is good. the taste is gone quickly;neutral
"I'm not sure that I'd classify this ""flavor"" as caramel, but it's probably as close as you'll get for 0 calories";neutral
"A friend recommended coconut butter. Thought this would be more like ""butter"" in consistency but it's quite runny at room temperature. Can barely taste the coconut. Probably best for use in cooking.";neutral
I am not a fan of the flavor of these at all.  Definitely taste the fake sugar.;neutral
I have to try it again. A little does go a long way.;neutral
It's creamy, sweet but not too sweet, but not the best flavor of matcha. Maybe not recommended for beginners;neutral
Not as good as the super crema, in our opinion. It's good, but very dark and oily. Maybe not suited for an espresso machine because of how oily the beans are.;neutral
It is not as rubbery as regular gum.  So I really only chew it ten minutes or so.  It is kind of like having a mint.  Like if you want to get a bad taste out of your mouth.  The packaging is super cute.;neutral
not as creamy & delicious as walkers nonsuch, but ok;neutral
They taste fine enough, but they are too thick and hard for my taste. For the price, I think I'll stick with more commercial chips.;neutral
I absolutely love other Bob's Red Mill products, but this one was texturally off for me. Nice enough taste but meh, wouldn't get again.;neutral
The cherries are somewhat disappointing, they seem to be a little dried out.;neutral
Large berries of consistent size.  Low residual moisture.  I would have preferred them to be little more moist.  My biggest complaint is that the bag included two small stones.;neutral
Tasted very good, but a bit pricey for the amount you get.;neutral
This coffee is far too weak for me. The taste is acceptable but would be much better if the roast was medium or strong.;neutral
"Was hoping for more of a chocolate taste, but it disappointed me. It is a nice mellow tea and I add
chocolate flavored Stevia drops to deepen the chocolate flavor.";neutral
Mine isn't as green as the picture and after doing some searching the greener the more true to real matcha it is.  I feel like this might be  a lower grade matcha.  My first time trying matcha though;neutral
Stephen's powder is significantly better tasting and better value.;neutral
Got the wrong kind. Did not see quick cooking but it is organic so I am going to finish it! Good reliable company;neutral
"They lack the strong ""salmiac"" flavor that can be bought in Germany.";neutral
20 minutes is an awful long time to cook and stir it. I have yet to cook it where it is soft enough for my dentures.;neutral
I bought these thinking my kids would eat them... they do not taste very good. Would not buy again.;neutral
"All except the vanilla sandwich cookies, have become sweet balls of waxy dough!!
Average quality and taste.
Please don't change the vanilla sandwich cookies Grandma";neutral
I didn't like them.  Thin, thin filling.;neutral
Love stevia and it is the only sugar I put in my coffee.  However, these two bottles are very small.  Rather buy from Sprouts which gives you more for your money.;neutral
I like buckwheat honey and this one does the job. taste is good texture is good price is ok. try it;neutral
I had to add little salt to it to make it drinkable.  I've had worse, but this wasn't great.;neutral
It's good stuff it's just very weak for a good tea you need to use 3 pack in 1 brew;neutral
Candy is kind of hard....like it is going bad or something.  Let's see what the next bad is like.  Not giving up yet.;neutral
Seriously hardly any colored ones, 90% black pepper. Photo does not portray accurately.;neutral
"When I took the first taste of this salt, a flood of energy came down through the top of my head and I became instantly enlightened.

Actually not. It just tastes like overpriced salt.";neutral
I bought these to fill a gumball machine. The gumballs were too small for the machine. Nobody's fault.;neutral
wasn't particularly impressed or disappointed.;neutral
Good buy for the money however a few cups left a lot of grinds in my coffee cup.;neutral
Good coffee just not as good as Lavazza Rossa;neutral
"The traditional Walker shortbread cookie I enjoy. However not packed well enough to prevent the breakage of about half of the cookies.
It seems to be a frequent occurrence";neutral
This is a good tea to enjoy at night!;neutral
Using one bag for 8 oz of water, it is fairly weak. Using 2 bags with 10 oz of water, it has more body. The flavor is nothing out of the ordinary but enjoyable.;neutral
Tasty but very small and kind of expensive.;neutral
Taste Great, sorry this time they are to hard? Or I would give the usual 5 stars! Thank you;neutral
"Not all of these are the K-Cup 2; about a dozen thrown in that would not work.";neutral
Couldn't really taste the egg nog flavor.;neutral
Fresh. Good taste but too small for my air popper. I hold the popper slightly back until the popcorn begins to pop but these kernels are so small they still fly out.;neutral
"The mixed flavors container is better.
Too much of any one flavor is not good.
GRAPE sweetness is just right.";neutral
I did not personally care for the flavor;neutral
Have been disappointed with this shaker. The salt clogs up in the little holes.;neutral
Expensive -but an easy way to get the product.  No different from other freekah or cracked wheat of similar variety - but convenient.;neutral
Much smaller than expected.  The size of a vitamin pill.;neutral
Seems short on burgers. Only 4 or 5 per can.;neutral
just ok. seems like they are a bit stale;neutral
A low-carb staple. Tastes good any time. Which reminds me, I'm out.;neutral
Taste is okay, spicy and flavorful, just not a coffee I'd drink everyday.  Shipped in it's own package and came about a week after ordered as expected.;neutral
I missed the note saying it contains wheat.;neutral
Not too bad. Half the bag is comprised of unripe rosehips that lack the sweet/tart flavor and more of the tannic acid of a fruit picked too soon.;neutral
The Cranberry Almond + Antioxidants weren't a favorite of my boyfriend and I. We think there was too much macadamia nut in our bars so we weren't too fond of them.;neutral
I thought the flavor of these was pretty good, my kids ate them as well. My husband did not care for them. It was an easy cheap meal added to pasta, but likely won't buy again.;neutral
"Strong. But a little too harsh. Better strong coffees. Tully's! But good over ice.
Only ordered once. People don't choose it when they come over.";neutral
It just ok. We are not sure it does much.;neutral
This is not what it's said to be.  Just so-so.;neutral
These were tasty, but not like the bars;neutral
BE CAREFUL ,JUST BECAUSE IT IS SUGAR FREE ..IT HAS MORE CARBS THEN THE REAL CHIPS;neutral
did not look like the picture. Was thin cut bacon not thick. but it had a nice taste... almost reminded me of bacon I get in Lake Tahoe.;neutral
I have been to Pu er China and this tea is not as potent as the kind that I bought when I was there. It takes a lot more tea to create the brandy flavor that I love.;neutral
coffee was soooo weak. I'm not sure if its a keruig/dunkin combo but i was glad to give these away.;neutral
left a lot more uncooked kernals than other brands;neutral
Decent gift, but some of the flavors were too overpowering;neutral
The sheets are a lot smaller than I expected.  However, I like Le Veneziane pasta.;neutral
Love them, except for the honey mustard flavor. It's just not very good and we ended up with the entire box eaten except for those ones.;neutral
Love this product and have been using for years, however, I can no longer afford the rising cost of this;neutral
Great flavor, some stay pretty hard and chewy. I've had lots of grit in it, so I have to try to wash a lot before soaking.;neutral
Rather tasty but more salty and sugary than salty caramel flavorful, in my experience.;neutral
These cookies are good, but they have such a strong banana smell that I am aware of them every time I walk through the room.;neutral
Not flavorful enough for my liking, but better than average.;neutral
"My bad.  I didn't read that it said pretzel ""pieces"", unless I got a bag that had the wrong contents.  I got it with prime pantry and it was a bunch of tiny pieces, with just a few nuggets.  Not good.";neutral
I can't say that this did anything to clear up my son's cold, but he does like drinking a cup of it when he is sick.;neutral
DID NOT TASTE AS GOOD AS I EXPECTED;neutral
Fairly good, not perfect enough to reorder but itll get used up knowing my hungry cheese loving family! Decent, but Tostitos is a better cheese!!;neutral
Not bad tasting and quenches my desire for something crunchy. I don't like the fact that its apparently high processed as it has no fiber that I've benefited from.;neutral
"The flavor is okay.  I much prefer ""Paris"" flavor. and will stop trying new flavors.";neutral
"Not really much of a Peanut Butter Cup flavor to it. Tastes like all the other ""healthier"" peanut butter's.";neutral
54 K-cups were thrown into a brown cardboard box. I was not too impressed since I was giving as a gift;neutral
Good selection but not all work on the machine!;neutral
I am not sure about the taste but I don't like low calorie beverages in general. I purchached this for my husband. He loves the can drink, however the powder he is just ok with.;neutral
Taste very good .packageing very poor  Each bag was as much as50 percent broken up but ate them anyway  .will not order again as too many broken up;neutral
We buy the kcups of this coffee and recently I got a reusable kcup filter to use with this but the taste is different. Not sure how or why but we went back to kcups.;neutral
Very good flavor, but it doesn't last long.;neutral
I love anything chocolate and mint and these clearly had those flavors, but it was so sweet I ended up throwing the bar away. Now the Chocolate Peanut Butter 30 gm are good and filling.;neutral
This is my favorite company. I used all its product and i am satisfied . I always recommend other to these product. I will continue to do so;neutral
Average quality. I've had a lot better.;neutral
This product is OK, but it's not very sweet.;neutral
An ok group of samples, although way more flavored kinds than I was anticipating.;neutral
Again green mtg coffees are Goodman review for green mountain coffee;neutral
I was looking forward to this tea as i really like Masala spices.  This just is not that flavorful.  I will not order again.  I love most of Peet's coffee and tea............not up to their standards.;neutral
These are OK, flavor is very mild kind of like a cough drop. Have been mostly using them as throat lozenges so far.;neutral
Apparently, according to the recipient, these are second rate chocolates created for the purpose of not melting during shipping, which means they have more hardener and less creamy chocolate.  Sigh.;neutral
I like the fact it is only apples and apple cider, but would prefer something a bit more solid like jam or preserves.;neutral
It tasts good, but it too expensive.;neutral
Just ok. Some what of that imitation sugar after taste.;neutral
tastes like cherry cordial however the coffee is very light.  I use the small cup setting in order to get a stronger cup of coffee.;neutral
Not very good . In fact it's very inferior and they have a habit of sticking together . I wais really disappointed in this order;neutral
I'm not a big fan of Keurig Hot Chocolate. This is okay, but I think I'll stick to my coffee.;neutral
I didn't really care for the taste, so I will put it in with my morning smoothie.;neutral
They don't work with my Keurig 2.0 machine.;neutral
after just one I came to the conclusion that there was a one in 48 chance of breaking a tooth.  since the package contains 48, I decided to stop after two and a half.  otherwise good;neutral
QUALITY SOSO QUANTITIES GOODGOOD GOOD PRICE!;neutral
The sugar is good.  Unfortunately, one of the boxes had a broken interior bag so there was sugar all over the shipping boxes.;neutral
Beef stick is good, cheese is way too salty.  Be sure to eat them together.  Probably won't buy again.  A little disappointing, expected better.;neutral
More flavorful than some soda alternates but still only flavored water with some sparkle;neutral
A bit dry and too spicy for my tastes,BUT my husband LOVED them!!!!;neutral
I tried using it making a frittata... not so good. Should have purchased ONE box first.;neutral
i bought this because it was on sale  i didn't realize it was refined  we all love coconut  so we won't purchase a refined product again  guess i need to read more before i click to buy;neutral
No kick to this sauce. If you want a mild remoulade, this ones for you.;neutral
good coconut milk-not bpa free.  They are lower levels but no info claiming bpa free on can. Oh well take what you can get;neutral
not very impressed...  too light, too mild....;neutral
A nice guilt-free snack, which you can dress up by mixing with some greek yogurt or the like.  It's not the greatest salmon but for a round a dollar it's not bad.;neutral
Little pellets.  Kind of has a funny aftertaste that is not great.  If you mix it in with something you won't notice it.;neutral
OKAY PRODUCT  BUT PACKAGING NEEDS MUCH THOUGHT AND POSSIBLY RE-DESIGN;neutral
Don't over think your coffee, but what you like and leave the sampling to college kids.;neutral
It tastes ok. Not super.  Thin & runny, more the consistency of a marinade than bbq sauce.  I oscillate on whether I'll buy this again.  Hard to beat no calories...;neutral
"Good if you have nose block or sinusitis! Leaves a bitter after-taste. Need to wait long (since I ordered 12 packs) before I can go to the more ""conventional"" ones!";neutral
Good, but a little too sweet and overpriced.;neutral
I wouldn't buy this again but chocolate is one of those things where one size doesn't not fit all.;neutral
These are great when you want a chip that isn't made with unhealthy oils.  They are extremely pricey though so not something you would purchase regularly.;neutral
arrived as ordered, I like the flavor of item surprised it was so thin in consistency........but would try again.used in green bean casserole.;neutral
All canned chili leaves a lot to be desired. This is the best vegetarian chili I have found. It helps to add a little salsa when you are heating it up.;neutral
Although the honey sticks sweeten my beverages, I don't taste the cinnamon.  Also, the package is difficult to open.;neutral
this bouillon is more oniony then beefy. I don't like onions - I'm regretting that I have 40+ more packets. I'm going to try to find wyler's no-sodium,;neutral
I do not understand what all of the hype is about this coffee.  It is just overly priced store brand coffee.;neutral
Good flavor, but the crystals are HUGE.;neutral
It's ok. Not the best yogurt covered pretzel I've had. Wish I could have tried one bag...;neutral
I had several duplicate flavors in this order.  I have ordered this item before, with no problems.;neutral
Worked well.  Taste was just a little too strong for me.;neutral
These did not work as they were in my Keiurig 2.0, without my Improvising. The only one of the variety I really liked was the Death by Chocolate but that is my taste.;neutral
Not so flavorful. Will not order again;neutral
Just received the product so I don't know how it will work in recipes, but this is the first time I've ever purchased vanilla extract with sugar in it...was quite surprised to see it as an added ingredient.;neutral
The popcorn is good, but it is low calorie by being a very small serving.;neutral
I've had better, but not many good teas in K-Cup for this price. I continue to order it from time-to-time.;neutral
not much can be said about the ACV, my score is only based on the fact that the bottle was leaky upon receipt. The packaging was good but the bottle was leaky. The smell in the box was pretty strong.;neutral
Mixing rice crispies and raisins would be close enough to this- nothing special and for the price you can do this at home.;neutral
"TASTE GOOD, BUT OH SO HARD TO SOFTEN ENOUGH EVEN AFTER HOURS OF SOAKING, TO EAT

WILL NOT BUY AGAIN";neutral
Usually I highly recommend Eight O'clock coffee, but this one was to strong for me, If you like it strong this is the one for you.;neutral
These are what they've always been. However I wanted the banana flavored ones but instead there were peach flavored ones in addition to the other regular flavors! Boo I miss my artificial banana flavor!!;neutral
Not much flavor and a really difficult to chew texture.;neutral
Weird shape the hole punctures small and dribbles coffee out. but it tastes nummy.;neutral
It's okay. Not thick and not sure if you should actually cook with it more for like a dressing or top your meat after cooking. Not sure but not bad but loaded with splenda.;neutral
I bought these to make the Turkey Feathers on my kid's table Thanksgiving treats. They were delivered promptly and worked perfectly. The only downer was the price.;neutral
ranges from extremely nutty to slightly bitter. I like it with sweet tea or a touch of honey, plan to try to use it in some baking projects or on pancakes. Think of it as a very stiff barely sweet nut butter.;neutral
Tastes really good and you can hardly tell it's got stevia in it but it does hurt my tummy if you eat to much.;neutral
They came fast these cookies for my sons class but after school he told me they were very tough to chew it made me feel bad for his class and friends next time I'll stick with chips ahoy;neutral
Not as big as I expect a baking potato to be.;neutral
I didn't eat any, but husband said they were ok.;neutral
Was never able to try any of them due to hurricane destroyed all our food and we had to throw everything in freezer away.;neutral
Meh.  Not the cream soda I am used to.  Not sure what is different, but it is not my favorite Cream Soda.  One of my kids, however, loves this soda-stream flavor- it is her favorite.;neutral
thought more sodium meant more flavor but i was wrong.  sad that i have 28 more packs staring at me, waiting to be eaten.  but i won't give in... well only for those desperate times!;neutral
This didn't taste as well as other white cheddar seasonings we've bought before. It almost had a burnt cheese taste to it. We're disappointed in it to say the least.;neutral
Good for flavored coffee lovers.  We just like all the other regular coffees;neutral
A friend told me to try this and it is just average;neutral
It tastes great, but I find it a little too expensive.;neutral
Totally addicted to the cranberry almond. Cinnamon raisin not so much. Found them Dry without a hint of sweet.;neutral
"I just bought it to try it.

I did not like the taste.";neutral
They were OK but I guess I did not think they were great.;neutral
Try the variety pack to find what you like - I tried to share these but the textures were off-putting to most people.;neutral
Very nice but turns out to be expensive;neutral
"Good syrup but not enough flavor.  We were looking for that definite Maple flavor.  Quite expensive for being just ""good"" and not ""great!"".";neutral
I actually didn't like the small kernels and the smaller popcorn I'm getting. For the quantity the value is amazing but I probably won't buy it again;neutral
Not very sweet.  Kind of like the okay ones that were fresh and freeze dried.  I like them, though/;neutral
All four cans arrived dented. 3 Stars because these are my husband's favorite.;neutral
Tastes all right. The pieces were tiny though.;neutral
good product, if you like the taste-I'm going back to the supplements.;neutral
Can't get paste the texture.  To odd.  Not there problem, mine.;neutral
Trying to get used to green tea.. Cannot say I like it but I drink it ok for the health benefits it presumably offers;neutral
Just right.  Quick shipping/adequate packing/as pictured & described!!  Thanks so much!!  A little watery for my taste.;neutral
The bars taste ok, however when I received the package - chocolate had melted and re-hardened on the bar making the chocolate flaky and messy to eat.;neutral
Not for LCHF diets!! My dad liked them, but I couldn't eat them because of my diet.;neutral
Super expensive but worth it to me living in a small town where I have to travel to a grocery store;neutral
This one was sorta dry and not nearly as tasty as the chili lime.;neutral
Its okay, taste the same as chicken noodle;neutral
"Good, but if your into high end treats, this just doesn't meet that level. A tad grainy and it does not have that smoothness you might want.
But the children are oblivious.";neutral
Tasty but seems like more kernels than I would like that do not pop;neutral
they filled order quickly & it is just what they said in the add, not as good a taste as large liquid bottle.;neutral
If you need syrup that is unsweetened, this is a good syrup to use. It is not any worse or better then the kind you find in the store.;neutral
ok, a bit too much sugar, but otherwise, tasty with a strong ginger taste.;neutral
Didnt love it, doesn't really taste like Chai;neutral
These did not get the best review from my son in the Service.;neutral
The meat part tasted good but the cheese I did not like. My kids did like cheese;neutral
it's ok - i think they changed the recipe....something is missing now;neutral
Not very tasty. Directions would have been easier to follow if I spoke Japanese.;neutral
i wanted to try this for my family,hope i can find something similar without the high shipping cost...hope my family likes it;neutral
Not strong enough for me, but ok coffee. I like it very strong, like dark magic, or new.mans own. Probably just me.;neutral
Its good to add to things not as a drink it straght, lol.;neutral
I just can't get past that aftertaste. They served a purpose until I found xylitol.;neutral
It's grainy, but okay. I won't buy again mainly because of expense.;neutral
Not the best-- very sticky, to the point that too much of the candy sticks to the cellophane! Taste is just good, not excellent!;neutral
This was not as great as i expected. I can't taste the mango as much as the coconut. It has a bit of an artificial taste to me. It was ok but not great.;neutral
Like their other products better. But I tried them.;neutral
First of all, the flavor of the pancakes was very good. My main issue is the overall cost. The mix was $13. The for one batch you add egg, milk and butter. Very expensive pancakes.;neutral
I had a few different milk oolong teas. This one smell nice but when I brew it, it has only oolong tea taste. I will go for the Chinese one next time.;neutral
These are okay (a bit overcooked for my taste).;neutral
Convenient, but I like my homemade better.;neutral
These aren't that fresh and the nuts are flavorless.;neutral
"I find that I need to use a lot more of this stuff to salt popcorn and taste it like my old generic ""popcorn salt"" from the grocer.";neutral
It taste good, I think I like it more than the primal jerky, but the bag is small for the price. I know vegetarian stuff usually cost more but this is ridiculous;neutral
This tea tastes fine. It's a good quality (enough tea in the bag) but didn't do a single thing medicinally.;neutral
Not the fine cassava flour. Use it for breading or coating. Also for texture.;neutral
flavor is ok but after trying it, it just sat in the refrigerator and I threw it out after a few weeks.  We make sushi and rolls on occasion.  I guess we prefer making our own sauces from scratch.;neutral
It was okay I had bought the green bottles before liked those better;neutral
Has a strange taste, but nothing awful. Not what I expected, I was thinking this would taste more like hot chocolate, but had a watered down flavored coffee taste instead. Not for me, but might be for you;neutral
my husband  said the coffee is okay;neutral
Not tasty but caffiene free is what I like;neutral
very very salty. more than i had expected. We love salted licorice but this was to much;neutral
These are good, but need more favor and sweetner .;neutral
Too dark - leaves a bitter taste after drinking.;neutral
These are ok. Pretty small , and don't seem as healthy as i thought.;neutral
unfortuneatly  two of the cans ( of 12 cans) were  crushed a little. (  though crushed the crush didn't open the can so  the product was in acceptable condition.;neutral
arrived partially damaged and parts were dead;neutral
Childhood memories! Sadly they are no longer real ice cream but that frozen desert stuff.;neutral
Eh... tasty but very sugary! So typical to Starbucks!;neutral
30 % broken. crunchy and fresh. Worth the money;neutral
Not too sweet, fair flavor.  This is the first hazelnut syrup I have tried, and I will probably buy something different next time.  Looking for a richer flavor.  This tastes a bit bitter to me.;neutral
Ok for a once in a while breakfast with no grain - to pretend like I'm eating cereal.;neutral
good flavor, but not quite what I was wanting;neutral
Good taste, but kernels were a little hard.;neutral
"Noodles not so great; bases, sauces and oils are quite nice.";neutral
no bad. other flavors i like more than this. i miss the curry chicken flavor, but they haven't made than in over a decade i don't think. more the pity;neutral
Quality product and delivered as promised.;neutral
These are pretty ordinary cookies.......Toll House are so easy to make and cheaper ( by far) and better. Make your own.;neutral
I sold these in my vending machines. It tasted salty to me but my customers loved them as they looked better than other brands' ie Lays and Doritos.;neutral
Not a very strong flavor, but I really appreciate that it has flavor without added sweetness so I can add only as much as I want.;neutral
"THIS BREAD WAS OK...I LIKED IT BEST TOASTED  ...I THINK THAT I'M SO HOOKED ON ""BREAD"" THAT NOTHING DIET WISE CAN TAKE IT'S PLACE. BUT I'M SURE LOTS OF OTHER PEOPLE WOULD LIKE IT LOTS.";neutral
I'm a big fan of stash tea, Earl Gray is one of my favorite teas. I just couldn't taste much coconut. It's a good cup of tea though.;neutral
You guys really set me up I'm so thankful it really is nice i couldn't have asked for you to be kinder;neutral
A little to small a dice so that it gets mushy easily;neutral
The taste is ok which is fine as I drink these for nutritional purposes, not sipping. Hey - things that are good for you shouldn't taste good, right?;neutral
"I figure the folks at Planters said something like ""let's try it and see how it goes."" It doesn't go well; the vinegar/salt combination is great on potato chips but hasn't translated well on other foods.";neutral
ok, expensive, not right ingredients for me.;neutral
Good but many selections I did not like but found good ones to 're order;neutral
Inconsistent. One time I got one which are sweet and ripe, the next time it was far from ripe.;neutral
I have tried this mixture before...never had good luck getting a good soup out of it.  Some beans turned to mush, others didn't cook at all.;neutral
a lot broken dates..(( but taste good...;neutral
Haven't opened all yet...have opened 3 and they are ok , not great by any means , but ok...;neutral
These are very mild in taste.  Too mild I think, with very little taste of horehound.;neutral
"The product itself is great. I've used this brand for Thai curries and coconut rice for years.

Amazon's packaging of canned goods is atrocious. Other sites do a much better job packaging individual cans.";neutral
The gum is good in texture but I do not like so much mint in it.;neutral
Service was good but product does not taste as I expected.;neutral
I purchased this Ceylon organic Cinnamon, to help control my Diabetes. I am still attempting to figure out the best way to use it,so far I put a couple of Sticks in my tea. Too soon to say if I like it.;neutral
"Some yucky strange flavors. Overall, I feel like the flavor is not ""strong enough""";neutral
This box was a tad stale and does not pop completely in the microwave.  The flavor is good but I will not do this again.  I have been giving them to friends along with my opinion of them.;neutral
I am rating 3 because, as much as we personally hated them, we are sure other's are likely to enjoy the taste. The quality of them seemed fine. Packaging was fine. We just did not enjoy them.;neutral
they're sliced very thin, I prefer them thicker cut, and seem a bit sweet;neutral
Pink salt, pretty to look at. tastes like .....salt.;neutral
They have a lot of black pepper corns.  Too spicy for my taste.;neutral
The dark chocolate on these espresso beans is a bit on the waxy side, but that consistency may be necessary to get it to stick to the beans.  Good value in the 2 lb bag.;neutral
The taste is pretty good, but it has a processed fluffy feel to it and had some pieces in the bag had a gristly/fat feel to them that was unappetizing.;neutral
Ever since I got the Keurig I have bought all types of tea. This is a k-cup I will not buy again. It has no real prominent taste. Taste like what I would think cardboard taste like.;neutral
Our jar was just not hot enough, had almost no heat at all. I guess I'll return to making it myself.;neutral
a slightly more woody taste then I like but good to sip and enjoy.;neutral
Not near as good as Belvita! I won't be buying these again.;neutral
"I share the frustration of many date buyers with ""dry dates""..these are a 7 on a 1-10 scale.  They are, however, a good price.";neutral
I like the sweet and salty but don't care for the chocolate layer. Too messy. Probably won't get again;neutral
This really didn't work for me. Very salty and the lobster flavor was not to my liking;neutral
These nuts weren't as fresh as they should of been. Disappointed very hard...to bad cuz I buy alot of nuts & was hoping I'd be trying out many others;neutral
Good tasting product but they are sort of small. The chocolate is not very thick.;neutral
Not as good as a previous purchase. A lot is left unpopped .;neutral
I like the other curries better.  This one had a strange taste.;neutral
I'll give this 3 stars because I really did not like them - didn't taste like cream cheese with chives AT ALL but other family members liked them.;neutral
Contains carrageenan. Other than that, flavor was good;neutral
Mediocre, with watery gravy and stuffing.  Not much flavor, though the mashed potatoes are OK.;neutral
not going to be a favorite but it is ok for a change;neutral
truthfully, can,t remember why I ordered it.;neutral
Can't say much about the quality of the coconut milk as I haven't opened the cans yet but every single can was dented.;neutral
This come in handy when you are travelling - but you can make your own for much less money. Just put 2 tablespoons of chia seeds in pill bag and you are all set to go.;neutral
I cant drink energy drinks. Makes my heart race;neutral
It was alright.  TURMERIC has some good healing products.;neutral
I gave it three stars because although i love pretzels these were fresh and good but the container was 3/4 full and 1/2 of those were broken.;neutral
We bought this as a gift for our kids and they said it was ok.  They didn't rave about it like they usually do.;neutral
These k cups make very weak cups of coffee.  At 6 oz, the strength is adequate and the taste is fine.;neutral
Good taste but NO snap...more a chew. Will not reorder.;neutral
Great pretzels .... but unless you love fragments, recognize that shipping is not kind to this kind of product.;neutral
Not bad as far as K-Cups go but better flavor cane had a lower prices.;neutral
its ok taste, you can feel the difference between nespresso pods and this one, and  they don't label the pods and you have no idea which one is which. but price was affordable so i gave it a try.;neutral
I didn't really care for the taste, but coffee preferences are always so subjective.  Worth giving it a try!;neutral
The taste is good but it comes from China and I just don't trust their food products.;neutral
It's not as flavorful as I would like and there's no way to add more.  I might try adding vanilla to the cup.  I'm not sure if I'll buy again.;neutral
For the price its okay I guess.  Still terrible caviar though but can't expect to get good caviar for $4;neutral
I found the flavors a bit overwhelming and need to figure out the right proportions for my needs.;neutral
"This is not a bad tea; I like lavender scent in general, but this tea has a very strong flavor that I could not handle it. I mixed it with chamomile and green tea but still the flavor is too strong.";neutral
Constructed with a metal rim under the plastic lid. If I can't put the container in the microwave then what's the point of paying a premium for individual servings?;neutral
This made my pumpkin tea stronger but nasty after taste;neutral
Not a huge fan, but freshly made tortilla's made from this were tolerable. Needs to be sifted first. Lots of grit and fibers.;neutral
Its too small in size. So not that easy to eat. But tasty.;neutral
I've had to use more than I expected to get any flavor out of this.  The flavor is good when you get it, but it's a pretty pricey little drink.;neutral
Have never tried Pumpkin Seed Butter before.  A little disappointed, didn't really like the taste, don't know if it is me or the product.;neutral
I hated the flavor! But im super picky with vanilla flavors. My husband likes them though! Crunchy, flaky texture. Decent.;neutral
Some cups grains leak into the Keurig.  Maybe it is the packaging.  Coffee is good.;neutral
This chocolate is okay not as good as others. It's better if you add a little cream or canned milk to it. It has a richer flavor then.;neutral
I am not a fan. English muffins gluten free haven't been to my standards.;neutral
White pepper is great. this is a very small amount though;neutral
Too much lemon for my taste, but that's subjective, of course. I prefer the pure ginger with my own lemon.;neutral
For the price, this saffron is decent but it doesn't have a very strong, distinct saffron flavor that I remember from store bought saffron.  I probably wouldn't recommend it as a result.;neutral
Not very hot at all. Has a moderate kick but would no describe as hot.;neutral
Tastes like coconut.  Gives your jaw a work out.;neutral
They are ok, the flavors are pretty plain and the price is ok;neutral
Barely taste any ginger flavor. Good for mixing drinks. Prefer Canada Dry.;neutral
The coffee seemed a little dry as compared to other water processed decaf coffees.;neutral
I ordered this item for a friend as I do not care for Diet Coke. I can't give it five stars because I much  prefer Diet Pepsi.;neutral
not my favorite.  I got a while back and still have some;neutral
Interesting texture, kind of reminded me of rubber but easy to chew. Not sure if I would order again however, I would recommend if your interested in the product try it.;neutral
These were just MASSIVE. They tasted just so-so. If you want a real wow factor, go with these. Kids (especially boys) will probably love them and kids are not very picky about candy.;neutral
I like to drink flavored iced coffee on warm days and especially like a chocolate flavor. This was just okay........ has a funny aftertaste and I really couldn't taste the marshmallow very much.;neutral
Average coffee, but don't take my word for it. I am not an Amazon Vine member, just your average coffee drinker.;neutral
Ok popcorn. Not as great as some reviewers suggest. I got sick of it before I finished the bag. I have had better popcorn from the dollar store.;neutral
Surprised and disappointed that these are made in Thailand;neutral
Good but didn't make a lick of difference. Will not purchase again.;neutral
I love coconut oils. This one's a good oil for moisturizing. I personally use it for massages. I don't like the smell though. Thats the reason i never tried it in food.;neutral
Nice tea, just not great! Makes a cup quick and easy but is NOT cost effective!;neutral
The taste was great, but the berries had melted.  May order again in winter. If you order in cold weather you should enjoy flavor.;neutral
This relish has too much onion for us..;neutral
The flavor isn't for me....but taste is very personal. Seemed to be fresh and a good quality. Sandy;neutral
These are really good, but packaging is not so good as at least half of them are broken;neutral
Okay for some recipes, but a little too salty for most beef cuts.;neutral
"For the price, I felt that this pickle juice lacked character and body, two qualities I expected to find in a product that calls itself ""Premium."" I won't be ordering it again at the current price.";neutral
The product was damaged. Packing not good. A little old and stale.;neutral
Good enough to add to Paella, but not as a stand alone sliced.  Go for the good stuff then.;neutral
"The leaves are nice and green and uniform.
The taste is fine, but after brewing there's a white residue in the bottom of my cup.
What's that?";neutral
Convenient product but flavor sort of off turkey taste I expected;neutral
Honestly, very bitter coffee. I purchased because it is organic (even though, outside of U.S. hard to determine whether truly organic). I really did not enjoy the coffee.;neutral
The snacks were hard and very chewy. They were not soft.;neutral
it's ok. Pretty, but my family didn't really like the dried fruits.;neutral
The white tablets are completely bland no flavor at all the chocolate is really good and so is the powder.;neutral
Tasty, filling, a bit sweet.  Unfortunately, not suitable for diabetics:  too much sugar and too many carbs.;neutral
Have to scrape scale off before i eat.;neutral
"Tasty but a bit saltier than I'd hoped for.  Makes a bit of a mess (most edamame does; this also has bits of flavoring that come off on things) but yummy.";neutral
Not used to red lentils, cook up differently than the regular ones I'm used to.  Took much longer to soften than I would have expected.;neutral
There isn't a whole lot of sprinkles per section.;neutral
Like the flavor, unfortunately i didn't realize how small the packages were in the box.  Pay attention to sizes!;neutral
I think this flavor is trying to imitate Mountain Dew and it does a pretty good job.  I am not a particular fan of Mountain Dew but the flavor is okay with me.  Soda is soda.;neutral
This is an alright taste for a dark roast. Not for me though.;neutral
I was expecting a bolder, more flavorful taste and this coffee didn't deliver.  It didn't taste bad, just nothing special.;neutral
It's ok. Tastes just like coffee. Will buy again.;neutral
Smells delicious but the flavors didn't really live up their names. They nearly all tasted like just generic coffee.;neutral
lots of crumbs and cracked/broken cookies when arrived ~ I could not enjoy it;neutral
Has this product changed?  It doesn't seem nearly as strong and flavorful as the first time I bought it.  I am using 2 tea bags instead of 1 to achieve any flavor.;neutral
It's fair, nothing special in the flavor;neutral
Definitely one of the best brownie mixes I've tasted but the S&S price is no better than the price I would pay at the local Costco.;neutral
This is an okay flavor. The syrup is really runny. I don't drink the diet cola straight, but halve it with another non-diet flavor to cut the calories.;neutral
Taste OK...but took 19 DAYS to get here. So, good product, bad shipping policy, and I think that's part of what a review should tell you.;neutral
this is great but has a strong taste i don't like...;neutral
The cupcake makers must have missed one or more of the secret ingredients.  Not even close to Oreo cookie taste.;neutral
somehow worse than in their standard long cardboard boxes I have been buying for years;neutral
The grains are too small for my grinder and too big to just put into things.;neutral
It's OK! I'm a southerner. I prefer Bacon and Bean Soup Campbell's or homemade.;neutral
I buy this for the office.  I don't care for the flavor, but many of my co-workers say it's fine.;neutral
Tastes too sweet and has a strong apple flavor. Not as mild a flavor as one would normally enjoy. Sweeter...for ids.;neutral
It's cooking oil. It complies with the keto diet. It is more expensive than the basic cooking oils .;neutral
Too dark and caramely and sweet for us.;neutral
Good taste, but very tough.  I have had Black Jewel black popcorn before and it was so tender and sweet.  I don't know if it is a difference in the hybrid or if this was not very fresh.;neutral
My cats like another brand more.  Not quite sure why.;neutral
This blend of 17 spices seems very slightly sweet to me, although there are no sugars on the ingredient list.  OK as a general herb topping but not general-purpose, to my taste at least.;neutral
Product taste was mediocar. I like Lance better.;neutral
Not terrible, but tastes more like butterscotch than caramel.;neutral
This is okay and has a pretty good price.  But I prefer the taste of Madhava light agave more.;neutral
2 cans arrived dented, but they will be ok.  Watch it next time!;neutral
I know I should like these but they are only so good.  Paul Newman's Organic mints were better in side by side testing.  I will not go back to buying the chemical laced mints that I had been buying.;neutral
Very good for an inexpensive bagged tea. Not the best but definitely not the worst! And for the price you can't beat it;neutral
It's a great salad but too small. Didn't fill anyone up for lunch.;neutral
Good flavor but has a bit of an aftertaste.;neutral
I wish I had read the description better, this is a very expensive Stevia product. It tasted fine I we used it.;neutral
This is a pleasantly sweet jelly bean, but I think it smells more like cotton candy than it tastes like cotton candy.  Won't be buying this one again.;neutral
I don't eat added sugar they have sugar.haven't tried them yet since they have sugar. I wanted citrus taste not sweet. Price was okay size of bottles fine. But I wasted my money on something with sugar.;neutral
Super, super chewy. Tastes ok. But it is gluten free and dairy free and has no junk in it.;neutral
The flavor was okay but the texture was almost too moist for me.;neutral
"I have been using real maple syrup for many years.  I often try different brands and try to get a good deal.
This syrup tasted good, but I found it to be watery.
I would not buy it again.";neutral
Not too sure I'd buy it again--its ok but nothing that great. Have gone in a more natural direction with baking.;neutral
"Very expensive

Vegan

Delicious

Each peice is large (I purchased the salted peanut). Larger then an average M&M

Arrived in the Mail 4 days";neutral
That could be my fault though. I hardly ever buy or drink flavored coffee. Thought this might be good for guests and maybe it is. But too sweet for me. I like French roast!;neutral
Its not my favorite tea but its much better than some I've had. Light flavor, doesn't really quench my thirst though. Drank cold, was better hot but its spring not fall.;neutral
I wish this size was for the unsweetend too.;neutral
"Did not turn out as I expected.  I use a convection oven; which does the job but seasoning doesn't seem to coat that well.

Your mileage may differ...";neutral
Taste is OK but it is a bit lumpy and thus is difficult to shake out of even the largest holes in the cover.;neutral
Good Basic beans. I found there was a lot of chaff with these vs the other beans I use. The taste is very good, you just have a bigger job of chaff removal to sift off the bits;neutral
It is a very healthy type of cinnamon for sure, but the taste is not as strong as I would like.... a bit bland tasting;neutral
I prefer half and half but I can't drink it fast enough and before it spoils, so I use this instead.  It is OK and better than drinking my coffee black.;neutral
In my office some people were really excited about this, but after we got it, we found it hard to rinse the 'fishy' smell from it, but once we did it was nice.  Like little pasta bits.  Goes well with curry.;neutral
Nice texture and the flavor is great but it doesn't last very long.;neutral
They do not taste anything like what I had as a kid.  Too bad;neutral
I'm sure this is a great selection for someone but neither the children or I cared for them. I love the company just not this batch.;neutral
I think the caffeine in these is too high. My blood pressure always rises after drinking one of these. Don't think I'll be buying anymore.;neutral
Flavors are all tangy. It will take me a while to get through them , but I would re-order these.;neutral
"I looove veggie straws, but did not watch what I was ordering.  When did the manufacturer start ""messing with them""?  Ranch????  Aargh!";neutral
I usually like everything Kirkland makes. This stuff is ok, but it is very sweet.;neutral
did not taste the same as if you went to starbucks and had it make.  not at all what I expected.;neutral
I don't love this. It's ok but it's kinda lumpy.;neutral
Peanuts are good but I've had better Virginia peanuts and a matter of fact I question if these are true Virginia nuts.;neutral
.. its pricey and BTW it comes with a pump (they forget to mention that in the description) so at least you don't need to buy pumps;neutral
Just OK but for being only 90 calories it works to satisfy my sweet tooth.;neutral
The Town House Focaccia Rosemary and Olive Oil cracker have a good taste but my husband & I found them to be very hard like they were over cooked.;neutral
I don't like sugary drinks so I thought I would like this. No, needed a hair more sugar in it. Not much.;neutral
These were expensive and kinda tasted burnt, so I was a bit disappointed. I have had better chocolate covered espresso beans..;neutral
I don't like the taste- it's sad how many times I bought these hoping to fix them with tofu or chicken strips but just don't like them;neutral
I eat a lot of Special K and bought this one just to try a different flavor.  High protein for us diabetics and tastes good.  Still like the Red Berries better;neutral
too much sugar...please consider making a healthier option.;neutral
Flavor is very good but too much sugar.  Overly sweet and very sticky. More reminiscent of candy than jerky. did enjoy it tho;neutral
Decent coffee, but there's better out there for cheaper;neutral
Great taste and easy to make. It is a little salty, so I just pour the leftover broth down the sink.;neutral
Anxious to get the kick of spice promised by product details & reviews. Was sadly disappointed by the lack of spicy flavor. Didn't rate lower because they are soft & fresh. Sorry!;neutral
Hard to find cinnamon chips in central Ohio.  The quality was fine, but I found that didn't really care for the cookies that I made with these.;neutral
My daughter's favorite. Won't order again though because the order took several weeks to arrive.;neutral
seriously, i had higher expectations for these cookies;neutral
These are okay,  it they aren't might favorite.  They are healthy and if you're lucky, your kids will like them.  It's really just a toss up.;neutral
Very good flavored tea, Expensive though and I don't think it helped with any weight loss either.;neutral
Made crepes with just this flour and they tasted like cardboard. I think you can only successfully use this in a combination with wheat flour for good texture and taste.;neutral
We love hi-chew and I was excited to see this multi-pack.  Unfortunately, not sure why the flavor is different and not sure about the freshness of the product.;neutral
The sauce is a very good. However a single bottle wouldn't be enough marinade 4 large pieces of chicken.;neutral
Weak flavor...can barely taste any chocolate flavor. Use on smallest size cup on Keurig machine...I think it's 5 ounces. Doesn't need much cream or sugar;neutral
Not my favorie a little flowery tasting for me;neutral
This tea was purchased to settle an upset stomach and it does so, somewhat. But it's not a miracle cure, at least for me. It has a pleasant taste.;neutral
This used to be absolutely wonderful and was by far my favorite tea.  Two years ago the formulation changed and now it's just bland and nothing exceptional at all.;neutral
I do not love Peet's Guatemala San Marcos.;neutral
The marshmallow taste was almost too overpowering for me.  I got to eat one but my son must have really liked them because the next day he ate all the remaining pieces.;neutral
Its ok coffee but you get what you pay for. It's on the cheaper end of whole bean coffee. It gets the job done but you won't be blown away.;neutral
I don't like cappuccino like I thought I used to.  It is good though;neutral
Good, but not the best I've had. But then perhaps I should review the brewing technique. I understand this to be particular in its method...;neutral
Not as hot or spicy as it was suppose to be.;neutral
You will only get a bowl or two out of each one, so not worth the money. I would not repurchase.;neutral
these, like the larger size, are a little on the oily side.  the size is good if you need a little something sweet, but not a good value when packaged like this.;neutral
My girls liked the Ernie (pear/mango) ones better.  I got both, and no one wanted the Elmo ones.  We're down to one that keeps getting shunned.  Your tot might LOVE this flavor! :-);neutral
Not as good as Sophie's Kitchen but not bad.;neutral
While this is something you have to get used to, it is a healthy alternative to pasta that svaes your health in the long run! Give it a try!;neutral
Taste great.  But when received they were smushed;neutral
More nutritious than regular pasta - but the taste and texture is different;neutral
taste is phenomenal. price is more/less what it is in stores though.;neutral
Arrived on September 1 and the recommended use by date is September 30.  These BARS HAVE BEEN SITTING AROUND FOR A LENGTHY PPERIOD OF TIME.;neutral
These are good but a little on the sweet side.;neutral
I love the taste of the MILK, but I often find slimy bits of solidified soy at the bottom of the carton.  Pretty nasty.  One carton in my pack was half-solidified.;neutral
Good stuff. It was about to expire in 30 days though (so looks like I got an old batch).;neutral
Too salty for my taste. The proportion of meat vegetables and noodles were acceptable. Unfortunately the broth had too much salt.;neutral
The order appeared to be fresh but the nuts were tasteless.  Only good as topping for salad as greens gave it more appeal.;neutral
Takes longer than I expected to rehydrate;neutral
I was disappointed by the taste, not as tasty as the Ritter or Sarotti almond paste marzipan products. Made in Poland. Individually wrapped chocolate covered bites.;neutral
popcorn is pretty good, but may be stale? Is that possible for unpopped kernels to get stale?;neutral
The container was crushed when received.;neutral
I used this to add protein to baked goods. I tried to mix it for a sandwich but I didn't care for the taste nor the texture.;neutral
Was completely melted when received though!  So bummed.;neutral
It wasn't very good. I really didn't taste the coffee in these cups.;neutral
Disappointed as there were not a lot of flavored decaf cups.;neutral
does the trick,but have to be careful because of the sugar.;neutral
Having grown up in a hunting family, I grew up eating venison.  I'm not sure what this tastes like but it doesn't taste like the venison I remember eating as a child.  The strips are also rather greasy.;neutral
I guess I will never find the red pepper relish of my dreams or close to what Marshall Fields in Chicago used to prepare.  This specimen is o.k. for hot dogs and hamburgers - very mild without any kick.;neutral
I drank it ONCE.  I'm not too into tea, but I'll keep this in my cupboard for when I run out of tart cherry juice and am too lazy to go to the store.;neutral
Tasty but seems the shell is harder then I'm use too, rough on teeth.;neutral
I grew tired of the taste of this rather quickly. It would work well in a mixed drink and there are recipes for that exact purpose.;neutral
The first time we bought this I liked it, the second time the cups 'popped' and got coffee grounds in the coffee and in the coffee maker.;neutral
Tastes like most other packaged jerky. And when compared to REAL jerky it's awful-- just like other packaged jerky. Might be good for a camping trip.;neutral
"It is OK for the ""daily grind"" but iI was looking for a donut shoppe coffee for weekends.";neutral
"It's not bad, it's not as ""wow""ing as their brownie battler flavor, but still very good for curing a sweets craving that's low carb.";neutral
I like the corn nuts but didn't realize how very small the bags are, almost like a sample size.;neutral
I first bought this elsewhere and it was terrific.  Then I bought a bunch from Amazon and it was undated (despite their claim it had a current date).  I'm sure it was stale, so I'm lumping it.  VERY weak,too.;neutral
"The novelty is there, but the taste made my son gag. Funny for me of course ;-)";neutral
The crust was not like a pizza crust.. more like a piece of bread.  It was fine, but I won't be buying again.  I love their chocolate muffin mix though!;neutral
I don't like the way they taste.  Too sweet and makes my stomach upset after eating them.  I much prefer the cocoa loco bars.  If you have a raging sweet tooth though, they may be just right.;neutral
This is a good quality rose water.  I use it when called for in recipes and it is wonderful!  It even makes you smell good if you get it on you...hehe;neutral
I Love Pistachio's...but, unfortunately, have found a lot of burnt one's in my 1st 2 packs. Oh, how I hope that the remaining 3 live up to the brand and price:);neutral
We are dark brew lovers, but this just wasn't to our liking.  I can tell you my boss loved it, and he is a medium brew enjoyer.;neutral
I feel like I was cheated. Package only contained 4. However the taste is good.  I bought 2 packages and both had 4 ..not the 5 as advertised.;neutral
Good... redenbacher's always the same.  Yellow corn kernels are bigger than white corn kernels, but the white is more tender and tastier.;neutral
THESE JELLY BEANS ARE OK, BUT THEY DO NOT HAVE A VERY CHERRY FLAVOR.  I WAS DISAPPOINTED.;neutral
Instructions are confusing. Product is OK;neutral
There were packs of these that got her with being all broken up.  I mean bad.;neutral
I like the ice-breakers better.  This gum is ok, but the texture and the flavor I like less the ice-breaker ... So I will not buy again.;neutral
"Found some to be soft. It was like a guessing game, which one will be soft and which will be firm. Dad said they had a good flavor.
 Won't order them again.";neutral
Close to the Tower of London, but not quite.;neutral
Good taste. Tends to stick to teeth. Lots of sugar coating. Easy wrapper. If you need ginger would work. Not very pungent;neutral
YUM - for diet food. a little pricey it's small;neutral
High protein but very high in carbs. Needs a better protein to carb ratio if it actually is a weight reducer.;neutral
Tasty but tastes like fast food.  I add nuts and fruit to it.  Easy for a quick breakfast.;neutral
Meh. It's instant coffee in little single serving packets. It served a purpose when I was on vacation in a camping-like situation, but I wouldn't drink it otherwise.;neutral
Not strong or bold enough for me. I expected more.;neutral
cookies are good but came all melted and  broken in  small pieces;neutral
"I did not enjoy the taste of the coffee so much; it was not nearly so robust as I expected and did not compare well to other decaf coffees I have tried recently.";neutral
Flavor was not very noticeable, but it smelled wonderful.  Their chocolate glazed donut flavor is much better in terms of having a flavor and even the smell was much stronger and pleasant.;neutral
Great quality and packaging. It was just sweeter than I prefer for macaroni salad.;neutral
Not bad. I'll try the double bergamot  next time.;neutral
Some where very hot spicy to much for me. Those that warn't  spicy were good.;neutral
The candy shell is rather thick. I prefer a thinner shell but they did all get eaten!;neutral
Too hard and will be used for cooking.;neutral
I would rather have a specific one rather than the variety pack..  Also it was not so easy to dispense as the specific ones.  Otherwise they tasted good.;neutral
These caramels are extremely hard to unwrap. The quality is just ok.;neutral
Not at all what I expected. Wanted more flavors from these drops like from the movie grave of the fireflies - I have tasted much better fruit drops in tin cans before. These are just average taste.;neutral
The taste was unusual but edible i do not how to describe the except to say i was disappointed at the price.;neutral
Too weak for my taste. Good if you like weak, lightly flavored coffee.;neutral
All the bags had stale chips. Our money was refunded. I have ordered these before but this is the first time I've been disappointed. Leery about ordering again.;neutral
We expected Honey Wheat to actually have a taste, but this particular bread came out rather bland. It's not a bad bread, but we'll be looking for something else for next time.;neutral
Only Disappointment was Discontinued Amazon Fresh;neutral
"i really enjoy the flavor of this coffee mix, bought it @ work thought it would be cheaper to buy for home, NOT true; 5 g to 1.5 fl oz is not cost effective";neutral
It's okay and will probably buy again but the clear for me seems harder to get the sweetness right. I have several of the flavors and like them better.;neutral
A viable alternative to this 100% coconut is to take shredded coconut and blend it with warm water, then to filter out the coconut particles. You'd save a lot of money, and still have 100% coconut milk.;neutral
I think it is priced a little high, Tastes okay.;neutral
I buy this for my husband who says he thinks it is good.  I find it to taste like DECAF coffee.;neutral
Unfortunately - I didn't read thoroughly enough.  Not a good amount for the price.;neutral
This is a nice healthy cereal but its too heavy for someone with a sensitive stomach.;neutral
This is okay but the eggs are a bit bigger and not as delicate.  The price is good though the product is below average.;neutral
I bought two different kind of rooibos teas and sadly this one is just by far not that good . Aroma very soft I would have liked it a bit stronger and a bit more of Vanilla as well in taste.;neutral
Flavor is good but it is dry making me thirsty.  This is listed as Sweet and salty.  Didn't notice either.  Just that the coating was dry.;neutral
These aren't as flavorful as the ones I got from Barnes and noble, these seem a little stale.;neutral
It taste like coffee but do not use in a expensive coffee maker!;neutral
If you drink your coffee black you might be able to drink this weak coffee. I had to go buy some instant Folgers to add to each cup since I purchased this.  I will stay with Rio grande or Folgers.;neutral
Ok but compared to Starbucks, need I say more;neutral
Cant beat the price per ounce, but it's so processed it makes you not want to finish it. Several pieces contained extreme amounts of silver skin &/or fat.;neutral
"Pretty good flavor, but not very soft. I guess it's the price you pay for sugar
free....";neutral
A bit stale tasting even though it was in date. It's discontinued so on to finding another favorite.;neutral
I was so excited to try the Hodgson brands. They bake up great in my bread machine, but the bread is a bit bland and very heavy textured. Won't buy again.;neutral
Very good product. Deserves 5 stars but expiration date is too short.;neutral
I have to agree with others in that the taste is a bit much.  I can't eat them, but my son likes them.;neutral
You are paying for the tins, which are nice but can likely purchase almost half the cost at other retailers albeit in festive cardboard decor.;neutral
Very fun - be careful on your selection.;neutral
"One bag was great the other was all stuck together, not sure it will be eatable as I have not opened yet. https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B0012VSXIM/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0
Not sure if it got wet or hot.";neutral
These are ok but not as tasty as some of the other Sahale Snacks.  The nuts are good but the other pieces in the product are not.  I would rather just get the nuts alone.;neutral
Good but not great, compared to the local candy store offerings. I still ate the whole bag in two sittings, but that might be more of a reflection of my gummy addiction.;neutral
Did not compare to yogi Tea would not repurchase;neutral
Hicory flavor tastes fake and leaves an aftertaste;neutral
No discernable duck flavor.  You are better off saving the turkey fat the next time you roast one;neutral
Decent, it's coffee. I'm not particular in my coffee choices, so this works for me.;neutral
"not the best ""cleanser"" I have tried but it did taste good.";neutral
Pricey but tou can tell a difference;neutral
Very small bag, but more flavor than other types I tried. Good tasting, not too salty. The sunflower seeds are a lot smaller than other products, don't know why.;neutral
Sorry, we are not crazy about the taste of these patties.  We are going back to York.;neutral
I ordered this becuse I was running out of room in the fridge.  For $9.00, its the size of a Coke bottle.  Hardly worth the convenience.;neutral
Amazing chocolate!! Taste is wonderful, sooo happy because of the sweetener, BUT IT HAS SOY!! Soy is soo bad for you, I'm sad... Please consume in moderation;neutral
Good but weak if you use the large cup setting.;neutral
Smooth tasting, but I like more body.;neutral
Arrived damaged! Had a slit towards bottom of bag. Seems like a great product thou.;neutral
Got this as a free sample with an order.  It was OK-I'd buy it if it was on sale, but it was nothing special.;neutral
Had an odd flavor adn were kind of dry.  Must use up quickly.;neutral
Have ordered this candy over the years but not this size. Up to 15% of the candies were crushed together. Not good.;neutral
tasty, but a bit too sweet.  Less sugar next time?;neutral
Good but did not really taste like raspberry.;neutral
not very good. the taste disappears after 2 minutes;neutral
Okay, but doesn't taste like werthers candy.;neutral
One of the cans had a cut in the bottom and all of the juice had run out... threw that can away as was afraid to use it... will reconsider getting this brand in the future...;neutral
Nice, but the truffle and porcini salt steal the show.;neutral
"I was disappointed in these cookies, the taste was off, and they crumbled to easily, most of the M&M's were off
I think the elves need to improve this cookie.";neutral
I used it for one recipe and I doubt that I will use it again.  I couldn't tell much about it in the recipe I used it in.;neutral
I ordered these and expected them sealed. But two of the three were opened already. Nothing was eaten, but they were not trusted after that.;neutral
Its overpriced and the taste is comparable to food to live organic cashew nuts, you get 4 pounds for the same price!;neutral
"I had high hopes for these.  I love Creme brl&eacute;e.  I gave them a try.  They are not bad.  There is nothing wrong with them.  But they are not anything I would go out of my way for in the future.";neutral
It's pretty good , but something in it is just a little too spicy.;neutral
I don't know if the fact that they were delivered melted and had to be refrozen but they taste a bit chalky and play-do y;neutral
Not great either.  It's hard to taste the blackberry blossom (I know it's a subtle flavor, but even still).  I've had other flavors of blossom honey, and you could taste the fruit more than in this one.;neutral
i love the raisin type better, but i wish it was less expensive;neutral
These are good. Great snack or to throw in lunch.;neutral
looks more fun in photo than it is in real life.  box is cute..  candy does not fill it up as much as shown.  Just okay...  could do your own for much cheaper.;neutral
Won't buy again.  It has an aftertaste...;neutral
The ones that I received seemed a little stale and not as flavorful as some others that I have had.  I love licorice wheels in both flavors red and black but the fresher they are, the stronger they are.;neutral
These throat drops are OK.  I'm a licorice fanatic and these drops are not as good as other brands.;neutral
The flavor and the color are not the same as the paella I had in Barcelona! It is a yellowish color, not reddish. I guess there is only a tiny trace amount of saffron, if any.;neutral
Pretty weak flavor considering the high price.;neutral
Heavy on a brief mustard flavor and intense heat. Not much else. Not a favorite;neutral
This seems to be a good product, but is expensive.  I already use some buckwheat, and am now using straight chia in with my morning cereal.  Good nutrition and cheaper.;neutral
I had typed in the gluten free white cheddar ones. And that is what I thought I was ordering. When they got here they were not the gluten free ones. Was disappointed.;neutral
Just ok.  Too sweet.  Husband likes.;neutral
Taste was good but had loads of hard bits that got stuck in your teeth;neutral
This Ghee tends to separate and liquify.  You'll want to refrigerate it.;neutral
These have a rubber-eraser type consistency, and are either pretty flavorless (the red ones) or have an unpleasant taste (the yellow ones) that is NOT reminicent of fruit.;neutral
"Not the greatest.  Just okay.  Was a little disappointed with the lack of taste.  But  still,
 I am glad it has no preservatives.  That is very important.";neutral
The flavor is good but the jerky is too wet. Its so wet that the jerky is clumped together in a large ball at the bottom of the bag.;neutral
I tried it for a while but decided I prefer a spicier product.  This is to sweet for my taste.  If they had a pepper turkey product I would try that.;neutral
Taste is good, but it's not very crunchy.;neutral
I found the flavor lacking. It was bland. I'd much rather have a good packet of nuts or original trail mix.;neutral
Good product, nice variety of flavors.;neutral
These aren't very good to eat as a snack because they are very dry. I put some in a pancake and that worked better.;neutral
Lightly flavored . You really do not taste the mango their super fruit flavored are much better. Would not get it again;neutral
Didn't notice that I got any energy boost or anything. added flavoring sweetener and such, it's ok. Not especially what I'm used to. Just wanted to try it.;neutral
This is a very tasty soup, but it has a VERY high sugar content for a tomato bisque. Beware if you are watching your sugar intake.;neutral
"It's ok as a sweetener. It does create a ""zing""; however, the value is great for me.";neutral
nice variety... with no decafs which is a plus;neutral
Bought these for my grandson's lunch. When I asked him if he wanted me to reorder them , he said no. Enough said;neutral
Salt is good. Only issue I have is that is is not very course, so it does not look that great in the grinder and it does fall through since it is already small. Not really that white or clear either.;neutral
For some reason I am pretty sure I ordered liquid pectin but got this. Its still on my shelf because powdered pectin doesn't seem to work as reliably for me as powdered.;neutral
It's ok.  The flavor is potent and perhaps is best if you drink low quality coffee and want to cover up some of the flavor.  It is best used in small doses.;neutral
Standard shortbread cookies, better than Girl Scout Cookies (Trefoils??), but not as good as Walker Brothers.;neutral
It is full of rice, and not much else. Take the time to make it from scratch. This may disappoint you if you had a real taste for chicken tiki masala.;neutral
good coffee but pricey.  I could not tell any difference in my body over other organic cofees at 1/2 the price;neutral
This is a little sweeter than I expected but my husband loves it.;neutral
This stuff is just ok. Healthy yes but weird texture.;neutral
IBS I don't think this is a good idea for us...;neutral
A Very Average Panettone, mass produced taste;neutral
Very easy and a great substitute for mashed sweet potatoes.;neutral
It's an expensive way to buy these but really convenient if u don't live close to a store that stocks them. At some point tho u have to make a trip because u can't recycle the capsules by mail.;neutral
the candy a good buy for quantity and tasty!  the only problem is I like a strong taste of flavor and less sugar taste this was reversed.;neutral
too expensive, but tasty is so so, and it is very convenient!!;neutral
it is OK taste, but the packets are inconvenient. Too bad they don't make cubes.;neutral
Great flavor, but it doesn't last long enough.  Gluten free.;neutral
Love all the flavors except the Apple Pie ala mode one.;neutral
Was disappointed the bags have no string and tag attached, otherwise okay.;neutral
No pudding texture at all, vanilla is sooo sweet i couldn't even drink it, The only ones I liked are the chocolate flavor;neutral
Normally these are awesome, this was the first time I was disapponted. Hopefully this is a one time thing. Probably should send back and give them another try;neutral
Taste is great but watch out for pits and pieces of pits.;neutral
a bit too something for my tastes....like some sort of dried salty powder was added in...maybe it is suppose to be like that. I would not buy again. However, several of my friends loved them.;neutral
These are OK.  Not quiet like the old Brach's.  They are gummier and have less sugar coating.  The individual packaging is hard to open.;neutral
loved the asian, italian creamy tasted fake,Chipotle ranch did not taste like ranch but it was delicious.;neutral
The taste is fine but i found green tea and honey worked better, or ginger tea.;neutral
OK for vegetarian stuffing, but otherwise I much prefer Stovetop for taste.;neutral
"the processed flavor isn't so great but it was a perfect cheese to take camping nothing better than grilled cheese sandwiches .
I recommend for camping this cheese";neutral
Good taste but over priced as I recollect.;neutral
I thought I would like this more than I did.  Won't be buying again.;neutral
Some of them didn't work with Keurig 2.0 and I got a lot of coffee grounds in cup;neutral
Not flavorful like other Torani I've tried;neutral
I was thinking 1 lb would be a lot more than what it actually came out to be. Especially since starch is somewhat light, and since it was $8. I wish they sold this in larger quantities.;neutral
Good for sandwiches, bad for anything else (don't make french toast);neutral
General fruity flavor, nice texture. Gum wears out after about 15 minutes. Nice for a trip when I wanted to give the kids a cleaner version of bubble gum.;neutral
I really like all of Bob's Red Mill products, including this one. For the price you can't go wrong for organic beans.;neutral
These pancakes taste good, but they don't hold together well. I make the whole boxful and freeze the leftovers. They fall apart when reheated.;neutral
warning on top of shot says max 2 daily??? i put 2 in my regular cup of coffee, no affect;neutral
A bit too expensive for me.  The product is okay.;neutral
Not a great assortment but work ok. Little off the bveaten track flavors......;neutral
Has a sour after taste. Not awful, but I was hoping for more of a sweet than sour.;neutral
I love tea, especially Oolong blends. This is a very good oolong tea, but not as good as a straight oolong to me. Oolong is wonderful nice and hot!;neutral
Taste and texture are pretty good.  But insanely over-priced for the amount you get.;neutral
Taste good but it gave me stomach ache like some other soy products did.;neutral
I had great expectations for this olive oil, which colors my rating.  I found the flavor a little off - maybe it had been sitting in a warehouse too long? - and so I don't use it much.;neutral
My family loves these, but we will buy at Costco only- I was there yesterday and these are half of Amazon's price. That's a really good profit I will not pay Amazon.;neutral
Price WAY too high for what you get, and due to static cling, can't even get them all out, over half stick to the inside of the already ridiculously TINY little compartment!;neutral
OK flavor - would like stronger vanilla and less additives.;neutral
Not great taste...Will try a packaged brand..;neutral
Tastes good but the outer two cookies separate when dunking in milk for a few sec.;neutral
This product tastes a bit chalky but it is better than most protein powders. It mixes fairly well. I add it to yogurt and to smoothies for a protein boost.;neutral
Even with butter spray, etc.  It is powdered cheese, so what's not to like.  We will use it up but might not order again.;neutral
Nice. Yet, I thought it'd be more rich in flavor.;neutral
The Gum Really wasn't anything special okay for the cost of the 10 packs - flavor was okay and it lasted average;neutral
These are really salty, which is fine with me, but others may found them too salty.;neutral
Some of the flavors were okay and some were not.  If you do order these sodas do not expect them to taste like regular diet sodas as they do not.;neutral
Jury still out.  Not overly impressed so I guess I'll keep looking for my favorite coffee.;neutral
I must've made that the product tastes great! But do be careful with the nutritional value, it has 10 g of fat and 9 g of sugar !!!;neutral
"Less calories and less fat than regular Ramen, that's why I buy it.
Tastes good, I add chopped vegetables and meat.";neutral
Got this because it was low on weight watcher points but it is too sweet for me!;neutral
They are good,  I was expecting a little sweeter taste. Still good though;neutral
Good coffee but not nearly the best Ethiopian I've had. Average;neutral
The recipe on back says makes 2 servings but I could feed a family of  8 with how much this made. Cut ingredients in half!;neutral
Nothing much to say - too salty and not enough sesame. Taste more of flour than the sesame. Won't be ordering this again.;neutral
mixing with rice and corn flours to stretch them and pump the volume you could say I guess an it seems to work;neutral
Fresh and sweet. Not as flavorful as hoped, though.;neutral
Strong, clear flavors. Don't care for many of them, however. No softer than ones I've bought in the US;neutral
Not very interesting for espresso. Ok in my french press but will not buy again;neutral
Tasted good, a bit more oily than expected.;neutral
Good tasting nuts but not as good as other brands we have tried. They seem to have a strange taste not found in other brands we have tried.;neutral
Didn't have any flavor, it did look like 'blue meth' for our Breaking Bad party, though.;neutral
Too strong for my taste, I will try something less bitter in the future.;neutral
These are ok. They still in clumps and the flavors are a little strange. I miss real jelly beans that is why I thought Id try them.;neutral
Taste horrible! Not worth the money!;neutral
Too creamy.  Much, much, much cheaper at the local Trader Joes. $1.99.;neutral
average and useful but if you do much pickling you're going to want your own mixture;neutral
Didnt realize how small the package was.  It barly filled my pepper grinder .  I should have paid more attention to the product size;neutral
good but you can get the chocolate cheaper at trader joes or any other places like that.;neutral
"Same as the active ingredient, but I'm still not sure.  Smells like chemicals but from ""Culinary"" source.  No ingredient list or nutritional values.  Hmmm?";neutral
super suger---bet 1/2 weight was sugar--like candy;neutral
The product comes in varying sizes within the package which makes it harder to obtain a serving size.  It is a good way to get your fat macros in though.;neutral
Not chili. Mostly water with some beans and very very very small pieces of meat with no taste. Dont waste yout money on this rip off.;neutral
Delicious, this is the cheapest way I've found to buy them. Wish you could buy in bigger bulk to save money;neutral
I was hoping to find the mint brussels but decided to try these.  Very bland but I do have to commend you on the fact that cookies were in tact. I'm finding shipped cookies are always broken. Bravo!;neutral
I did not like this flavor at all. Hoped it would be like cream soda...NOT. I gave it away and they all loved it. Went to a good cause. Going back to water for me.;neutral
Overall, the product was as expected - this is our favorite mayonnaise. The price fluctuates so its worthwhile to keep an eye on it and order when the price is reasonable.;neutral
If you have ever had a dum-dum enough said;neutral
No one complained, but neither was anyone impressed with these nuts.;neutral
Nothing special, not worth the money.;neutral
A little watery with not  so much corn .;neutral
I don't know why this was so pricey. It's just butter.;neutral
A little overpriced compared to Korean supermarkets..;neutral
OK, IT IS WHAT YOU SEE IN STORES. REGULAR CRACKERS WITH SALT.;neutral
A bit high in calories, but oh so convenient!;neutral
These are good simmered with a little honey, but to eat like this they are pretty tough and flat tasting.;neutral
Bought this for the kids and grandkids as a blast from the past.  You know what?  They aren't as good as I remembered!;neutral
I love this product but many of the patties arrived squished and leaky.  Maybe they were place too close to some heat source.  I have ordered the patties before without any problem, however.;neutral
This was so....so....but I love the sweet potato pop chips;neutral
Good but not too tasty as I thought it would be;neutral
The product is great, but several cans were damaged in delivery.  I discarded the dented cans for concern about contamination.  Otherwise, I would have rated with 5 stars.;neutral
Really not that bad.  Tastes like chili but has a gritty texture. Could use more beans.  You can probably dress it up with extra kidney beans some fresh tomatoes and green onions.;neutral
Not Uber flavorful at least compared to store bought black peppercorns;neutral
Pay attention to the Zero Calorie because that is what it taste like.  If your good with the diet tea taste this is for you.;neutral
Good cashews, but you can barely taste the pickle flavor. I won't be purchasing this product anymore.;neutral
"Not delicious, but so much better than doing without fresh made coffee every AM, as I would have had to do to avoid too much acid due to GERD.
I plan to keep it in stock.";neutral
I'm relative new to sugar free syrups & tried this one hoping I'd like it based on the reviews, but I'm not a fan.  The flavor is much lighter than I expected & the product has an after taste.;neutral
I thought I was purchasing the double hot chocolate (natural and few ingredients), this is for cold drinks and I won't be using it during the winter--it tastes okay but might taste better for cold drinks.;neutral
Actually not too bad for a canned product...especially if you add a little BBQ sauce and mustard. Will be in my hurricane survival kit for sure!;neutral
It made my cheddar cheese taste very calcium-y,  i'm not sure I'm going to use it again.  I don't know if it's this product or all products like this.;neutral
they have an occasional bitter nut.  We reported this to the company and they went us a new bag.;neutral
It is fine but not as different as we expected.;neutral
If you want to pay a ton of money for the smallest can of mayo, this is the one for you. Good quality though.;neutral
Was way too smokey. I know ghost chillies are smokey by nature but this was too much. I did not like it, but it was spicy, which was what I bought it for.;neutral
Tastes a little bit eggy and the texture is grainier than I prefer but it's good if you don't have time to whip something macro friendly up on the fly!;neutral
i tell ya i just am not impressed. i had hopes for this being watkins and all but to me it is the same as the stuff i buy at the grocery store. o well;neutral
I guess I expected this to be a white chocolate with peppermint flavor. It had rather gritty pieces of candy cane that I found unpleasant...others might not.;neutral
Unfortunately, this is not the best dark roast bold coffee I have ever had. I was not impressed with the flavor.;neutral
These peppers were very dried out and added no perceivable flavor or heat to any of the dishes I added them to. They looked nice.;neutral
A bit on the pricey side, but a good alternative to regular water. The blackberry taste doesn't hit you until after you finish a drink.;neutral
Good product but package is only 1/3 full.  I would not buy it again for this price!;neutral
tastes great but does not make me relaxed/any sleepier;neutral
I think these tacos were okay but they did break really easily. I thought they were also bigger in size but they actually have to bags of them in the box so they are small.;neutral
Tasted like muling spices in chocolate.  It must be an acquired taste.  I enjoy muling spices in wine, but it somehow offends my palate in chocolate.  3 Stars because I think this will be a love or hate item;neutral
OK everyday coffee.  I tried it and drank all of the cups but wouldn't order it again.;neutral
This is coconut oil, nothing more. I got the impression it was something different, but it's it just plain old coconut oil.;neutral
These are ok, but the sodium is too high for me!;neutral
Small amount for this price, but it tastes of strong licorice.;neutral
Didn't really hold it's flavor very long but was tasty while it did;neutral
It is too watery - theri refrigirated product is thicker. But it is ok...;neutral
I prefer the neutral flavor Raw Protein.  This one mixes up a little thicker than the neutral one.  It also uses less liquid - 6 oz vs. 8 oz.  Won't be buying this again.;neutral
Fairly potent flavor, no noticeable difference than ust drinking cheap green tea...;neutral
I like the taste of this chocolate, but it comes in very thick 'log-like' pieces which are very difficult to break apart. Will keep looking for another brand.;neutral
These take quite a bit of time to make and are not really as tasty as they look on the box.  They are gluten free, but not special.;neutral
Not overly sweet...good for an addition to other sweeteners when baking;neutral
Was looking forward to trying the Blueberry flavor. They are okay if you like a very light coffee. Flavors do not really come thru. I'll stick with my Green Mountain Wild Blueberry.;neutral
Has a slight Kona flavor but rather pricey.;neutral
Need to improve their package on jar so it is sealed and tamper proof. Refrigerate as soon as received or you have a dripping mess.;neutral
Taste great. Over half arrived broken. Not good if your using for a display.;neutral
I normally have my coffee black, but thus needed sugar and cream. Too earthy.;neutral
I put these in my morning smoothy, cereal and baked goods.  I will order them again when the last package us gone.;neutral
The down side is that it doesn't stay creamy.  Mine is all powdery and worthless except in a smoothy.  I actually loved it when I first got it and was great on toast.;neutral
It is a nice light green tea.  Has a slight bitter aftertaste and it's not heavy on tropical flavor.;neutral
"Ok, but only 12 ounces.  Have tasted better ""pumpkin"" coffee.";neutral
Not exactly what I was expecting, but it is okay.;neutral
Okay but nothing special.  I prefer Pamela's cookies by far! These are large, which means less of them. They just didn't have a lot of flavor for me.;neutral
Used yo be my favorite but doesn't taste the same since the color changed.;neutral
Found they were a little bland and dry.  Was disappointed overall, but gave them to our neighbor kids and they seemed happy with them.;neutral
Didnt expect it to be as spicy as it was - have not tried it on meat but tasted it on my fingers.  Traders 21 spices are also good;neutral
We found the taste overpowering. But definitely smells blueberryish when brewing!;neutral
Sorta of bland.....other flavors in this band are a whole lot better!;neutral
Good strong coffee but a little overly strong for my taste... but maybe if I make it a bit weaker it will last longer.  Harsh finish if made according to instructions.;neutral
It's okay. Kind of harsh. Strong. But it says, Extra Bold, so there you go. It was a free sample.;neutral
Doesn't have that deep Bold Flavor that I thought it would have. Not a bad coffee but not  what I expected;neutral
Too many items I really didn't want.  Tried a lot of different flavors but really I like a good coffee.;neutral
"I have purchased this product in the past and was pleased.  The most recent package no longer states ""raw"" in the ingredients description,  just organic cocao. Taste is fine.";neutral
I got these for party favors and they were well packaged so they didn't break and arrived quickly. My daughter didn't like them though and she will eat pretty much any candy you give her.;neutral
Nice flavor if you like dark/strong flavored coffee.  Fresh/oily beans.  Smell of coffee when bag first opened was very pleasant.  Will try other coffees and may come back to this.;neutral
Would not buy again. It's not organic. Purchased based on the fact I thought the matcha was organic.;neutral
"Not all that...kind of like...bacon. Thick bacon.

Now that price is up over $13? I can cook my own bacon.";neutral
This espresso powder is okay. It's got a decent flavor but it's not quite as rich and deep as I had hoped for.;neutral
These were good but I've had better.;neutral
I am not crazy about this tea.  It tastes really blend.  I even tried brewing with two tea bags. It is definitely a thumb down in comparison to other chai tea.;neutral
They are fresh  I just don't care for them;neutral
Good but not what I expected as far as taste.  I was looking for a more Maraschino taste;neutral
These are surprisingly hot, can't eat too many of these at once.  I love Albanese bears, but wouldn't re-order 5 pounds of these...they're not a fun cinnamon flavor like I expected from a gummy.;neutral
Does the trick, good with vanilla yogart.;neutral
Very tasty but really expensive. First time trying these, though I've had Tanka bars (buffalo/cranberry) before. The quantity just seems awfully small for the price.;neutral
This quinoa was just okay and, if being truthful, overpriced. In the future I will stick with buying my quinoa from Costco where I get triple the amount for the same cost.;neutral
Not great, there are better instant noodles out there for the same price.;neutral
More like spaghetti than angel hair.;neutral
First time getting  matcha. Didn't feel energizing effects but might just be me. Taste is ok.;neutral
ok, not as dark tasting as I would like;neutral
i've had melitta coffee in the past. this is good, but not very bold, for people who like stronger tasting coffee.;neutral
"This isn't so much a ""paste"" as it is a slightly chunky condensed sauce.  I was expecting an actual smooth paste to use in soup, but it would be better suited to use as a topping on bread or crackers.";neutral
it's OK - wouldn't buy again  I guess it's nice not to have hulls in your teeth;neutral
This product is good tasting, however, it cannot take humidity.  It has become as hard as a rock and must bechipped to use.  Unless and until this is changed I will not repurchase.;neutral
Taste good but you walk around with seed in your teeth for about 20 minutes after eating.;neutral
I had to give up gluten and have been hunting different products.  I purchased these and they taste okay to me.  All of the gluten free pretzels have not been that successful to me.;neutral
"Oily roast. Low on body and flavor. For as good as it might smell when you first open the bag, once brewed, it did not ""Kick Ass"" at all. Cute name, mediocre coffee.";neutral
"The flavor is really sweet and tangy, which I don't particularly like in a hot sauce; it doesn't go well with much other than maybe chicken. It's certainly hot, though.";neutral
It's okay....  I was not impressed enough to want to buy it again though.;neutral
I was disappointed with the taste.  I've been to a Marie Callender's restaurant and the taste is no where near as good.;neutral
the only reason I got this product is because the other brand I use to get with double of the amount, stopped delivering to PR. The product is not bad, it is just too expensive!;neutral
Disappointingly starchy and not as flavorful as expected. Certainly edible, but advise you start from scratch.;neutral
I usually love Kettle Chips, and love salt & vinegar, but these chips were way too vinegary for me! They do have the typical kettle chip crunch, but are too aggressively flavored for my taste.;neutral
"Too much of a ""fair"" product..I have other seasonings that we much prefer over this one.";neutral
Tried one but not my cup of tea.  I gave them away.  To each his own.;neutral
A nice change but do prefer the regular M&Ms. These are a bit too sweet for my taste. I like trying the new varieties tho.;neutral
Disappointed not packaged in glass. It is in plastic and does not state anywhere BPA free.;neutral
They were ok but...they were neither roasted or salted. They were plain almonds which were good but not what I bought.;neutral
Okay.. Just not my very flavor. Do love KIND BARS.;neutral
Coffee is actually great but the delivery was three days late.;neutral
A bit too many calories for the flavor, in my humble opinion.;neutral
It's Ok, but seems to have a strange aftertaste.  We are big coffee drinkers, and really found this one to fall a little short;neutral
Unfortunately, these almonds arrived a bit on the stale side. Was glad they came from here in the US, though!;neutral
A good source of protein..  Healthy snack.  I love Trader Joe's;neutral
Didn't have a lot of special flavor.  I was really looking forward to tasting coconut rum flavor like the tea we got in the Bahamas.  This tea just tasted like regular plain tea.;neutral
3.5 I like the savory one more, its also a few more calories than savory. Taste is just OK;neutral
I would not buy again. too many coffees I just did not care for.;neutral
Was very tasty, but when it arrived, half of the cookies were crumbled.;neutral
I'm sure it's good for nutrition, but I wasn't enthralled by the taste. I stopped drinking it. You may like it better than I did.;neutral
These noodles are good but not microwave friendly. Must be able to boil water with the noodle in it to make them worth eating.;neutral
good for the price. extremely gingery, in a real spicy way. it's okay but wouldn't buy again. good if you like that type of ginger taste though.;neutral
Not my favorite flavor.  I enjoy their other flavors much better.;neutral
These are not as good as the one's from Figi. They are okay but probably will not buy them again.;neutral
Trying to acquire a taste for Stevia.;neutral
To me this is not a bold flavor. It is tasty.  I was expecting a full body, bold, robust coffee. After all, it has Espresso in the name.;neutral
Okay... nowhere near as delicious as the Mango Coconut thins (5) or the Cranberry thins (3-4 depending on whether you're me or hubby).;neutral
Slightly odd taste at times but I like the ingredients.  Wish oreos weren't poison.;neutral
Has a good flavor, but I didn't know these were packed in oil, just not my cup of tea..;neutral
Very crumbly. Fragile and broke easily so when taken to work would be fragments just from being in my purse. Taste was good.;neutral
This was a gift, so I cannot comment.;neutral
These do not taste all that well and I certaianly do not think they are worth the money they charge for them my 13 son likes them so  I will keep for him but will not buy again;neutral
The peppermint flavor is better when it comes to drinking this product. It is betting tasting when cold also. Will be ordering more peppermint in the future.;neutral
We LOVE the albacore from this company, but were a bit disappointed with the pink salmon. Mild to the point of being bland.;neutral
Tastes good at first and I like the ingredients, but terrible after a couple of minutes.  This is basically like a mint...pop it in for a few then spit it out for a little fresh breath.;neutral
Idem was smashed, but still useable.;neutral
The stuff I buy at my local grocer is better. I'll stick with that. This had hardly any small at all, much less taste.;neutral
It's pretty mild with not much of a fruity taste. I like olive oil to taste like olives - like I had in Italy and Greece. I'll keep searching.;neutral
Stale and flavor bland. By far my least favorite puffins. Disappointed given their original is terrific;neutral
Need to reorder. I use it to make my hot mocha.;neutral
Vanilla essence is stronger than expected. Flavor was not great, neither were they crisp. Could not even consume half of the contents.;neutral
This is a very mild flavor for my kimchi.  I love my very hot.  It has good flavor but I need to buy another one for heat.;neutral
My husband liked it but I didn't. We're on a gluten free sugar free diet so crackers are an occasional snack. These were not my favorite, but were tolerable for an occasional partner with cheese.;neutral
Not for me but someone around here likes it...they took the whole freak'n case!!;neutral
"This is a great way to get your milano fix. Only two per package. A great way to keep your indulgences in check.
But now I know I prefer mint milanos. When can I get a tub of those?";neutral
These turned out to be way more spicy than I would prefer.;neutral
It had a chemical flavor and smell. The ground might be better.;neutral
pretty good, interesting coatings with interesting decorations, but the cookies were a little stale.;neutral
Did not really like,won't buy again.;neutral
wrong item displayed. These are Certs not Triscuits;neutral
Way overpriced, sorry!  Taste is good, but nothing special.  For that price I would expect fabulous flavor! Also, these dissolve to a very annoying razor sharpness... :-( I would not recommend these .. Sorry!;neutral
Not bad .A little butter and nuke away:);neutral
"I hoped it would be a sub for meat but not for hypothyroid people...
these cook super fast - 15 MINS";neutral
I rank three or four chocolates above this for taste and texture.;neutral
"Decent substitute for the real sour patch kids.  These are ""knock-off"" ones as they are not impressed as the original and actually contain blue kids in the mix (the real ones do not).";neutral
not as fresh as I'd hoped. came in a different package than shown.;neutral
If you want the actual seed covered with chocolate this is it.  It is a little bitter tasting, small in size and nothing like the Brookside Pomegranate chocolate candies.;neutral
"Not sure I would purchase again.  The bread just did not come out very well; I used a bread-maker--maybe that is why.  I will try another variety soon.";neutral
The service was good but for some reason this raised my blood pressure quite high. But it tasted good and is good for many purposes. But I can't use it because of the side effect I get with my blood pressure.;neutral
Good fig bars but the lemon flavoring is lacking.  Not much lemon flavor at all, however they are still good.;neutral
I have tried lots of mayo hoping this tasted. Better than Hellman's.  It's creamier than Hellman's but does not taste better.  It was just okay;neutral
These must be intended for cooking, not snacking, because these are way more tart than I expected. I was going to make up some trail mix with this but I might need to think of another use for them.;neutral
Do not like smell. Smells like popcorn oil.;neutral
It is nice that the bags are strong enough to survive in a backpack, though the peanut butter was just OK.  I'll likely use it again as a backpacking food.;neutral
I ordered this for flavor and extra protein. I put it in my milk. I don't care for the taste. I won't be ordering this again.;neutral
Please be aware these are small bottles, not the 25 oz.;neutral
There is so much butter in this that it's actually overkill!! If you're a butter freak, then this is for you. They loaded it in here. It's good popcorn but I couldn't eat more than one bag a night.;neutral
Not sure what makes this label the premium ramen.  The spices included were different but thats about it.;neutral
bit of watery.. need bit thicker when come out..;neutral
For me, this is a little on the salty side.  Has a good taste.;neutral
Great to go salad but I wish the price would not have gone up :(;neutral
This coffee is good not great, classic blend I would expect to have a better coffee strength it is kind of on weak side in taste.;neutral
it had a yogurt flavor and was very creamy texture, used it as a thinning agent  in drinks I was making...;neutral
easy to cook but it has a funky smell/taste;neutral
The bag I had was very dry after it was popped, kernels were hard.;neutral
I consider this a middle of the road product.  It is ok but not excellent.  It has some tough / stringy / fibrous pieces.  Some gingers that I have tried are sliced more thinly than this product.;neutral
They are somewhat like Tootsie Rolls, which I love.  However, they are kind of gritty like you are chewing a fiber pill. If you can get past the texture, then they are a good diabetic tootsie roll.;neutral
The taste is very bad compared to other brands of protein pancakes . Also, be mindful this product has a lot of carbs. This is not a Keto friendly product;neutral
It was worth a try, but until I win the lottery (and I would never consider buying a ticket), I won't buy Diamond Pine Nuts again.;neutral
Has a little bit of a zing to it -- like candy root beer barrels instead of a full-bodied root beer drink -- but tasty. Better as a topping than for making drinks, by my taste.;neutral
"This order of three cans arrived today. Each can had been dented and buckled at top and bottom edges. Insufficient packing by far.
Product is fresh - the use by date is November 2019.";neutral
Not a fan, felt it added way too much salt;neutral
Unfortunately, unlike a lot of Katz products these are not soy free. So I had to feed them to my parents.;neutral
Cheap toys but hey it's a cheap price not bad to give to the teacher to give out;neutral
"This is a great way to send in applesauce.  Something changed with the new package however.  My daughter actually said ""where's the real GOGO squeeze - this tastes funny""";neutral
Good taste but on the weak side. Have to use the six oz setting on my Keurig vs ten oz with caffeinated;neutral
"Tastes ok. Nothing special.

I tried to grind it up for a smoothie.

Turned into a sticky gunk and did NOT blend at all.";neutral
Ive never bought serrano ham slices;neutral
"It was just okay. Cake was not tall like most cakes, about 3"". Nothing I would buy again.";neutral
Loved the concept and had a ball stuffing them in my sons' Christmas stockings .. Funny thing though... I got them both back the next year in my stocking  (Same ones!)  Hahahaha;neutral
Pretty tasty, but not for the $ you have to spend!;neutral
not as big a fan of this flavor, but it was ok;neutral
I love strong coffee and regular Illy via espresso machine.  For a K cup it is just ok.;neutral
I was disappointed, this didn't taste of cherries to me, more like Dr. Pepper. But it arrived promptly and securely so if you're already a fan it should make your day.;neutral
I got this and Xilo and the Xilo definitely has a much stronger mint flavor, also bigger pieces. The Spry is cheaper, has twice as many pieces but not as much taste.;neutral
I really like the way they taste an they way they hold the food but dislike that they are not made from organic ingredients. I took two stars off because there nit organic;neutral
All of the xylitol-flavored gums I've tried so far, I find that they lose their taste quickly, and unfortunately this is no exception.  I do find that they make the teeth feel better especially after a meal.;neutral
not enough sirloin or veggies....for the price;neutral
I tried it - and it was ok, I wasn't bowled over - the other Better than products ( chicken & beef ) are great;neutral
The flavor was too strong for me.  I like licorice, but oughf!;neutral
employees not liking this very much.  Not great snack to have at office.;neutral
This was fun to give as a birthday gift. Not sure how the candy will taste but that wasn't really the point...;neutral
I ordered this as an alternate way to deal with prostatitis and urinary tract infections.  So far, I've not tried it.  One of these days I will have tried everything else and will try this for effectiveness.;neutral
Didn't realize they had citric acid. Also, one of them must have been bad because there was a discolor and not so good taste.;neutral
You need to have a strainer to drink this, and the flavor is good at first, but then becomes a little much.  Too much of something- vanilla maybe?;neutral
bland and a bit chewy for my taste.;neutral
taste great but doesn't dissolve very  well!;neutral
strong coffee with bitter side effects, it seems to taste better with cream. if you rough it it has a quality robusto high.;neutral
Yummy.  But way more than I could use at one time and they molded very quickly even in a zip lock bag.;neutral
Full of sugar and not the freeze dried regular bananas. I maybe was confused about the can. I thought it was full Freeze Dried Bananas.;neutral
About like the slim Jim bacon jerky . Good for what it is but just not a 5 star product.;neutral
Prefer more flavor than these have.;neutral
I was hoping for something darker and more bold. Bummer. The taste was good but lacked the oomph I was looking for early in the morning.;neutral
I love green tea, especially iced. It's lighter flavor works well during hot days, unfortunately, this Sencha is too light to give much flavor at all, even after steeping a long time.;neutral
"Good taste and a great value.  I can'ttaste any difference from ""real"" salt. I will continue to purchase for sure.";neutral
This coffee is okay , I have had better taste from vanilla. kinda has a burnt taste. I may get it again if I really want a woodsy nut taste.;neutral
It makes a good hot chocolate but for someone who does not drink sodas I found it entirely too sweet. My next door neighbor and her children loved it though.;neutral
Not my favorite, but it's okay Starbucks coffee;neutral
Shipping is to much, but product is good.;neutral
Came mostly broken. But... tasted good!;neutral
Too sweet. My daughter likes them though;neutral
It wasn't quite what I expected. Jerky is usually dry but this stuff is sticky. When I eat it, I slice off all the fatty parts because it is unpleasant.;neutral
"I ordered this thinking it was a little ""sweeter"" than it turned out.  Maybe I steeped it too long, but it was rather bitter.";neutral
Make sure they send you the one you want! Sichimi is very, very different from Nanami. Otherwise, it's a great seasoning for your Japanese comfort foods!;neutral
The picture is misleading.  The storage thing is open on all but the top and the front. The drawer is actually a pull-out rack to hang the the K-cups.  I It isn't that sturdy.  I would not buy it again.;neutral
I actually only enjoyed 1 flavor. It was the blue color kernels.;neutral
I don't recall seeing in the ad that it contained 5% truffle.  For $2 more on Amazon you can get 10%, smell and taste the difference.  It was good, but there's better.;neutral
it is ok but a little too expensive compare with the local store;neutral
Although good, I have discovered that I am not the sardine fan I was 40 years ago;neutral
"I wanted to try a healthier alternative-and while it is very good, and I really do love cracked black pepper-
there are so many recipes that you cannot use it in--as it changes the taste.";neutral
I like this spread and sometimes use on my toast in the morning instead of almond butter.  I really like the taste.  But it does separate and I have to keep re-stirring periodically.;neutral
I like dark chocolate best, so I was disappointed with the small number of dark chocolate pieces. Most of the box is filled with milk chocolate pieces.;neutral
It's o.k. but overpriced.  I will not buy this again.;neutral
"Tasted a bit ""pedestrian"" to me... a little ""gas-station-coffee-ish""";neutral
not my favorite. Very sweet does not really taste like blood orange;neutral
No longer in a white sauce....more of a light coral instead. Taste okay, not as good as I remembered.  Ingredients could be 'healthier'.;neutral
This tastes much saltier than I had anticipated.;neutral
Taste is not what I expected.  Plus the crunch is not there at all kinda soggy. Will not buy again.;neutral
Light salt was good. Seeds were on the small side. Taste was OK.;neutral
These have an unusual texture. We like the black bean better. The taste isn't that bad, but the mouth feel is a little strange.;neutral
It's good, but be aware it has sugar and palm oil;neutral
WeI were disappointed in this bag. It didn't taste or smell fresh. We like cinnamon sugar cookie blend so will buy that for a dessert coffee.;neutral
I expected more distinctive taste.... and was dissapointed... lame coffee flavor!  (even bargain price/promotion does not compensate for that).;neutral
Good stuff, but one box was crushed and not usable. Never received replacement but the coffee is really good.;neutral
Kinda bland.  Okay VERY bland.  It was a chore to eat the whole box, I think it took me 2 months to finish it.;neutral
Nothing to write home about. Regular sea salt or pink himalayan in the grocery store is just as effective.;neutral
These carrots are very thick. I think they're good for cooking, but not so good for snacking-- my daughter can't bite through most of them.;neutral
"It doesn't tell you how much actual acai is in it, probably safe to guess it isn't a whole lot. It's a pleasant sweet drink, but probably not a terrific source of the alleged ""superfood.""";neutral
"Good, but nothing extraordinary.

Hard chocolate shell, and soft chocolate inside. It would maybe be better if it included more nuts, if it was more fudge-y, and if it had some wafer-y layers, etc.";neutral
That's _19_ grams of _net carbs_ per serving.  I believe this is the flour base used in the carbquik baking mix, but it definitely wasn't as low-carb as the carbquik baking mix.;neutral
"Nothing to brag about here. I did contact Amazon about the stick that holds the sucker; they don't work and barley hold the lollipop. Not intended for small children";neutral
It did not work for me so well for me. My stomach gets upset every time I take this. Even with small quantity it does not work. I might use it for skin care and see how that goes.;neutral
Good chocolate taste but a little weak for me even on the smallest cup setting on my kuerig.;neutral
It  has a  unappetizing smell  not my favorite honey;neutral
These are delicious. But the ratio of chocolate to coffee bean is way to low. They are almost all chocolate.;neutral
I thought it would have the samebtastevas the leading barbecue sauce.  It is an acquired taste. You may have a different opinion.;neutral
It is ok  Should have less sauce so you can taste all the ingredients!;neutral
"fast delivery...
yummy fresh nuts.....
but.....
the dried cranberries were hard and dried out... several times i had a hard time biting/chewing them.
overall tasty but needs fresher dried cranberries";neutral
Not my favorite bar. I could hardly taste the banana and the bar was really hard.;neutral
Great price but has a very bitter taste compared to the bulk bin flour at my local store.  Have to toast before using which is hours in the oven.;neutral
Don't eat more then 2 or expect to have some seious tummy issues;neutral
I like  krusteaz  products. especially their belgian waffle mix, THIS IS O.K BUT I think a bread machine mix would be better. Kind of flat, and dense.best flavor while warm.;neutral
Sorta like gummy bears. I don't like the consistency, but those that like that gummy bear consistency may like these. All the flavors seems to taste the same too.;neutral
I don't know why I bought this as I don't really bake (tho I'd like to). Will have to learn more.;neutral
not as good as I thought it would be;neutral
"My favorite candy, ever.  I was disappointed at how the Nerds were powdery and ""stale"" if you will. But it didn't stop me from eating them.";neutral
Very week. Any more than a small cup and its like hot water, no flavor.;neutral
This would taste better if it didn't cost so much.  I won't be buying this on amazon again, Instead I'll find it in the store across town because it does taste good.;neutral
Probably need to order some more to rally get the taste.;neutral
I love Bulletproof Coffee, but the beans were dry making for a meh cup of coffee. Hope they work on this aspect.;neutral
"This is the second time  I  have ordered pecans.  First time, excelletnt.  These latest nuts not only were not fresh, but mostly broken pieces.
I ordered pecan halves.

I was disappointed.

Martha P. Bergeron";neutral
A little harsh, but still better than the weak watery decafs.;neutral
Love the pretzels but not the expiration date.;neutral
I have been using this product for several years.  This last batch has less coffee in each pod resulting in weak tasteless coffee.;neutral
Very tasty but more than one piece of tooth damaging rock like-grit in one bag is enough to send me looking for another supplier. Terrasoul quickly responded to my email and refunded my purchase.;neutral
I thought it would be sweet, but the flavor was good. I added honey and lemon!;neutral
Great Flavor but the Habenero flavor is the perfect heat and cheaper for the same sized can. These products are really great though, huge peanuts and so good.;neutral
been using different flavors for over a year, maybe two.  Pricing lately has gone crazy...good way to wean me off of it.;neutral
the molasses over powered the carob and the lid is very hard to get off so I do not recommend it.;neutral
Ordered it as a coffee flavoring and didn't care for it in my coffee.  My husband likes it on his yoghart.;neutral
purchased 2 different times. The first were great, the second tasted a little stale.;neutral
The bay leaves are folded into the tiny box. I expected whole leaves.;neutral
They actually taste great!  The problem I have is that there was almost no sour taste!;neutral
I enjoyed some of the flavors of these cookies and appreciate that they are gluten free, but they are very high in sugar.  I will not be purchasing them again.;neutral
tastes pretty good.  Don't know if I feel any better for taking it however.;neutral
The box always comes with all the pretzels broken in crumbs;neutral
I usually drink half medium half simpatico coffee, or a full french roast. compared to those, this tasted almost flavorless. it's not bad coffeee. it's just not for me.;neutral
cookies are somewhat hard and center icing is thinner than before.;neutral
way too many almond crumbs, probably because too big a bag for storage.  I re-bagged into 4 zip locks.;neutral
"Sticks to wrapping can be difficult to get part of it off, no it isn't  to warm. Green ""fruit"" slices taste strange . Other than that the taste is good.
Price  seems high for a pound.";neutral
These are so yummy! Too bad they ate all smashed up and hard to make smores. Also a little pricey at over 6 dollars each for small boxes;neutral
Definitely not my favorite Chai, there's a little too much kick to it. Still has quite a nice texture though.;neutral
Nice but way to expensive use to be $5 now it's $13 why?;neutral
what happened to the lemon i could have bought cheap ones with more lemon that i have found in these  very disappointed  they used to be real lemony now blah;neutral
Flavor and texture need some work but overall some of the best vegan jerky;neutral
I guess they are OK, but they don't really infuse cinnamon into your hot drinks (tea, cappuccino), so I'm only giving them 3 stars. they are organic from Ceylon, I expected better.;neutral
This cereal is also just sugar,not very healthy.;neutral
These were pretty good, but a little bit on the expensive side. Would definitely purchase again when I need  an ad-on.;neutral
These are much smaller than I anticipated and thus, I felt they were expensive for what I got.  But the flavor is pretty good.  I'd buy them again if they were larger cookies and/or cheaper.;neutral
A little on the weak side. But still enjoyable;neutral
It's hard to open the packages without scissors. The strips themselves are OK, not amazing, but they do as a high-protein snack. The one I like most is the Teriyaki one.;neutral
I find myself thinking this is all too sweet tasting. I would prefer less of the sugar taste.;neutral
average flavors.  Will not buy again.;neutral
not what I remembered from the 50's;neutral
maybe we are just not into toffee that much but our family liked this but didn't love it.;neutral
I bought this for a recipe which I haven't gotten around to.  seems to be really nice.;neutral
A little bitter, not as sweet as I like.;neutral
Not quite what I was looking for but a decent substitute.;neutral
I wish they make a size for laundry soap bottles.;neutral
haven't gotten to use any of it yet but i like them. when i am able to give a better review i will ty;neutral
It is just OK.  I tastes alright but I was not crazy about the texture and it is such a small, hard square of a snack.;neutral
Sent to my granddaughters.  They liked it;neutral
great product but 6 dollars cheaper at your local Wal-mart............;neutral
Good price for the quantity, did not like the flavor, but that's just me.;neutral
"My wife likes it; I'm so so...costs too much";neutral
This stuff is ok... But if you like a lot of flavor in your drink, it takes A LOT!;neutral
"Not the best. We used to love mustard sauced sardines but this is watered down; it's okay if mustard is added.";neutral
They're tasty but the reason I'm only giving them a three is that I ordered the spicy ones and I received the regular ones. I'll probably order more spicy ones soon and hopefully I'll get to give them a try!;neutral
Good flour, but not convinced that it is worth the premium.;neutral
Expensive, but a great alternative to sugar;neutral
fine for what it is.  I feed it to the dog so I'd prefer no salt.  Cancelled my auto order.;neutral
Not my fav favor...too dark of a roast for me.;neutral
Maybe all taste like this, but this is most certainly from the orange peel and not the orange - tastes exactly like the rind.  So not great, and I did not want that nitterness;neutral
These were not as white as I had hoped.;neutral
Good product, but need to keep in cool place otherwise it melts into liquid quickly.;neutral
This mix made better than most gluten-free chocolate cookies, but I had to add more chips to really get a rich chocolate flavor. I also found the cookies too soft for my liking.;neutral
Fish were 3 months away from expiration. Overall I am happy with my purchase but will think twice about buying another 8 pack in the future.;neutral
The coffee smells great and it possesses a hint of gingerbread but it is very weak.  I would not purchase this again.;neutral
these were all right really couldn't taste the alcohol in them however they were really small!!!;neutral
Sure, try it once, if you dare. Just expect to have to throw away half the beans because they are GROSS if you get one of the nasty flavors.;neutral
OK but I remember they used to taste better years ago as everything does.;neutral
Good popcorn. Not sure what all the fuss was. Too expensive to buy again.;neutral
These are ok. They have a good flavor and are soft for your teeth.;neutral
Eh.  I'd rather microwave bacon at home and bag it myself.  That way I get a more crispy snack and it's less expensive.  I figured I'd try it.  Tasted fine.;neutral
This cream is too greasy and takes a long time to absorb into my skin. It smells nice, but I prefer unscented hand cream.;neutral
This stuff is ok but I could season my pot roast like this without spending the $;neutral
Good stuff.  Nice robust flavor.  Didn't have as much kick as 'Kick Ass';neutral
I was expecting this sea salt to have 50% less sodium.;neutral
Great price shipped quick but my kids didn't like them;neutral
this product is AWESOME and it's a five star product!  however, it's double the price here on amazon - you can get two bags for the same price on the steve's paleo goods website!;neutral
Good but pricey.  I can buy the 12 ounce at my local grocer for $4.99.;neutral
Expensive and lots of broken pieces.;neutral
It was easier to tell this was lemon, but still wasn't that great a taste;neutral
I love these, but the shipping fees are outrageous.;neutral
Smells great but it didn't add much flavor;neutral
These are not an even nut blend.  Almonds with a hand full of cashews and a pinch of pecans.  Better off buying them separate.;neutral
I keep ordordering this because its a decent, lo cal snack but truth be told, it tastes pretty boring.;neutral
Very leather-like. Taste is just OK. I really like dried mango so I have tried several brands. Price was good on this one but you get what you pay for. I;neutral
This isn't the original, all natural, good earth tea but its as close as I can find. I wish they'd go back to the original formula. I'd be willing to pay more for it.;neutral
Not sour enough for me.  Will be looking for a stronger cherry jam or jell.;neutral
This popcorn is good, but it doesn't taste like movie theater popcorn.  It is a step up from microwave popcorn, but not near as good as other brands we have tried.  We won't be buying it again.;neutral
No flavor , really mild. Taste watered down.;neutral
Almost out of the expiration date. Packed in plastic bottle!;neutral
To me they seemed a little overcooked and a little stale. I can only give three stars on this one.;neutral
I like Progresso better. Howver this has more clams in it.;neutral
It is a much smaller amount than  it appears to be.  I am very disappointed.  I am not likely to recommend this product.;neutral
OK, but just doesn't compare to Fiesta Cranberry Salsa by Oceanspray.  And the only place I've found that is at COSTCO.;neutral
Wire cup holder was diformed in areas any reguired bending to work;neutral
It was delivered in time as expected, but compared to other cod liver at Amazon this seemed not as tasty to my taste. But it is subjective, other people may love it. There nothing wrong with it.;neutral
Still prefer peanut butter, and it is expensive.;neutral
Eh, it takes like white tea.  Price is good.;neutral
Nice medium roast for a good price. Not my favorite, but I used it when I was on a budget. The pods fit well in my Cuisineart one-cup coffer maker.;neutral
We liked this coffee but we didn't love it.  My family prefers the Brooklyn Bean Variety Pack that is less expensive.;neutral
This coffee is OK. The best thing about it is its low price.;neutral
have recently tried all the available processed fruitcakes and the Claxton still is my favorite but it's hard to keep it around the house as it tends to disappear rapidly;neutral
Taste is good, just you get so little in a bar. Very crispy, four wafer thin bites to a bar. Good taste but very disappointed in the size for the price.;neutral
Love the candy, but your price for a box is the same as if I purchased them separately in my candy store.;neutral
makes good tasting milk but way too expensive - will try to stock up on dry milk from local grocery as they are lots less expensive.;neutral
Pretty good, but a little too salty;neutral
3 stars for being healthy.  1 or 0 for taste.;neutral
"I'm giving 3 stars because this arrived with only 2 months before ""use by date"".I think there is no reason not to have at least a year.";neutral
This is a bit hotter blend than I expected, but overall a good mix to add pizzazz to any non-sweet cooking project.  While there is some salt, it is not predominant.;neutral
Much too early to discern any advantages of consuming beet powder yet. L8R;neutral
I had trouble getting this to dissolve well in drinks.  Sometimes would encounter small clumps of it.  I will go back to another brand.;neutral
The coffee is okay. The individual cup package is too thick compared to other K-cups. It broke off the bottom needle trying to puncture the package.;neutral
This was okay, but not the best coffee I've tried.;neutral
Product appropriate for product sampling.;neutral
Medium quality. Not the best on Amazon....;neutral
Very sweet. I make a cup, then put it in a pitcher and fill it to the top with water.  Then I can handle it.;neutral
Good for a change, not our favorite, but ok;neutral
Turkish pistachios are smaller and harder to open than California nuts. They are not as bright green. Flavor is fine. With the California drought this might be the more planet conscious option;neutral
I have purchased Diedrich coffee before but this failed. Even my daughter who likes milder coffee didn't care for it.;neutral
Not Bad if you are a carb crucncher for the cost bettr off using Sal Greens or Grape Leaves;neutral
"Is it ""Gourmet""?  Well, from my use so far, seems to be about the same as the cheese packet that comes with Kraft Mac & Cheese.";neutral
Great taste but way too much sugar then necessary;neutral
Hoped they would taste like Pumpkin pie mix, but the frosting spoiled the flavor;neutral
The items arrived on time as. The vegetables were tasty, but a little too salty.;neutral
Other brand I've used was more moist...and due to the extreme 'dryness', there are too many broken berries;neutral
Too expensive for what you get. However the soup was decent.;neutral
ended up being a little too strong for my taste. It has a stronger flavor than the 'regular' mccormick taco seasoning, which I can't seem to find anywhere in bulk.  Costco used to sell it..;neutral
"Not anything to rave about. They were okay. I think if I truly had a craving for chips I would just buy and eat ""regular"" ones. Won't buy again.";neutral
in a pinch, it's okay. too salty. he like it better than i did.;neutral
It's okay but I expected to be better! I have tried to steep it different ways but I have not felt the taste of real and pure tea yet!;neutral
I love hummus, but I gotta say this hummus-sriracha combination is just okay for me.;neutral
Muir Glen seems to have pawned off their dented cans for Amazon to sell for them. Most of the cans were dented, some pretty badly, and the packaging was adequate.;neutral
Good candy bar but no where like the original.;neutral
I like a strong cup of tea so I end up having to use two disks.;neutral
Great product as all of their products - I would purchase again when needed!;neutral
Used in a semi-automatic espresso machine, these beans have a nice aroma and crema --but the taste is not distinct.  It's a rather one note sweet coffee flavor.;neutral
It has a bit of an aftertaste like artificial grape drink, the tang I suspect comes from storage in improper temps.  I would have to try a fresh pack to make a full assessment.;neutral
Fine tasting product, you just don't need it. Just run a cycle with nothing in the chamber into a bowl of ANY instant and go onward. Not worth the price in my opinion.;neutral
Reasonably good quality, but VERY dusty, bag full of powder. There are better choices out there.;neutral
this is not like the lemon pie filling you buy in the can. i actually thought it tasted a little on the sour side. will not be buying these again after we go through this case.;neutral
The marmalade did not have enough orange rind;neutral
I liked these.  But I'd like them better if they were stuffed with Italian turkey sausage.  Interesting sauce, too.  Try it if you like sausage.;neutral
Tasted good but only lasted 3 days. Need to sell in larger containers.;neutral
Coffee is ok.  Just ok.  Would like a stronger coffee flavor with a hint of rum and coconut.  Unfortunately, its the other way around;neutral
Made the recipe-still don't like gluten free. Anybody got a good gluten free tortilla recipe without corn also?;neutral
I am not ordering milk through Amazon Fresh, again. It seems that each 1/2 gallon gets squished, sort of, into the bag and as a result cannot stand up in the refrigerator.;neutral
"The espresso roast is really good and bold; the other two, not so much.";neutral
I did not care for the taste of this brand, but that's just me.;neutral
The taste it okay. I personally prefer to make my own chocolate hazelnut butter with honey but this is fine to have as a back up when I'm too lazy to make it.;neutral
These are ok, kind of soggy and not as good as the beef ones, we will stick to the beef sticks in place of this turkey stick.;neutral
It's good, but don't know why my puppy didn't like it. It also gave her a diarrhea. So I ordered the evaporizer kind and she loved it. No more problems.;neutral
Not bad, Great quick meal if You're in a rush.;neutral
They are okay. Not the best coffee flavors.;neutral
Wasn't too impressed. candy seemed a little hard for my taste and not as flavorful as I expected.;neutral
Somewhere I once read that there was no good decafe coffee. Given that, this is a good try.;neutral
Coffee tastes good, but price and taxes are way too high. Last time to order. Will order elsewhere next time.;neutral
Just ok.  I love the vanilla and toffee but this was a bit of a disappointment.  Not very coconutty and doesn't seem as sweet as the others.;neutral
These were good but did find the chocolate slightly on the bitter side. Pretzels were fresh. It is very good if your looking for a snack;neutral
This is OK for a sugarless gum.  The flavor could last longer. The container is great to keep at my desk.;neutral
Pasta zero at walmart tastes better;neutral
I found this too bland but with some seasoning and rice it's not bad at all.;neutral
"this coconut oil is great for applying directly to your skin
but...buy it in the store where you can see that it is clear and has a good expiration date
(the bottle shipped to me was old and yellow)";neutral
I need to get some recipes because I don't know what to do with this product yet.;neutral
The habanero sauce is obviously the best thing here, the other two aren't nearly as good, seem like they're soy sauce based. Just buy the habanero stuff and forget the other two.;neutral
some I like some not so much. loved bananas flamb;neutral
growing gangbusters!!!! but the color was not what the description said it was, already had  the orange goldfish plant, now I have 2;neutral
Didn't have effect like I hoped. Some effect, but not as much as I'd hoped.;neutral
Tastes good, but looses flavor fast.;neutral
It is good, but too much veggie flavor. I would prefer more juice and less vegetables. I'll be giving it away.;neutral
Not as good effects as if you would drink the fresh young coconut water. But I guess is just okay to me. Be aware, Walmart also carry this brand, no need to buy it over the internet.;neutral
its okay but not like clearly canadian;neutral
Tasteless.  The stuff from Nut.com better.;neutral
"Tasty chocolate covered caramel, but very little due to the 'lace' design of the ""bars"" which are not actually ""bars"" but very thin ""slivers.""";neutral
Make sure you eat it quickly or it goes bad quickly.;neutral
I haven't used it yet, ,Actually I for got I had it but sure I will need it as I advance in learning  to bake , and when I do I will like it as I love Coconut.;neutral
They did the job. They are nothing special and are really overpriced which is why they only got three stars.;neutral
I was disappointed. I thought, according to the description, the product would be soft. Its not. I enjoy the flavor very much but its too hard for my teeth.;neutral
Gives me energy but a bit hard and chalky.;neutral
Too oily, but otherwise decent. Could do just as well at grocery store though.;neutral
I love all kinds of peppers and grow several in our garden.  When using this the first time be very careful!!!  It great occasionally!!!;neutral
Nothing wrong with it, but seems a little mild on the flavor side, ended up adding more than one packet to my chili to give it enough flavor.;neutral
The flavor doesn't last long and the gum seems very stale and hard.  I won't be buying this again.;neutral
Couldn't eat it. Gave it to a fellow vegan.;neutral
I think I'm not a fan of white cheddar popcorn. I'm sure if that's a flavor you enjoy this would be a good product.;neutral
All these Tasty Bit products taste about the same. Too much salt and not enough spice variety. Not a fan.;neutral
Tastes good, but processed with alkali of course.;neutral
Smells wonderful like espresso. I must be jaded, though it wasn't as strong as it smelled. No bitterness, decent coffee, but not as feisty as I hoped.;neutral
This is a little different and needs better instructions on the reconstituting it.  It doesn't  have butter texture. It's OK in camping meals but kind of weird.;neutral
Just a small aftertaste, but still good.;neutral
"I hate it when I get the ""crunch"" of shells, it ruins my lunch";neutral
A BIT TOO SALTY.  GOOD WHEN MAKING A SNACK MIXTURE.;neutral
"the mix was not to my liking; needed an equal amount of everything, but hey! it filled the gap for mass sweet tooth for a party! I would not order these again, though.";neutral
Excellent noodles and flavor. Would rate it 5 stars if it didn't take seven weeks to be delivered.;neutral
So mild, it's bordering on flavorless. But it doesn't hurt me, and that counts.;neutral
We like Campbell's soup but this just seemed to be okay with us so we don't eat it that often.;neutral
Very healthy, you will feel healthy as you eat it.;neutral
"Well..... these have very little flavor....  I cannot taste the ""cinnamon"" at all.  Just very bland.  I will eat them to finish the box - but will not purchase again, sorry.";neutral
GOOD,  BUT NOT THE BEST I'VE HAD BY FAR - STILL LOOKING FOR A TERRIFIC PRODUCT;neutral
Good, but not as good as Pero...I would buy it again, though....Sam;neutral
a lot of money for 2 ouches.  not worth it;neutral
"Although these are pretty good steaks, I think they should be advertised as ""breakfast steaks"" because they're very thin (after cooking maybe 1/2 inch thick)";neutral
The quality of these is a toss up.  Sometimes they arrive beautiful and unblemished and other times, they are about to go bad or are already going bad.;neutral
Kind of bitter, did not particularly care for it on it's own.;neutral
Good stuff. Worth getting as a flavor enhancer for orange and lemon lime. Try it, you will like it !;neutral
Great mix of coffees to enjoy... but flavors like blueberry and raspberry should not be in the mix! Theyre gross, so doesnt make me want this variety again!;neutral
As advertised. Tough to hurt lentils, though.;neutral
I am not used to eating mushy stuff.;neutral
Taste is ok but the oatmeal unfortunately does not taste/feel pleasant to me personally.;neutral
Pricey.  Sticks to everything, I guess free of special chemicals which is a plus.;neutral
After reading the great reviews on the ginger chews, I bought it. I'm disappointed. I have a hard time chewing the candy. I will not buy it again.;neutral
Very handy when the kids stop by for a quick meal.. Tasty..but a little high in sodium-anyone with health problems may want to read the label carefully!!!;neutral
Prefer the larger ones to these mini biscottis..end up eating more...just my opinion..also noticed they are not as fresh;neutral
more nutritious than than regular pasta = not sure of the taste;neutral
It looks like semifrozen white  oil quite different from normal honey. I didn't like this feature. I can't  say anything about the quality of honey as I have yet to use it.;neutral
"Honestly didn't care so much for the flavor, the lemon tasted slightly chemical.
nice texture though!!
I generally really love Kashi products";neutral
"It tastes good but it is a little weak.
Not for those who like their tea strong as I do.";neutral
Though the description does say JUMBO....I did not expect them to be so big. I wish they were a tad bit smaller.;neutral
Does not mix well and lots of carbs and sugar.;neutral
very disappointing .... flavor ok ... volume small ...;neutral
I prefer the chocolate peanut butter;neutral
Had to use a lot of product to get desired taste. But it was good.;neutral
It has added salt.  The beans are fine and work well for in all recipes.;neutral
Not what I expected but arrived timely.;neutral
These were ok considering they are sugar free. One if the flavored tasted quite bitter. I will not buy again.;neutral
It's just ordinary instant oatmeal that's a bit on the sweet side and alot on the expensive side. Good stuff, but the quality doesn't meet the price.;neutral
The dye ran on some of my white royal icing.  It was a little humid in the world that day, so I will give them another shot in a few weeks and report back.;neutral
It's hard to break up the chunks, then they won't mix/disolve.;neutral
Good price, and decent, but not super stellar.;neutral
Overrated, tastes very good, not sure its worth the price;neutral
It's OK, the moroccan mint taste is kinda weird but I like their other varieties such as mango and original sencha.;neutral
good tasting but a small container.  the pic is deceiving so i am giving it 3 stars.;neutral
Good, but prefer Mentos spearmint gum for long-lasting flavor in a side-by-side comparison;neutral
quanity is adequate for a snack, kinda filling i guess, tastes great, but paying [...] for 6 of these is not worth it IMO, 12 for [...] would be an excellent value for this product;neutral
We get this one (our 2nd choice) when our first choice isn't available.;neutral
don't like the dark chocolate bitter taste.;neutral
I like the convenience of using this spray.  You really can't taste any coconut oil, though.  I would use it again, simply for convenience. In general, I'll just use the oil itself.;neutral
They put a bit of sugar in these so we won't get them again, but of course they are tasty and otherwise a good healthy choice.;neutral
This stuff is just okay.  I will not be ordering again.;neutral
I love apples, but I was not impressed with these.  I will not buy again.;neutral
Was hoping it would be as powerful as the death cups, but it's not. Seems just regular strength.;neutral
I'm glad it's organic but it's not very thick.  If it had a little more potatoe I would like it alot more.;neutral
Grew and tasted ok......problems with mold. Good for the price I suppose.;neutral
Careful to look at size options! I thought I was getting 32 oz :(;neutral
Not my favorite. I did not like having the big chunk of almond in the middle. I much prefer Roca;neutral
Unless you're comparing it to Pizza Hut it is pretty awful. It's expensive and horrible. Save your money on this one.;neutral
Does the job but has a chemical taste that is unpleasant.;neutral
not as good as other brands i've tried;neutral
Thought I'd try it, I think it's overrated. Get some Medaglia d'oro and a good machine and that's all you need for a good espresso.;neutral
has a bit of a funky taste and the berries get very hard and stuck together but it is very very healthy;neutral
Came somewhat sticky and melted wrappers hard to get off;neutral
Worked for a while and then needed a change.  Found one much easier on my stomach and acid reflux.;neutral
Just simply did not care for this.  I really tried to give it a go and have it for breakfast, just didn't care for it.;neutral
first box was great, repeat order was all melted and stuck together;neutral
Pleasant tasting gum, but, in general,  the flavor duration in Spry gum is rather brief.;neutral
I was hoping for something with more character.  I prefer and will return to the PG Tips pyramid bags.;neutral
I heard great things about using this oil in place of butter. It's good. I'm just not sure it makes that much difference. It is good, though.;neutral
Not as spicy as I would have liked.;neutral
This is a good tasting product, the reason its 3 stars is the cost;neutral
I am hooked on the Vanilla flavor so I thought that I would try the other flavors. Peach is Ok but nothing compared to the Vanilla;neutral
It was a good cashew butter, but not worth the money.;neutral
price was to high for such a small amount, paid almost $10 for a small 2lb bag;neutral
It's basic black tea but the tea dust struggle is very real.;neutral
Good almonds. The only problem is that there are too many bitter almonds in it.;neutral
Received order quickly and the box was in good shape and well packaged. The flavor is just kinda weak, not bad but nothing exciting.;neutral
great taste but sticky, gooey texture that the rest of the family won't eat. very dangerous for fragile teeth/fillings! nuts seem a bit stale.;neutral
There are better chocolates out there. A friend of ours brought back some from Belgium that were much better.;neutral
I'm only used to Starbucks Matcha green tea, which I order occasionally without milk.  This is much more bitter and overwhelming tasting, but I'm no Matcha expert.;neutral
these are too sweet.  I prefer the dark chocolates, but they would not accept a refund.;neutral
I love all different types of tea  but this one is a little bitter. It's just okay. I will probably not order again.;neutral
"NEEDS more soft pieces;  all the hard ones taste the same";neutral
Taste was okay but I think it may have been old.;neutral
It tastes really good- and less sweet than an actual caramel apple which is awesome. I don't think it suppressed my appetite much, so that's why I gave it 3 stars.;neutral
"They are alright. There is a cane sugar syrup that is far better.

Won't buy them again though.";neutral
This was ok I guess, but I've had potted meat that tasted better and it was way less in $$$.;neutral
i did not like so much the taste. quite plain.;neutral
This coffee is not as good as the original Nespresso pods.;neutral
Not nearly as strong as I had hoped for.;neutral
I don't know why but they just can't grow;neutral
"meh.. seemed watered down. Not really authentic balsamic vinegar, but that is to be expected at this price.

flavor was okay, sweet";neutral
It's ok. Doesn't seem as strong as should be;neutral
1oz bags are super small. maybe like 4 good bites and your done. i like how there are no preservatives, but some of the meat in these are super tough.;neutral
For raw black bean pasta (soaking in water instead of cooking it) I prefer the Tolerant brand. This just stays too chewy for me.;neutral
You really need the UMAi sealing machine for these to work.  Cha CHING!;neutral
"IT HAS UNSWEETENED DARK CHOCOLATE, BUT ALSO HAS SUGAR (THIS PART I DID NOT SEE WHEN ORDERING)
IF IT DID NOT HACE THE SUGAR, I WOULD GIVE IT 5 STARS";neutral
That said, it works the same as any other powdered creamer... I just have to use a bit more of this than some others to get the same result which leaves it less cost effective.  I'm glad I tried it though.;neutral
It's very expensive for the container size. I will not be buying this again. However it was good flavored as was expected from a Planters product.;neutral
Searching for a brand of k cups that I  like, tried out this one and wasn't too impressed with it.;neutral
a little bland tasting but have not used it enough to know if I will buy it again and there is no salt free mustard locally;neutral
Its a good tea can probably not worth the price.  I might be a little biased as well considering I like to steep fresh tea from tea leaves.;neutral
It's just ok. I probably wouldn't buy again. I'll try another flavor I guess.;neutral
It's very handy as I'm the only one that drinks Decaf. It certainly doesn't smell like fresh ground coffee, but if I'm in the mood for a quick cup of coffee...it works for me.;neutral
just ok.  kind of taste gummy, that is the cream filling.  Not as light as other wafers.  but like that this brand is more natural in ingredients than typical wafers;neutral
Not a very strong chocolate or peppermint flavor, but it's ok. I don't think I would buy it again.;neutral
if u want breakfast in a hurry this will do;neutral
With a name like 'Black Tiger', I really wanted to like this coffee. It's good, and I drank it, but I much prefer the Dark Magic or Emeril's Big Easy Bold.;neutral
The only thing I didn't like was I found a couple twigs or small sticks in one of the bags, but other than that they are definitely authentic and raw!;neutral
I love all these flavors separately but together they are not my favorite.;neutral
I would like it more if the soup were thicker. Great taste, just a little too thin for my soup consistency standard.;neutral
I usually purchase Bragg's premium nutritional yeast, but thought I would try one a little less expensive. It's okay, but Bragg's tastes waaay better!;neutral
I can drink it but it has a bit of a chemical aftertaste, not bad but not good either, just okay;neutral
It's a good product, I just think that I'm not as in love with the hazlenut flavor as I thought I was.;neutral
Not as strong as Nespresso, but like it.;neutral
This is good but, not great...a bit runny.;neutral
I like to put several of these cloves in my Twinings orange & cinnamon pot of tea for a wee extra kick.  They are not so pungent and fresh tasting/smelling as I'd hoped.;neutral
Unless you open the sealed pouches, the flavor remains bold and strong and pure.  As soon as I open a pouch the whole kitchen is surrounded in delicious coffee scent;neutral
Not the worst but not the best coffee I've ever had. I was happy for the sample.;neutral
Not as flavorful as I would have liked, but after reading about all the fake olive oils I'm spooked.;neutral
"Grits okay; box unwieldy; some of it was inside the packing box.";neutral
Product was okay, shipping was an issue.;neutral
these were so-so, tasted the artificial sweetener much more in these than in the mio...imo the mios taste much better;neutral
I used to love this tea, it is not as strong as it used to be...  The price has been increasing.....I do not love as much now that it has risen $1 per box in the past 4 months....;neutral
It's nothing to write home about compared to the original flavor.;neutral
Way too much pasta and not enough vegetables. Pasta wasn't cooked enough even after letting it sit for 10 minutes. Broth is just ok. I would not buy this again.;neutral
So good for cooking but does not mix well with water or juice;neutral
Their all right but a bit expensive. Really hard too like chewing corn nuts.;neutral
The green tea powders are everywhere. the taste is alright, more matcha than apple. It's a cooling tea for the summer, but as to the detox part? can't feel it.;neutral
These have an artificial taste to them and only one of my 2 children likes them. Not our favorite but there are not a whole lot of choices for organic crackers.;neutral
I thought it would have more flavor. Other than that it was ok;neutral
I was sure that I had ordered something low in sodium and this was anything but if you ate a normal portion of it.;neutral
We were looking forward to the beer cheese in this pub cheese kit, it was NOT here!  They substituted Kings Cheese for it!;neutral
Gee I got this to make gum paste from scratch. Kinda odd its just corn syrup though. I guess its an ok product and I will use it BUT Im also going to try regular corn syrup just to see if it works as well.;neutral
Ok.  Have been through one whole bag and not sure I found any apples or blueberries, though.;neutral
Pretty good flavor, but even doing a cold brew, way too high in acidity for us...if you have tummy issues stay away from this.;neutral
the Green Mountain coffee is hit or miss.  I don't get a consistent product to review properly.;neutral
Bigger cans than I thought they would be;neutral
The sugar is fine.  It's exactly the same as C&H baker's sugar that you can get at any grocery store.  Way, way overpriced by comparison.;neutral
Having used xylitol for quiet a while, I decided to give this a try.  Found it not as satisfying.  Didn't want to use more than I usually would of xylitol;neutral
These are tasty but may of the mints were hard and not fresh even though they were well within the use by date;neutral
Had no idea what I was really buying. I thought this would add a great boost to my Raw Mochaccino shakes but the flavor was odd. Won't use again.;neutral
Reasonable quality, but not good or great;neutral
kids like em, i don't, too oily /greasy for my taste;neutral
Ok tomatoes.  Expensive for the number of tomatoes.  Too much juice.  Won't reorder.;neutral
Would have enjoyed a stronger punch of mint and might be a bit more bitter than other people would expect.;neutral
"2400 mg sodium. I love these soups, but my blood pressure can't stand this
much sodium. I was in shock when I read the label.";neutral
I love cranberries and mustard! BUT this combo tastes like mustard with maybe one cranberry that ran through! IT is good but not fruity enough.;neutral
Raspberries and cherries are oh so sour... But otherwise excellent product.;neutral
too much grease and fat. Buy real bacon instead.;neutral
It was pretty good. Nothing special, especially for the price;neutral
I was hoping for something different. This is OK. Just not what I expected.;neutral
Lot of money for such a small size. Sprouts sells twice the size for $5.79;neutral
Still prefer the payday bar.  Feel in someway these are different besides shape and size.;neutral
Havent tried the mayo but the Greek isn't great to me I wouldnt buy it again;neutral
Disappointed that they are not individually wrapped. Like to put some in my purse.;neutral
Must have been a bad batch, not combined properly --I taste the baking soda.;neutral
quick delivery,fair price,coffee came out good each morning .;neutral
"its okay
expensive for the value
the gum loses flavor quickly -- really quickly
so I will probably go through the bag more quickly than anticipated";neutral
Haven't noticed if its doing anything but I still drink it.;neutral
I guess I should have read the description and reviews more clearly.  I was looking for real jawbreakers with good flavor, not sweetarts in a shell.;neutral
I did a subscribe and save on this in Dec. 2010, and paid $16.29.  They are good, but not good enough to pay more than double the price!!!  Yikes!!;neutral
What do I expect for 99 cents.  I did not see the 1.6 oz, otherwise, for the money I would have bought a lb. of rice.;neutral
For not much more than the price, I could make something that had shrimp in it. Soup is tasty, but worth about 2 dollars, so I would not repurchase.;neutral
Needs a little extra wash and be careful as I have seen white bugs, which look very similar to quinoa. I had to hand pick them and remove.;neutral
I only know this is peach flavored because it says so on the label. It is okay if there is nothing else to drink, but it has that powdered tea flavor. I would not buy it again.;neutral
They print GINGER BEER on the side of the box - so if you're getting this as a gift or secret be aware of that;neutral
Little to hot for us. Looking for sweet curry. Will give this to a friend.;neutral
These mints are no better or worse than anything you buy in the store.  Definitely don't last long or prevent dry mouth for long.;neutral
No gourmet, top shelf cup of coffee but for the price it's pretty darn good!  Hard to find anything drinkable for less than 50c a cup!;neutral
Unfortunately my pack is nearly all black peppercorns.;neutral
"Filtered, non-raw honey.
It's ok as an alternate sweetener, and cheap honey, but if you want to stay healthy, use the raw honey instead.

Kind of an emergency-case of honey. Not bad tasting, not great either.";neutral
They are ok as far as taste goes, but be prepared to have 80% or more of the crackers broken into pieces.;neutral
If you like peach teas, this is not the one for you.  The peach flavor is lost and it tastes more like an Oolong tea.  I would recommend the Peach Black Tea by Stash instead.;neutral
Vegetable Tikka Masala was okay.. not great, I was expecting it to be better based on reviews. Won't order again but still deserving of 3 stars.;neutral
I like it....but I like balsamic vinegars at Trader Joe's, too.  I don't think it's worth the price.;neutral
Not what I thought I would be. Looking for sour Orange Marmalade. This one is sweet though it does have nice big hunks of orange rind, which I love.;neutral
Who doesn't love a jolly rancher? The only place I can find the five-pound bags locally is the office supply super store....this is a much better deal, especially if you have prime.;neutral
My husband likes this flavor.  I do not.  It tastes like childhood 60's flavored medicine.  However, we both drink a zip fizz every morning to help get going and wake up.  Much healthier than Diet Coke!;neutral
The item arrived in excellent conditions. The three stars are for the product taste. Taste good with vanilla ice cream, but it is too greasy for me. Not sure I will eat all.;neutral
"Flavour was a bit ""off"" for shortbread.  Nice size for presentation and serving.";neutral
I received these yesterday I'm excited to try this in recipes for the first time....only concerned over. Product description, and what I received;neutral
It's ok, it could have more flavor.;neutral
Leaves a funny after taste. Definitely need to mix it with fresh or frozen fruit and a sweetener like agave for a healthy shake.;neutral
for a mass produced bread, it serves its purpose, for a reasonable price.;neutral
I bought this sweetener for my son, he likes it, however, finding empty sealed packets inside the bag is not cool. For this reason, I am giving it 3 stars, and I will not buy the packets again.;neutral
Glad I tried them but not sure I would order again;neutral
"Product is great; but they melt being left outside.  Don't recommend buying them for delivery.";neutral
The tea doesn't taste like salted caramel.  It's a pleasant tasting vanilla.  I think this company just used the name because salted caramel is so hot right now.;neutral
May just be my taste but I was not overwhelmed here by taste, and it is a tiny seriving.  It is convenient to pop in micro.;neutral
This is just an okay product.  I was hoping for a good smokey smell and flavor, but it honestly didn't make the grade.;neutral
Well they aren't bad or anything and are quite filling but a bit bland.  So I dipped them in pumpkin spice cream cheese spread and they tasted pretty good.  Even so though, Just okay for me.;neutral
Good unless you get a rancid package, which I did after ordering several packages of good ( not rancid ) packages.;neutral
The expiration date on these was not okay, but the product is alright. My mother uses it in her shakes to add more protein, but would not eat it by itself.;neutral
They are the yummy cookies I remember but all arrived broken.;neutral
"Smells like candy, tastes very, very tart.

Edit: MUCH better cold, not very good hot.";neutral
It's ok but I did not like the taste ,;neutral
Disappointed that 10-15% are halves and pieces.  Obviously Planters QC standards are not set high. Sea salt or whatever,  still a bit too salty also. Will NOT reorder.;neutral
I love this rice but a little disappointed the shelf life ends in January, 2017. I could never use that much rice by then.;neutral
easy to use but difficult to get cleaned and sometimes the tea is very weak and sometimes way to strong;neutral
"These cookies were a bit dry but the over all taste was good, i would purchase them again.
Great with coffee, tea or just milk.";neutral
It's just OK. Doesn't have great flavor like the non-decaf version of this coffee. A bit disappointed but will drink the box.;neutral
"I use this item as an emergency ""go to get a guick bite""...not an every week snack.";neutral
Purchased these on advice from Dr. Oz.  They are a good snack food and tasty as well.  The price is the reason I would consider to re-purchase or not.;neutral
Some of the k-cups seem to have a metallic taste that some people talk about. I don't know if I would buy this again because of the metallic taste.;neutral
These taste great, for sure. But I have to agree that there's not a whole lot of jerky for the cost. But I guess that's to be expected with salmon.;neutral
"This is more of a puree consistency, I would have liked to have had larger chunks.
Also very very sweet. Upside you get a lot and you can reuse the Jar.
Not worth the money.";neutral
This tastes good but some of the shells are inadequately split for easy opening.;neutral
Didn't have much of the sriracha flavor for me, just tasted eh. Much like any other spicy jerky.;neutral
just okay...I have had better chocolate chip bars..--but not bad Either.;neutral
These do not look or taste the same as regular peanut beer nuts, but they're still pretty good. I added sea salt to mine and I liked them better salted. ;neutral
Very stron ginger, but is what the doctor ordered.;neutral
This was my first experience with Gevalia coffee.  It was adequate, but much too weak. I found the French Roast much better.;neutral
Just okay. Not strong enough for me.;neutral
the product itself is good (ingredients), but the taste is ok personally their gummy bunnies taste better and my daughter prefers the gummy bunnies too.;neutral
It is pretty good, but not quite as flavorful as I had hoped.;neutral
I was looking for something to spice up tea and/or hot chocolate, but there's two problems. One, the ginger is almost invisible and two, I hadn't expected it to be sweetened.;neutral
"Did not know ""NO Strings"" attached to the tea bags, augh!  Thought the price was too good to be true, well I use this is my travel mug and don't want to burn myself getting the bag in and out";neutral
Don't know about this as I ordered it for someone else.;neutral
love these cookiers but half are broken;neutral
Good Product, but a little to heavy for my taste, So I have to add much more water.;neutral
Product is good but not a value for me to get through the mail.;neutral
And too large of a package for honey roasted. You feel very full afterward. They also have a very heavy, sweet taste.;neutral
I was expecting some citrus flavor, of course, but much stronger lime flavor than I had envisioned.;neutral
This is good stuff the reason for three stars is it taste like it is smoked not just dried;neutral
The price is a little much but being that we were overseas what other choice did we have? The flavor we good, nice and spacey. But you need to change the price.;neutral
Sweet but not as much peppermint flavor. We won't buy again.;neutral
So I take the packets to a restaurant but I need scissors to open.  Really hard to open without scissors.;neutral
these were OK. probably just the same as a fruit roll up but you pay the organic up sell price;neutral
The flavor is good, but it doesn't last long.  The price is a bit high.;neutral
It tastes like almond milk. Unfortunately it has to many additives. I wish Amazon fresh had better options.;neutral
A small amount for alot of money,  need to find an India Market  (they are all over the cities)  where it is used all the time and at about 1/4 of the cost of more.;neutral
Very stong taste.  It was OK but not what I expected!;neutral
its pistachios, and it tastes good,  had to say more to get the 18 words required to get this to work.;neutral
smaller than I thought - otherwise delicious!;neutral
Not very coconuty which was disappointing. Mix it with fruity flavors and coconut la Croix and it is pretty good then.;neutral
This tea was ok, but not as good as Numi.  Now obviously Numi is 6 dollars more, but well worth it.  Maybe I got a bad batch.  Either way I'll be sticking with Numi for now on.;neutral
Hmmm. Not exactly tasty and a bit hard to chew. But they kind of grow on you and not that bad when you get used to them. Worthy of the healthy benefits.;neutral
some of the chocolate was old and the bottoms were white, I didn't eat them.;neutral
It's OK, but it's cheaper just to use strong coffee and cardamom.;neutral
Cookies and cream in truffle form. Not bad but I prefer Hershey's.;neutral
I had high hopes, but these didn't taste good at all. So sad.;neutral
It was ok. Very little in the bag maybe 4 strips.;neutral
I do not like the taste. Not good rice as promoted.;neutral
I found it poor to just OK. It was grainy & not smooth!;neutral
Too many carbs for serving size. 8.4 ounce box has 17 servings with 5 grams net carbs.;neutral
Good tasting but very thin viscosity.;neutral
Good for baking. Not for straight eating.;neutral
In my opinion the gum taste nasty. The gum does not have sugar and that is what I wanted but the taste is not for my taste-buds .;neutral
Interesting attempt, and while this is not one of my personal favorite, everyone has different preferences.  If you are a chocolate lover, give these a try!;neutral
Lavazza in general has a little 'off' flavor to all of their coffees.  PASS.;neutral
These are not the same as the ones I bought last year.  They are ok but not as hot or long lasting and a bit too small.;neutral
Cheaper than the whole pieces, thought I try it.  Seems a bit greasy for dry roasted.;neutral
It's hummus, alright, but the taste is a little off. I much prefer my local store brand. Pairs nicely with pita chips just like every other hummus on the planet.;neutral
Decent coffee, but not quite the same complexity and flavor as most other bali sourced coffee beans.  Bali has so many different types of coffee that it's worth trying something else other than this one;neutral
Looks like what you feed a pet rabbit. Tastes good. Doesn't last long. The chewing consistency is a bit off.;neutral
not as good as the first time I bought  before to expensive too;neutral
it's good just not what I expected,,,;neutral
should call it apple cranberry.  it's a bit sweet. I like my cranberry juice TART and this is not.;neutral
Good coffee. Not even close to a brazilian cofee but it is still nice.;neutral
thought I enjoy the product for quality taste, very uncomfortable that the majority of the cans in my shipment arrived with  dents in the cans;neutral
Nothing extraordinary about those sticks. They feel that they taste the same no matter what the flavor was.;neutral
Nicely prepared and not mushy, the Galil Stuffed Vine Leaves are nonetheless a bit salty for my taste. The leaves maintain their integrity without being too coarse or large-veined.;neutral
Very gluey tasting with not much flavor. Look around for something better...;neutral
Flavors well but as time goes on it loses clarity and becomes a cloudy white liquid. Why?;neutral
Too Expensive and need a lot to give a taste.;neutral
Like most preserved lemongrass this does not really have much of that characteristic lemongrass taste. Because it is a Thai product I tried it, but it is not any better than most.;neutral
The product is good but Planters is much better, when available at a reasonable price.;neutral
I'd give it 1 star but my wife gives it 5 stars. It tastes like chocolate syrup (e.g. Hershey's, Bosco, or U-Bet) rather than actual chocolate. If that's your thing, buy it.;neutral
They were just OK. Kinda stinky and didn't taste awful but won't buy again.;neutral
OK- but many were broken or cracked-;neutral
The taste is good, but there are always so many husks in with the oats.  I'd give this 5 stars if it weren't for that.;neutral
The taste is on the buttery side, but somehow it doesn't suit my taste for a great butterscotch candy.;neutral
SUPER STRONG, use lightly or ad a bit of salt to cut the bitterness.;neutral
The peanut butter chocolate Glucerna is much better. This has an odd taste.;neutral
AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT THAT IS QUITE ADDICTIVE.;neutral
The eyes are the only cute ones to use on cupcakes or other baked goods.;neutral
This coffee leaves a bit of a bitter after taste.;neutral
For hot chocolate I think that there would be better options. If you are cooking and the receipe calls for chocolate than I think that this would work fine.;neutral
Not sweet at all. I need just a touch of sweetener. This is great, but no sweetening.;neutral
Is Ok not as flavorful as other blue mountain coffee I has tried.;neutral
"not enough ""pop"" for the buck, tasted great though.";neutral
Very nice taste but had to chill the candy in the fridge. The wrapper kept sticking to the caramels and it was very annoying. Don't know if I would buy again.;neutral
expiration date was soon after arrival;neutral
Not as much flavor as I was expecting.  I have only used it twice.  If you think mild teas - you will probably enjoy;neutral
this is good,but i thought i was buying ginger beer;neutral
It's OK. It is spicy and too sweet for me.;neutral
Novel concept - cocoa with mocha flavor.  Insipid without adding some cream, and sugar.;neutral
Tasty healthy snacks that we purchased to take on our trip to Maui.  They are good, but they are a bit difficult to chew.  I will not be buying these again.;neutral
I really like the flavor of this gum but it only lasts for about 3 minutes and then you feel like you're chewing plastic. I wish the flavor lasted longer.;neutral
Taste good but they had pitts. I almost broke a tooth;neutral
These are delicious and healthy.  But I've ordered 3 times, and each time the sticks are significantly shorter.  They're now just over half the length of my first order.;neutral
it is okay, not wonderful, not awful;neutral
The product is fine, the price is BS. $3 at Trader Joe'.;neutral
Wonderfully clean flavor, I am very happy with this purchase. It is organic and taste amazingly delicious. Will buy again and again.;positive
Wish I stumbled on this earlier.  Makes rich, creamy smoothies.;positive
These are delicious and quite healthy. They're basically whole nuts with a bit of chocolate for sweetness.  One bar has lots of protein and only 200 calories. The perfect afternoon snack.;positive
Really, really good!  Great flavor and crunch = our favorite is the apple.  Strawberries and bananas really tart.;positive
Great grape leaves even tried them in a layered crock pot recipe rather than wrapping them.;positive
Bacon is great in anything? This was maybe too baconey? I really don't know what to say further on this subject, but try it and see what you think. It is different.;positive
I chew gum all day. This gum is easy to chew & soft. Keeps flavor for longer than other gums.;positive
The quality of these hot dogs is good, but 7 in a pack?  Come on, just put one more in there to make it match the package of buns and charge a few cents more.;positive
This is pretty tasty. There are nice sized pieces of clam in it. The potatoes are soft  - not hard as bricks like in some other brands. I would buy it again.;positive
We love this flavor! I was introduced to this brand when I bought the jerky gun. It had 5 packs in with it. A simple process that gives plenty of flavor! A must have choice for all jerky makers!;positive
These are so delicious and we have nut allergies so snacks like these are usually a no but thank goodness for this product.  Kids love them and they are healthy.;positive
I use this mostly on edamame beans, with some salt.  However, if I'm disappointed in a new recipe I try, I consider sprinkling a little of this to save it from being boring.;positive
Received today, excellent condition.;positive
My family cannot live without this product.  We don't use sugar at all and this is the best replacement we've found.;positive
Delicious! Great ingredient for chef salad! I will reorder this many times. Great for low carb lifestyle. Thanks again Amazon for a great product!;positive
I have bought this brittle over and over. So good.;positive
These pretzel sticks are crispy, light and nicely salted. They're well worth the Amazon price!;positive
I love Nips especially when you were selling them for a dollar. I will be purchasing your products in the future.;positive
Tart and sweet - great taste sensation.  Love it!;positive
"My grandkids love these and I don't feel guilty about allowing this 'sofa'. ;)";positive
A light refreshing snack or desert.  The container is not that large, but the quality is definitely worth the money.;positive
was a father's day present and he loved it;positive
Yummy drinks. Great for our toddlers lunch.;positive
Love being able to have a soda treat without extra calories and artificial junk;positive
"Because of the health benefit as well as the great taste on my popcorn.
I use this on my skin as well as cooking.
Also is good for my famlies alzheimers.";positive
Ordered the light meant ot order the regular.  Its true that it has no flavor like the regular and is sweet but I like the regular better;positive
Fantastic.  One of the best herbal teas you can buy.  Price is great on Amazon.;positive
Very large box equal to three regular size box. Not very handy to put on shelf.;positive
Great buns and they stay fresh longer than the value brands.;positive

I am a huge fan of pasta, and if you follow the cooking instructions on the package these brown rice shells are THE TOP.;positive

My Dad thought it was the best fruit cake he's had;positive

All products in this line are excellent!  I make sure we always have a few boxes in the cupboard for a quick meal on a cold day.;positive
Fabulous favor blend - wish it was organic!!;positive
One of my favorite flavors.  You cannot make chili taste like chili without it.  Cumin can turn most any dish into a wonderful treat.;positive

Excellent!  If you like gummy type things.  Just right -  firm but easy to bite and chew.  I love the twangy taste!  You can't eat just one.;positive

These are my downfall.  I absolutely love these, but I try to pace myself with them.;positive

Great Goji's that I have with chocolate and coffee in the morning.;positive
The aroama is very strong but the taste is subtle. Taste good even after it goes cold. No after taste goes well with pastries. no sugar needed even though I usually like sugar in my tea,;positive
These are so good!  The caramel isn't soft. But isn't hard. Kind of like a tootsie roll. Maybe a tiny bit harder. The chocolate inside is so yummy!;positive
The strawberries taste great, kind of like the strawberries in cereal. There is not a ton in the bag compared to the price. That is the reason for 4 stars.;positive
Great gluten free pasta.  I highly recommend it.;positive

Excellent flavor and great price, I will repurchase this item so keep it available.;positive

It was a gift for our son who was visiting from AIT / U.S. Army and he just loved the chocolates.;positive
What a great value for a great product! almond extract usually looses a lot of it's flavor when baked, but this extract is great!;positive
I like this tea but then again like the other flavor Yogi has, it tastes sweet and didn't know that it has caffeine. I cannot drink this as much due to the caffeine content but I will drink it occasionally.;positive
Hummus time in the kitchen.  Thought we'd try this Tahini and it seems to work well.;positive
I have loved moon pies since I was a kid. These mini moon pies are just the right size.;positive
Does require mixing, but that is what is expected with no additives. I love it, but my husband does not. He likes peanut butter to be sweet. I just want a natural butter.;positive
Delicious and then the price went up! The end;positive
These were individually wrapped and tasted fresh and nice;positive
Delicious, easy, and safe snack for allergic children!;positive
Because I'm still waiting for the potato starch flour, I've been able to make the bread recipe yet.  So, I'm sure it'll be great once I can use it!;positive
I love these...I wish the reduced fat Cheez Its came in extra toasty!;positive
I love dry roasted seaweed and this is one the best I've had so far!;positive
Very handy around the kitchen - good value;positive

Great flavors.  Perfect with coffee mate creamer.;positive
"Really great. You really feel better
Put a little in tea";positive
Blueberry is my husbands favorite pie so i ordered a cas.e.  The filling is thick with fruit with just the right level of sweetness.  Really good.;positive

I like this Green tea and would recommend it.  Will probably not drink as much in summer but again might make it ice tea.;positive
The Best Honey.  This honey is RAW--REALLY RAW!  Don't be deceived by others that have been heated.;positive

Love it glad to have this big one I keep it frozen and take a handful at a time its so delicious.;positive
A very tasting blend of quality peppercorns.  I will buy these again.;positive
This is the biggest cereal box I've ever seen.;positive

I love the taste and so convenient when I want something other than coffee.  Have purchased several boxes and will continue to buy...;positive
A good mix of teas including some herbal and decaf. The ones I have tried are great;positive

Great stuff! I didn't know if I was going to like powdered peanut butter, or if it worked, or how it tasted, but I liked it, it works, and it tastes great!;positive
A bit too sweet, but otherwise taste great.;positive
"Much much better than ""sugar free"" and ""fake"" sugar chemical gum! I am glad to find a product that has flavor and is not filled with Junk!";positive
I have ordered so many bags of Davidson's tea.  Just love this one for tea time...no caffeine to keep me awake at night.  Takes a bit of time to leech the tea out of the leaves so let it steep.;positive
Bold like I enjoy, but there seemed to be some grinds on the bottom of my coffee cup.;positive
Very nice quality smoked salt, I buy lots of smoked salts, and this flavor is real smooth tasting. Love it.;positive
This jerky is one of the better dry/tough ones that I have eaten. I do not care for the wet ones.;positive

A bit darker than the regular milk-chocolate version, but not too dark.;positive

Price is right and a quick healthy lunch item in my pantry..;positive
The Italian roast is less bitter than the French roast and I drink it everyday but I will still search for the perfect cup by buying smaller batches while still staying stocked up on this.;positive
Love the ease of this liquid stevia. Love the brand and organic option!;positive
Probably my favorite coffee for a basic daily cup.;positive
can not get locally, great price and taste;positive

Add to a glass and then around 2 tbsp of sugar.";positive
"Convenient, tasty and a healthy addition to any ""Trail Mix""...";positive
very nice tea, good price. Fast shipping;positive
I use it to enhance the coffee flavor.. 3/4 of a teaspoon is adequate and too much will make coffee too greasy.;positive
The honey is so fresh and lovely. Brilliant flavor. Just a little over priced.;positive
No dyes or chemicals and works great.;positive
Important to use if you have filtered water. I have a reverse osmosis water purifier that removes all the minerals. Need this.;positive
"This was a gift, came in a cute tin for the holidays. The recipient told me the cookies were ""great"" and she is a cookie lover!";positive
I mix in with oatmeal, grits and popcorn instead of butter.  I also use 1/2 parmesan cheese and 1/2 nutrional yeast on pasta.;positive
If you buy the cans a lot, just get this box and refill. So good!;positive
best bet for organic beans. Pouch is easy to store and use. Will buy again;positive

The best raisins with chocolate. WOW!;positive
The pearls transform into a light and flavorful tea. It is quite satisfying, and does best if the leaves are removed after a short steep.;positive

In a pinch these will work if you need a SERIOUS KICK?;positive
"I have been using these in just a random fashion daily with whatever I cook and I must admit that they are pure joy.

this product is exactly what I wanted and the price was much better than in the stores in my area.;positive
"Don't like most ""jerky"" products but this brand is YUMMY! No chemical or smokey taste";positive
I couldn't be more pleased.  This is the best quality vanilla extract I have ever tried.  This is a HUGE bottle so I cleaned and refilled the first, smaller bottle to make it easier to measure from.;positive
Even better for a buck than most others;positive
Delicious. Plus this is the only artificial sweetener my stomach can tolerate.;positive
Nice tea bags, but they were a gift and the box was a little smashed up.  Tried to fix it as best I could.  Turned out to be fine.;positive
Great product! I use it for all my cooking and baking needs.;positive
Tastes great. Works fine in the Kurig at work, but takes 2 try's at 6 oz setting to get most of the product out in the K55 I have at home. Home unit may not have as high water pressure.;positive
I liked it very much. great for mixed drinks and adding flavor to anything that needs that extra coconut flavor, even cakes and icings.;positive
This one will zap your eyes wide open in the am.  A tad acidic, but not overwhelming.  Nothing worse than weak coffee, even though this is not espresso blast;positive
It tastes very good, but not the best I've ever had. I give it a B+. It is a little bit stronger than I like.;positive
"Ice coffee with milk, without having to carry around the dairy product and needing a refrig.
Great for the office or classroom.";positive
"Delicious cookies, the only down side is they're addicting.
Country Choice Organic Vanilla Sandwich Cremes, 12-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)";positive
I love this product, and it made a wonderful sope, but it took about three days to dissolve in water, which is ok because the crystals are so big.  It tastes great too.;positive
These were delicious. Well packed etc.;positive
Great for making vegan nut cheese.  This little package goes a long way .... Do not be deceived by the size.;positive
Great toasted flavor and melt in your mouth---actually the gently crunch/fall apart in your mouth. I will reorder soon since I am devouring them daily.;positive
I love these noodles...made a wonderful AIP friendly mai fun.;positive
I'm not a die hard cheese person.  I can live without most cheeses.  However, I always have feta cheese in my refrigerator.  Treasure Cave is delicious.;positive
Could be a bit stronger vanilla accent;positive
The plain and chocolate are great. The root beer is ok. There is more sweet than flavor, which is perfect for me.;positive
These are delicious, they are ready in three minutes, I have type 2 diabetes and I`m on Adkins diet there is no sugar spike. They are not cheap but for my cravings I love them.;positive
I love this new green srircha sauce!! It has a different taste and heat level than its red brother. More of a fresh pepper taste.;positive
Great variety of coffees however, contains decaff which never get used.;positive
Bought to divy up in gifts with personalized mugs. I ended up with a few extra. Even the flavors that didn't sound appealing to me I ended up likinv a lot. Great assortment.;positive
powdered organic milk powder...perfect for baking or cooking when you don't have milk in the house...;positive
These are the most addictive things in the universe...besides crack;positive
great drink mixes and this is a reorder;positive
We eat far too many of these. They are quick to warm up in the microwave. They are sweet and savory. They are lower fat than pork sausage. Depending on your level of Kosher, they are that too. Lots to love.;positive
"Love the taste.  A naturopath told me coffee is one of the heavily sprayed with pestisides and if you go organic it helps to lower your blood pressure.
That does appear to be the case at least for me.";positive
Some reviews seem to indicate these are not like the ones of old we ate in the UK years ago. I think it's a case of memory. I find them the same. Not too sweet and a bit dry, just like they used to be!.;positive
Is it the best jerky in the world? No. But it's pretty good and it allows me to get my jerky fix for a good price.;positive
Good price, fast shipping, just what I was looking for.;positive
We needed some in bulk because we use them to catch our chipmunks as well, we had a lot this year!!  They are a great size and fresh.;positive
some of the flavors have to go on a little heavy to get good flavor, but aside from that, this is a really good product.;positive
A fun and big bag full of tootsie pops to fill the trick or treat bowl up with nicely! Hides all the chocolate for me to eat later lol (just kidding);positive
"Love these White Chocolate Reese's I only wish Reese's would make a ""Big Cup"" in these.";positive
This GUM is the BEST! I was looking for a gum that was healthier for me. I really like the flavor. As other has noted the flavor doesnt last long but it is still great gum.;positive
Fantastic! Great flavor and a good way to knock the hunger out!;positive
You absolutely can not beat this price.  The grocery store vanilla extract is too expensive.  This will last you a long time.  I will get again and recommend.;positive
Wow.  Just wow.  The finish is excellent and have turned Green Beans into a treat for the kids and parents alike.  Thank you!;positive
Who doesn't love Planters nuts. They were fresh.;positive

Light, sugary confections, made with quality ingredients; very good.";positive
GOOD, WOULD BUY AGAIN IF ONLY IT HAD MORE FLAVOR, SO FAINT;positive
Each envelope is a surprise flavor because we cannot read Japanese. Fun for young kids. Too many teddy bears and kitties for older kids. Would buy again. The furikake itself is good.;positive
In my case, I purchased more than I needed with this particular package size, but the product was great quality.;positive
I use it to make pancakes and it works fine;positive
So convenient in a spray and not too large that you can't tote to work! Love the bottles :);positive
I hate paying big bucks for small jars at the grocers... this package is a better value and I use it to refill my small working bottle. McCormick has always been a favored brand for dry spices.;positive
I love the healthy snack.  It is a great tasting seaweed snack with just a touch of salt.  It does have a mild fish flavor, so if you don't like that, it's not a good one for you.;positive
Very nice sweet-sour fruit flavored. 20 cals a piece;positive
This is my second time of buying this brand...they have a good amount of heat and don't have the funny smell to them that some other brands have.;positive
This is a great tasting tea and my daughter and I drink it every night.;positive
Love these chips. The minis are great for my mini paleo muffins...  I add just a couple of tablespoons of chips and they satisfy my sweet tooth without being too bad for the waistline.;positive
The best value I can find anywhere. It is great quality and bulk size. I have ordered this 3 times now and will continue to do so.;positive
They're great, but to small of a snack for me...I need all 5 bags:)....A+++++;positive
I Love this assortment!! So much better then the crazy cups assortment amazon sells!;positive
"nice, light foam topping; slightly sweet";positive
My girls loved this product, but we found it on sale at Marshalls a lot cheaper.  Can't complain about the quality, it is really very delicious.;positive
The price point is better here than in the store. Great coffee.;positive
Bold, bright, with a bit of a smokey finish. Will definitely purchase again.;positive
I start my day with lapsang souchong to get going, but then I drink prob 5-8 of these a day/night and I really appreciate Amazon having this on Prime and Subscribe & Save.;positive
Love this product, but be warned...use sparingly as it somehow seems saltier than regular table salt;positive
I love this coffee and I am a avid Starbucks person. this coffee is the only coffee I will drink at home.;positive

Makes delicious smoothies and great in cereal or yogurts;positive
It's hard to find a really bold K-cup unless you use 2 cups per cup of coffee.  This one fits the bill.  Extra bold but without any bitterness.;positive
No sugar needed but to get the full likeness of picking fresh black raspberries, a little sugar is needed.  Brews well in cold water. One of the best tastes from summer!;positive
Yes its worth the wait, glad I bought 3 boxes.  Bought 4 Japanese cookbooks for my Kindle and Instant Dashi makes it go much faster.  Also for tempura dipping sauce.  Worth the wait!;positive
Love this mix. We alway find new way to use it,  Good flavor and texture for pancakes. Works well to alter for light or heavier batters.;positive
This soup mix makes the BEST dip there is for vegetables.  I am so glad to be able to get it again.;positive

These are excellent fruit bars with loads of fiber - real flavor, real blueberries, very moist, not like many fiber bars that are reminiscent of cardboard. No corn syrup and other nasty stuff in them, either.;positive

"These are good, but not quite as good as the Haribro Gummi Candi gold bears.
I definitely would still recommend them.";positive
This is a nice, fresh product, at a very good price.  I add some to my smoothies, and often to baked goods.  Sesame seeds are beneficial for arthritis, among other things.;positive

"I use this in by ""breakfast cereal mix"". Good amount at a fair price-so I'm ready when it's needed! Enjoy!";positive
Better than a fig Newton.  If you love figs, these are the best.;positive
Works wonderful when making pizza. Especially when using Caputo 00 flour. Just like the pizza you had in Naples. (Italy, not Florida.);positive
Dizzy Pig makes awesome rubs for everything.  This is our favorite for grilled salmon. Just rub some on the fish and grill it -- what could be simpler?  The bottles are sizeable and last awhile.;positive

Great for autumn and winter.";positive

These are as good as they look...even better. Very classy.;positive

You MUST have this sauce. Not super spicy, and a little bit sweet. Great to toss on anything and a great addition to soups / stews as well.;positive

It was a gift that was well received.;positive
This is high quality soy sauce its flavor is the best I've ever had this is the only soy sauce I own now;positive

These jelly beans are SO good! Organic so I don't feel so bad giving them to my kids but addicting. I can't get enough of them.;positive
We liked it, the bag was cute. I think for the money we enjoy other coffees more. Tried it with my Chemex as well as my  drip brewer and it was good.;positive

Great taste for such a bargain price;positive

Put this in my tea every morning. Love the citrus flavor. Only annoying thing in the peel remnants at the bottom of the cup.;positive
I love these packets, especially in sparkling water or club soda. They have a nice,light taste.;positive

Yummy stuff, I used it to make homemade chocolate bars, and they were so melt in your mouth decadent.;positive

Tasty coffee shipped on time and was an add-on item, so priced well.  No complaints.;positive
I love these almonds because I can soak and sprout them! Then dehydrate for easier digestion! Great product. Taste delicious!;positive
I have been making sourdough bread thanks to this starter. It was easy to get started and the instructions were easy to follow.;positive

This is very good, its filling and not a lot of calories or sugar.;positive

Excellent price.  Used to be able to get this at wegmans, but now they sell a relish instead of the pickle.  This is much better!;positive

I don't have a candy drawer.  I have four:  two at home and two at work, and these are proudly featured in each, as God intended.;positive
This makes my bread nice and fluffy :);positive
I prefer strong black tea but this is a flavorful tea with a lovely pear taste.  The loose tea (rather than a bag) allows one to make it stronger or weaker as desired.;positive
Our Family lives on a military base outside the US, organic foods are not as easy to get here. We love these green beans and have them as a subscription.  They taste great and come in a convenient can.;positive
Great deal. Bought 2 packs. I opened the outer wrapping and with the 2 packages I have 4 individually wrapped boxes of chocolates. Very nice for gift giving.;positive
These taste good, but don't seem to help with nausea very much.  I was so disappointed, but I have a nice chewable candy for after dinner.;positive

Has a very pleasant taste - like tea - not sweet just relaxing and delicious.
Try it";positive

What can I say about Tastykakes? They are the best, and remind me of Philly. Always fresh and yummy. I stick them in the fridge right after I get them, and can't help but to grab for one every day.;positive
Love this stuff! Light and sweet but not to sweet. I use it instead of sugar or honey and it works well.;positive
As I have mentioned in another review for Traditional Medicinals, this is one of the only brands I trust to not use bleach in their bags. This is a great sampler for the sick season.;positive

Delicious - can't stop eating them.  Almost gone.;positive
"This is my favorite for summertime iced tea.  I sometimes add a bit of juice to enhance the flavor, or add rock sugar.  Love sipping it outside as I relax in late afternoon, reading a ""beach"" book.";positive
I am a coffee lover and this blend is quite nice. A variety of different level of roasts to make a smooth cup of coffee. A great value as well.;positive
No aftertaste, convenient pre-measured packets, portable plus a good supply for use at home... what's not to love?  The price per packet is very reasonable, too.;positive

This has a lot of flavor for my wake-up coffee.  I love intense extra-holds for later in the day sipping.  This is not as bold as those, but more flavorful than your standard breakfast blend,;positive

Delicious - nice bit of fibery fruit material in there also.;positive
I enjoy this product the taste was fresh and e all the military enjoyed it. Great Taste  Ebveryone enjoy the Honey roasted one the best;positive
Just ran out, great popcorn. Use it in a air popcorn maker so have to spray with olive oil etc...but organic is healthier than GMO so definitely recommend it.;positive

Can grind these to make your own fresh sprouted flour for bread. Yum;positive

I love this coconut oil! And it is a great deal. I use it for many of my natural products I make.;positive

Love the flavor of popcorn with this seasoning salt. Much better than plain salt and much closer to movie theater.;positive
The first bag I purchased was perfect and tasted fresh, sadly the second order I purchased was hard and partially stale in flavor. Of course I will continue buying these over Haribo due to the larger bag.;positive
"Great product. Typical of all of Newman's products.
I wonder why I can't submit a short review?
I have to add 3 more words.

So hard to find decent candies these days but these rank among some of my favorites;positive
The ONLY problem I had with it was that it was to good to have just 1 serving.;positive
Just when all the hype is coming out about the benefits of coconut oil. Even heard it's part of curing Alzheimer's Disease. We eat it right out of the can, bake/cook with it, and use it as moisturizer too!;positive

Adds a smoky element to meat cooked in the oven.;positive
Great flavor for the price - would give 5 star if price per cup is under. 48/cup;positive

love that there's a cake mix I can whip up for my kids that I don't feel guilty about them eating, and I can leave out the egg (or use egg replacer) with little to no issues;positive
"OK---but better flavors at better prices out there.............but also worse products out there. This one is about a ""B"" in my opinion.";positive
. I have attached a picture of the cake before and after I added the topper. This worked great on my sons birthday cake looked wonderful all the kids loved it;positive
While I do not drink flavored coffee, my nephews loved it.  I have had the unflavored Green Mountain coffee and it is great too.;positive
This one is ok, but I could take it or leave it. Leaves a slight aftertaste.;positive

Because we eat a lot of split pea soup, I was glad to find it in bulk. These taste fresh and cook up great. Arrived a few days after ordering.;positive
Yes, its expensive.  But, I've given up my daily (sometimes more) trip to that huge coffee chain and replaced it with this.  Just a enough sugar to made it enjoyable.  You need to sip it to fully appreciate.;positive

My favorite type of soda as it is not overly sweet and goes with everything.;positive

Once again a delicious snack and healthy product.  I wish there were more.  Mine disappeared. No one saying anything. ( Who ate the beans?);positive
I have had no problems with my pods. I simply keep the Kuerig K55 clean. Holes at bottom of spout9pod holder) will plug with certain beverages, for sure the chocolate, non coffee drinks.;positive

my chicken is not chicken unless this stuff is used, always in our kitchen;positive
My brother loved it. Said the nuts were very tasty & fresh.;positive
Good hot chocolate. Looking for the best tasting hot chocolate.;positive
Tastes pretty good but not worth the price. About $4 per bag is a bit steep but in all fairness, freeze dried food in general is pricy.;positive
this was very good and I happy with the order;positive
French lentils are so much better than regular lentils.  Seems like a huge premium for beans, but definitely worth it for taste!  I've both this brand for years and you can't go wrong!;positive

I love dried Mangoes so much that I think I might go crazy if when I run out. The only reason why I don't keep them in stock is because they are so expensive.;positive
Strong as expected. Very nice bold flavor and when you put the Keurig on 6 oz this reminds me of espresso...Great for a jolt of caffeine.;positive
These added to some warm apple cider just make you warm all over and taste great.;positive

Delicious alone or to make Nutella. Love it.;positive

We love this popcorn as there are very few kernels (grannies) that don't pop.;positive

i am NOT a dark chocolate fan, but man this stuff is good!  i received a sample in a subscription box i get every month, and immediately ordered a set of bars.  delish!;positive
My review is the same for all these spices for organic, no salt spices. Hope this helps with your choices.;positive
This almond flour is so light that I use it for most of my baking.  Most gluten free baked goods are dense and heavy. My banana bread is moist and light with this flour.;positive
I love this stuff. I think I'll go have some now!;positive
Family loves it... great for quick snack / bar before workout , walk , hike, etc..;positive
Great product for all of the gluten free individuals!  Thank you McCormick!;positive

I couldn't imagine going through life without beer nuts. Thee are very tasty and I really enjoy them. I would highly recommend them.;positive
Really strong but that's the point of this coffee right?;positive
Very much a fudgy-chocolate taste here.  Really tasty, but gets to be too much for a morning cup about halfway thru.  Much better as an afternoon treat or a dessert coffee.;positive
Love these more than Prince of Peace original ginger candies!;positive
No problems with this product.  Actually got it for my garden to keep away pests that don't like it!;positive
I got the Hot Tamales on time, I use the candy for my candy machine business and customers love them, great buy.;positive

My only complaint is that it was only 4 pounds of almonds instead of more. Arguably the best purchase I've made so far in 2016.;positive
Nice, can be bitter if you use a lot of sugar or are used to sweets.  Good chocolate flavor.;positive
A little harder than usual but still delicious anyways!;positive
Amazing coffee! I can definitely tell the difference between this and my usual coffee because of the nootropics used. Great stuff!;positive

OK, this is a trick question, right? These are excellent!! Send more! lol Please?;positive

I enjoyed it far more than I expected it is much better in a envelope than a can;positive

This drink is sooo refreshing.  I share with my friend, and she loves it too.  It has a really bright taste, set off by the lemon in the drink.;positive

Of the two roasts, regular and Peruvian Dark, this is my favorite! I definitely will reorder. The beans were so fresh!;positive
Very comforting chamomile flavor. Brewed perfectly with boiling water and 4:30 of steeping. Definitely a staple in my tea cache!;positive

Super price when on sale, however, I buy it all the time anyway;positive
Better than Zantac.....soothing and refreshing, even iced. I make a cup the moment I feel any stomach distress or at the first sign of a cold/flu.;positive
The best store bought pecans I've purchased. Back in the 50s and 60s my family owned a pecan plantation in Georgia...so I know good pecans.  I wish the bag was bigger because I go through them quickly.;positive

These are good quality chia seeds and are good for you.  This is a good purchase as you save a little money buying bulk.  I will buy these again.;positive
The idea of seltzer or club soda is to be carbonated and easily utilized. The slight lime touch imparts a hint of flavor. A good choice.;positive

The taste is ok but is a powdered mix in a kcup;positive
Its an acquired flavor for non tea drinkers, but great drink once you get used to it. Earthly flavor. For teabag pu erh tea, it has rich flavor.;positive
came to me melted together but it was fun to eat! Very tasty!!!!!;positive
Love these chocolates!  Purchase every year for little stocking stuffer gifts for the people who do services for me - mailman, paperboy, etc.  Buy one for them and one for me!!!  Hard to eat just one!;positive
Tasty white chocolate with matcha. Product is always fresh. Wish for either more tea flavor or less butteriness of the chocolate itself. Pleasant with a cup of matcha though.;positive
Great price. I love cooking with this it is so not greasy tastes great and I get the health benefits as well.;positive
It's nice to have an all natural (and in this case, organic) treat for your kids. I would have given 5 stars if I didn't think the price was a little steep for lollipops!;positive
Beautiful rich colors in a concentrated gel.  Can't wait to decorate Christmas cookies.;positive
I love two varieties of this tea (chamomile and spring jasmine).  The teabags are large and hold quite a bit of tea leaves which allows you to have a relatively large cup of tea (~16 oz) with complete flavor.;positive
So good!!! You will not be able to put them down. I could not stop eating them. Very tasty and so yummy!;positive
Easy to grab a handful for a healthy late afternoon snack.;positive
The taste is mild, I like that. I use them in my oatmeal cereal they are soft when heated.  I will also put them in my ice cream.  I brought this bag for my cousin who is enjoying them also.;positive
"I know I ordered them and I knew they would arrive today but it was still a great surprise.

I love Brazil Nuts. Ready to eat the 2lbs.";positive
taste good, but doesnt dissolve well or easily in cold liquids;positive
"It's healthy and it tastes ""healthy."" My husband loves these; I merely like them. :) Very low in sugar, which is great. I tend to mix them with other cereals.";positive
Good product but about the same price as the local grocery store.;positive
We like these.  A little pricey, but good.  We like a variety of sauces and this fits our needs.;positive
Extremely satisfied with Vedica Organics,  Great tasting and gives kind of a peace of mind knowing it is organic!;positive
Excellent tea- among the best I have ever had!;positive
I like adding it to iced tea to make a peachy tea. It is very good tasting as a flavoring, and I do not miss the all the sugar!;positive
Every one of the salts in this package are delicious. I particularly like the Hawaiian salt.;positive
I loved this rice, and it really is different that what you find in the store.  It really absorbs moisture.;positive
good, i won't get two pks next time..one is plenty for us..good quality though;positive
They are quite tasty and I would order them again.;positive
Excellent quality. Great for a Thai dessert, with the rice cooked in coconut milk & sweeter, topped with fresh mange slices, and slightly sweetened coconut cream on top.;positive
These are good hubby loves them but way too expensive!!;positive
Love the cinnamon. I am replacing all my current spices with Simply Organic Spices. They taste somewhat like fresh for me.;positive
Love these products and their Lentils are the best!;positive
Love the chocolate but of course everything is good in chocolate flavor!;positive
Love the taste of this water. So pure. Would recommend!;positive
they are what they are..  but we like them as a change from coffee tea and coco..;positive
OMG Incredible-Love this product-nothing better than lemony lemon made correctly-thank you so much!;positive
If you like the taste of Puff Rice cereal, this is for you! Mild, with and after-taste of puffed rice.;positive
Excellant product. I order it by the case. Taste just as good as reg pasta;positive
I will be ordering this again and again. Delicious freeze dried lemon. I use lemon on everything possible. Great for getting needed bioflavonoids.;positive
Bob's is a great company. Very ethical and earth conscious.;positive
Never thought food could get better!;positive
I use sweet dairy whey in baking and even in smoothies although it is not as high in protein as whey concentrate. Bob's Red Mill products are always good.;positive
Smells wonderful tastes good and has many uses both cosmetic and culinary.;positive
I am so happy I finally found a mayo that is healthy.;positive
Milkmaid tea works well...Don't like the pic on the label though.  I have 5 little boys, and I have to remove from box to use. :(;positive
"This item is worth the purchase.  Don't expect huge seed though.  While they are larger,  they are not ""jumbo"" size.";positive
These are my favorite Kind bars.  The salty and sweet combination is delicious!;positive
Excellent but almost double what I paid last year;positive
Most delicious honey and so good for your health as well.;positive
Cucumbers are great. These are not juicy though;positive
One of my favorite candies of all time. I could eat them till I get sick. I like the larger size, cheaper this way. Highly recommend.;positive
I bought this, but find that the tea isn't nearly as potent as other brands.  Takes a while to steep and does not seem to have the concentration required to benefit from the inherent properties of green tea.;positive
As good as cocoa powder is going to get in its pure form! I've been a long time fan of Pernigotti, but my local store quit carrying it, so I've made the switch.. This stuff is wonderful.;positive
Taste good like in the boba shops although you have to use more powder vs another brand i got.;positive
Lovely for coffee, & keto, will buy again.;positive
My son loves these worms! It makes a great gift for someone who is hard to buy for and enjoys gummies.;positive
Okay I suppose next time will pick up cream at market;positive
Love these bars! And they're gluten and dairy and soy free. That's a huge bonus. These are extremely filling though.;positive
the absolute BEST ginger candies I've ever had!!!;positive
This product is not hard and tastes wonderful!;positive
my favorite pure stevia powder I've tried, and price is best here that I've found : );positive
Low in calories and stops that sugar craving! Not just for kids whose moms want them to eat organic everything!;positive
I use Shirataki noodles all the time and find them very easy to prepare and blend in with any sauce I have used with them.;positive
Taste was good and fresh. Packaged well.;positive
Fresh and crispy,  with the natural flavor of grapefruit and completely calorie free beverage. It is ideal for thirst quenching, low calorie diet, and drinking something more than just plain water.;positive
This gum is very good. I will definitely purchase it again.;positive
Needs more watermelon flavor and less sweetner.;positive
"BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT AS THANK YOU FOR NURSING CARE
FACILITY,. DID NOT HEAR FROM THEM BUT KNOW IT WAS
APPRECIATED.";positive
One of my favorite seasonings and a staple in my kitchen. Can't go wrong with Lawry's!! Speedy delivery!;positive
The taste did not seem in any way artificial, but I do wish it was a bit stronger peach flavor.  Sweetness was good, and in use its flavor definitely enhances the natural peaches in the dishes I make.;positive
Glutino is my go to brand as a Celiac.  These crackers work for with most dishes and soups, I keep them on order!;positive
Excellent product! Came packaged super well. Beautifully packaged. Healthy grains. Clear instructions looking forward to great brews.;positive
Great way to get extra vitamins and greens into your smoothies!;positive
My Husband likes this flavor exclusively. I make the tea in 1 quart mason jars and the strength is perfect for 3 cups. It is no longer available in any of our local stores, we love Amazon for providing it.;positive
Good option for a low carb diet. I can use a little less than the recipe states as it has sweet taste.;positive
So Tasty, definitely curb the hunger pangs.;positive
"GREEEEEAAAAT new size, sure is good to at last have a size that you don't have to worry about running out of it!
[...]";positive
"These are heaven! Taste so sinful and delicious. How can they be gluten free and good for me?! I always have two of these bars on me at all time; good for breakfast, snacks, on the go.";positive
A bargain for institutional kitchens  and of course very good quality and taste;positive
Great, real maple syrup. Organic. Delivered to my door. Can't ask for more than that. Flavor beats any maple syrup I get at the market [...].;positive
If you've tried the drink in stores you'll be happy with this.  It's very good, very similar to the original.  5 calories per serving too.;positive
They're skittles...what not to like?;positive
YUMMY. Not as sweet as other brands. GREAT on WASA crackers, alone or with PA Cream Cheese or Yoghurt.;positive
Good tea, bought it because I heard it helps melt fat, not sure it works like that or maybe I gave up to soon;positive
Works well with any kind of fish. Simply add the powder and salt to your taste.;positive
great if you like coffee with a kick!;positive
My new favorite coconut product!  It's great for pies as well as in my coffee.;positive
Love this stuff!  I buy a bottle or two every month and I think it has definitely improved my sleep and I would say I slept pretty well before using this.;positive
this flavor is addicted, brown sugar and cinnamon. I put it on oatmeal and love it. I can't run out.;positive
Hot and spicy and chunky! It's a very delicious product that I will buy again for sure!;positive
I have searched for decaf that had deep flavor and great taste and this coffee is it.  I barely miss caffeine since brewing this and I'm glad I found it via Amazon.  You can't miss w/ this brand!;positive
taste good, but has a lot of sugar on the edges, will order again;positive
Simply The Best!  Unbelievably Excellent!  Heavenly!;positive
Very fresh. I use in my yogurt, oatmeal, and in some cookies I make. I store the extra in the freezer. When I get it out to use there is no problem.;positive
VERY smooth and not overpoweringly flavored, just right.  The aroma is intoxicating.  We'll be ordering, again, for sure.;positive
Delicious and reorder many times!  Use for my DeLongi small espresso  machine as well as my wonderful Hamilton Beach single cup coffee maker #850253501.;positive
This is the only coffee I drink. I have a subscription to have it automatically delivered every 6 weeks.;positive
Almost as good as the Raspberry Tea.;positive
Best crystallized ginger we have ever had.;positive
I love the taste of this coffee but it's not quite a fine enough grind for espresso.;positive
"They're Haribo gummy bears. What's not to love? Also, they're perfect for soaking in your spirit of choice ;)";positive
Kids love this with their cereal. Convenient Long shelf life and full of flavor. My daughter who cannot stand milk started eating cereal for breakfast.;positive
This is incredibly good almond butter. It is smooth. The individual packets are great for athletes. One problem, this stuff is incredibly expensive!;positive
Great value and great tasting.  Had to hide them from myself!;positive
Love these, too bad they are bad for you with all the sugar and all....;positive
great taste some of the best around!;positive
Always a favorite, but difficult to find in grocery stores.;positive

Love the tea  it really taste  Excellent Thank You  Mrs Cardine L Jordan;positive
A good paste.  Not too hot and adds good flavor.;positive
Interested in trying a different diet soda?  Give this a try then.  I think the cola flavor isn't great, but the cherry is decent.;positive
Our Uncle Lee's Organic green tea arrived on time and very well packaged.  Glad we chose this tea as we  now are enjoying the clean crisp flavor of the tea.  Tried another brand before and did not like it.;positive
This is such a great idea and works as advertised.;positive
You've heard it before, but here's one more vote: best almond flour I've tried!;positive

Bob's Red Mill organic buckwheat flour makes very good pancakes and other things . I mix it with almond flour and make cakes;positive

These are way too good. Something sinful to look forward to each day.;positive
Great for kids, taste kids love, easy to make.;positive

Nice flavor and nice price..You get a nice amount of pieces for the price..It tastes great and the flavor lasts  .;positive
good replacement to product no longer avalilble;positive
somehow I've eaten this nearly every day for the past few years. I love it and hope they never change it;positive

Love these- use in tea, oatmeal and baking. Great quality and flavor!!!;positive
I feel the greatest coffee made. Super taste and no after taste;positive
My husband carries this because not every place has Splenda.  It works very well.;positive
Great taste but hard and crunchy. Good for dunking in coffee or cocoa. Definitely a good go to snack easy to travel with!;positive
This is a wonderful item. I am very happy with the quality and service. I wish there were more recipes in my cookbook for this.;positive
Seriously - best little gift ever for the tea drinker!  I always wished my mugs had a lid so that my tea didn't get too cold while it was steeping... This little item is so great in the simplest way!;positive
Excellent.  Not as salty as others. No clumps.  Great taste and price.;positive
This is the best coffee I've every bought.  I like that the grounds settle on the bottom of the cup rather than floating around like Maxwell House;positive
These are delicious. Takes a while to make them since they are very thin.;positive
Al,out like sugar. Good stuff. No bitter after taste, no metallic flavor.;positive
This is a great product for scratch-made custard pudding.  Sure, it takes longer than instant, but it sets up perfectly and tastes great.;positive
Tasted just like the sauce we had in Peru.  VERY good!  You only need a little bit.  VERY hot spicy.;positive
"I found these to be a bit acidy for my taste.  Otherwise just fine.  The Lungo version was much better, not to mention you get more espresso.

It was smooth to the taste but as I mentioned a bit acidy.";positive
this brand will always be my favourite-smooth, mellow and satisfying-a really good DeCaf;positive
I'm a black coffee drinker, but once in a while I want cream and sugar with it.  That pretty much describes this K-cup.  Decent, pleasant taste in a convenient one-step process.;positive
A very economical protein source for vegans, good tasting and versatile.;positive
Love the Flavor and taste almost like my Mother just to make it;positive
contrary to some of the other reviews I have read, my coffee arrived in original Starbucks packaging thankfully. The taste and quality were great.  Pikes place is the best coffee out there in my opinion.;positive
"I liked these way more then I thought I would. There isn't much hamburger in it though.
You might have to experiment with the power level of your microwave. Mine causes it to boil over if I use full power.";positive
I have ordered every organic canned fruit from this company (except for mandarin oranges) and all but the pineapple are objectionable.  The pineapple has great consistency and taste. I can highly commend it.;positive

If you are an Earl Grey Connoisseur, this tea is for you! LOVE LOVE LOVE! Heave with bergamot.;positive

Not as crazy about the berry but I eat them all and appreciate them;positive
Always good for children who don't drink enough water.;positive
I use two table spoons in my coffee and I like it better than regular cane sugar.  The taste is a bit mild and not overly sweet.  It's also supposedly better for you.;positive
Great product, arrived promptly and without any problems.  Use it for my bread machine.;positive
Ive compared this to Lindt 85%. Ghirardelli 86% is slightly sweeter and less sticky. The Lindt has that peanut buttery texture the way it sticks to your palate while eating it. This doesn't do that as much.;positive
Excellent seller and product, thanks;positive
Love this stuff.  Price is high but it is worth it.  Very delicious tasting.;positive
Couldn't wait to try these! Perfect size for a perfect snack. Would recommend.;positive
This tea has a great taste. I will purchase again.;positive

Good variety good price good shipping happy with my purchase;positive
Love these and can no longer find them in my area. Thanks to Amazon for getting them to me!;positive
Really good nuts - always order this product;positive

Thank you. This product is excellent !;positive

Great for low carbers!!  Will be ordering again!;positive
Just as the title of my review says, it's my favorite tea of all times. Not to strong and not too sweet. Perfect hint of vanilla.;positive
I have tried many organic raw honeys that are much more expensive, but this one a the winner. Tastes great with cream like texture and health benefits.;positive
They came on time, they are fresh, salted and tasty;positive
Love it! It takes so good and its my go to jam for everything. I even use it for coating on my chocolate brownies and the price is VERY AFFORDABLE!;positive
Salted just right.  Slightly different taste I'm assuming from being dry roasted but still tastes good.;positive
I enjoy these chips and the price is great!;positive
Great seller- super good- super fresh!!;positive

Love love love the perfect combination of sweet, crunchy and salty.;positive
I like this spearmint gum. I am not really a gum chewer but I wanted something for after dinner instead of something sweet. I'm thinking of ordering some of the other flavors so I'll have some variety.;positive
not sugar free, came up on search as sugar free;positive
I'm not sure why it's so pricy but I can't find the linguini in my market. Dreamfields is always my go-to pasta. The seller is great!;positive
"I tried this coffee, continued trying others, but keep ending up coming back to the ""kick-ass dark"" roast.";positive
Very fragrant!  Planning to use this for canned pickles this Fall.  Good price for the quantity;positive
These are tasty little treats, as long as you don't mind a few chia seeds stuck in your teeth. The coconut is my favorite flavor!;positive
Good green tea, it's not sweet at all.;positive
This is my favorite of all the Indulgio Cappucino's. It's wonderful and I have at least one every day.;positive
Arrived quickly. I use it for cooking and making hair pomades.;positive
This coffee is very bold. I drank a lot of this same coffee from my electric drip coffee maker. I need to water these down a bit. No complaints, however. It just goes farther.;positive
Great snack!  Very flavorful and my children (18months, 4yo, & 6yo) LOVE them!  They were fresh and whole when arriving.  I would order these from Prime Pantry again!;positive
Great on nuts or anything needing a salt cling. But it doesn't stick to air popped popcorn.;positive
This is hubby's favorite mint.  I don't know how he can keep the mint in his mouth.  The flavor is S T R O N G!!  Too strong for me.  But he is very happy with these.;positive
Fast and great quality, great for parties.;positive
"Great product;  the nuts are fresh and delicious.";positive
Fresh, but quality raw cashews.  They are a bit stinking to me. Never noticed that about raw cashews before, but they taste great.  Healthy snack.;positive
"This product is a standby in my kitchen;  adds flavor to many different dishes.";positive
I'm still learning to make homemade corn tortillas, but what I have been able to make is pretty tasty!;positive
Love these shakers and apparently they are discontinued, so I will refill them.  I use as a cleaning product.;positive
We've tried our own spice blends and other brands but we keep coming back to Wick Fowler's.  It's expensive, compared to buying spices and mixing yourself, but we love this so much it's worth it.;positive
One of my favorite black petters. Has a little more bite than average.;positive
WOW what a mushroom it melts on my tong, I dream about mushroom, I live for the mushroom, I love my mushroom;positive
Sometimes cans come dented, but never had any that were burst;positive
i enjoy these Lentil Chip, they are nice and spicy.;positive
I plan on making these soon, I haven't had a chance to use them.. Plan to use them to sprout.. Sure they are of the same fine quality as the other products;positive
I highly recommend this cereal. It is why I bought so many boxes at once.  Not overpowering on the sugar yet sweet enough to make you want more.;positive
My daughter swears that a teaspoon of this will cure anything. A bit pricey but well worth the quality;positive
Bionaturae is the best.  You cannot tell that this is gluten-free.  Highly recommend.  Can also purchase at Whole Foods, about 4.00 a bag.;positive
If you crave something  crunchy,  maybe a little salty. How about with protein and fiber? Yes, it really tastes good. This particular one from Beanitos is my favorite.;positive
Delicious and I love that they are portioned out.  A bit healthier than chips.;positive
I will be ordering more of this.  How great is it to know that you are getting pure juice and no sugar and added chemicals.;positive
My only complaint is that most of it was dark roast;positive
Great price!  My husband loves this tea;positive
I really do like this cereal.  I noticed a sweet (strawberry ?) flavor without the fruit...even better is right A+.;positive
This is the best gluten free rye bread I have every tasted.;positive
Sure, this stuff is creepy, but it actually tastes decent.;positive
I mix this with my other teas, too and get the perfect flavor that's good for me !;positive
These are the first Chia seeds I have ever had so I might not count but I can say that these seeds were delivered fresh and I feel healthy just adding them to my green drink.;positive
Love cultured ghee and this ghee is the best I can find in the market. Really organic taste. Will buy more. Price should be little lower. Less than $15 would be best for this size.;positive
Great product, happy with everything I've received from Farm Fresh Nuts.;positive
I buy this about 4 times a year and it lasts a long time. Its great mixed with yogurt and adds a lot of protein that stays with you.;positive
i love these things, and they are vegan! just slightly spicy, enough to detour 2 out of 3 kids. obviously not healthy food, but cheap yummy vegan comfort food.;positive
This stuff is so incredibally delicious. I recommend it to everyone.;positive
"White pepper is a sneaky way to have pepper...So good; love it and it came on time...";positive
Loved it.  This is my favorite treat.;positive

Hi I am very happy with coming on time and is great taste absolute recommend  to every one to like to cook;positive
Great spice but lousy packaging.  A suitable shaker/dispenser etc. would be better suited.;positive
My family loves Crystal Light Lemonade, and this is by far the best price I've found for it.  Much cheaper than the supermarket!;positive
the spicy noodle along with the soup really warm me up in the winter. well I like any kind of instant noodle;positive
First time buyer...fantastic product...found at Costco way cheaper but have no regrets on purchase.....one packet goes a long way.;positive
Tastes great and far better deal than the grocery store;positive

Good soup for a cold day.  Easy to make and they store for a long time.;positive
High quality product at reasonable price.  Service was as promised.;positive
Different than i expected,but good anyway;positive
OMG.. I'm really addicted to this. Taste awesome.  A friend suggested to add creamed corned. ...I did and tasted pretty good..but I liked it without the creamed corn;positive
Wonderful breakfast food. Hearty, tasty, and easy to make. I highly recommend it.;positive
I enjoy this and so did my husband who LOVES his coffee. I was surprised to see him grab a cup on his own :) Very tasty.;positive
Its good, a bit bitter and a stronger tea taste but decent. I might buy again but it doesn't desolve very well in hot water..takes a lot of vigorious stiring.;positive
This is a good product for cooking, teeth & skin moisturizer.;positive
"I used this batter to make ""finnish pancakes"" and they were fluffly and tasty. great batter.";positive
Good value. Love the crunch that this product has. It is handy to keep when you want something sweet & crunchy.;positive

Delicious coffee, at only 35 cents a serving, is a steal.;positive
I love the way these taste but I found them cheaper elsewhere.;positive
Makes the kitchen smell homey in the morning.  A nice coffee.;positive
Good stuff. I Took them to work every day as a morning meal when i did not have time for breakfast. Only reason they did not get five stars is because I enjoyed other flavors better.;positive
tastes very good...nice mixture...easy to cook;positive
Great tasting, fresh and chewy. Not hard like other sellers.;positive
not sweet, but perfect coconut water!!;positive
Love Cafe Bustelo! This works perfectly in my Aeropress;positive
My husband loves these - memories of being a Golf Caddy in high school!;positive
The tastiest and healthiest choice!;positive

I think the white peppercorns add a sophisticated touch to most dishes that I use them for after grinding them in their own pepper grinder.;positive
Coconut and Chocolate! What better combination! Will definitely continue to purchase.;positive
One of my kids had celiac....so, I made this in my cast iron muffin tin and they're delicious. I think I'll add some vanilla next time. I'll definitely buy this again. LOVE Bob's Red Mill.;positive
Product arrived on time and as promised.  These sun dried tomatoes are yummy.;positive
It took about 3 cycles before the little guys woke up. However, they have already tripled in number. I am very happy I lucked out with this seller. And, my kefir tastes great! Thanks!;positive
Doctor said I had a protein deficiency, so recommended certain high protein foods.  A handful of these cashews before bed also helps with sleeplessness.  Good seller, arrived fast.;positive
There is nothing quite like Toblerone! MMMMMMM!;positive
Purchased for my son, he is the big walnut eater in our family,  They were shipped fast & were fresh!;positive

Good lawd, that's a whole lot of candy!;positive
Exactly as promised.  Full bag, whole hazelnuts, and ready for the baking.;positive
These are yummy. They are a bit harder (both chocolate and berry) than other chocolate covered blueberries I've had. They have a shimmery coating, so are extra fancy for gifts.;positive

These pumpkin seeds are excellent.  Taste good and easy to get a hand full on the go or when you just something to hold you over.;positive
Planning a recipe using this product.;positive
A little too sweet. Still its good to eat, just not too much.;positive
These have a great flavor and crunch but they do arrive with many broken pieces.  I kind of like that for everyday munching, but if you're using them for presentation, better to avoid the shipping .;positive
Ball always has a great product when pickling.;positive
"A little pricey...most of the juices tasted great. They arrived frozen.
I didn't get hungry at all and even lost a couple of pounds.";positive

We loved this product we put it in our smoothies.;positive
fast shipping, excellent quality, tastes delicious!;positive
These came well-packaged and were easy to cook.  They tasted okay, but not quite as good as the ones I get from Schwann's.;positive
this is my favorite flavor for this past winter. Hoping the continue to carry it;positive
"It is a ""fine"" almond flour! Both in texture and taste.";positive
This turkey bacon is the best I've come across (I feel I've tried them all).  Fry it in the pan and let cool on a paper towel to get that crispy texture (if you fry it long enough).  Flavor is delicious!;positive
Love  grade B maple syrup. This stands up to my expectations. highly recommend.;positive
Not a very strong chocolate taste but if you like flavored teas, these may be just the ticket for you.;positive

a lot of oats for an excellent price - organic too - will be set for oats for a long time - use them for oatmeal and in smoothies - great oatie taste;positive
This stuff is pretty much the bomb.  I'm too lazy to make it at home and I like the way this tastes compared to the Starbucks store version- not as 'acidy' if that makes sense.  It's super delicious over ice!;positive

I got this for a keto diet, but would eat it for breakfast any time. It's a bit pricey but there are a lot of servings, so it's not that expensive per serving.;positive
I like this tea because it has a nice subtle flavor without the bitterness that one often experiences with black teas.  And, I'm told that oolong tea is good for your health too, and that's why I tried it.;positive
Not as good as the ones from the Whole Foods deli area (which have added sunflower oil).  These are more like dry-roasted nuts.  Delicious... just not my preference.;positive
Taste very good. It is a little expensive, but I am buying it again.;positive
sheer perfection!  Wonderful mouth feel and a good kick!;positive
"Just as I remember from the '60's and '70's. Really good candy, except the black ones. I don't like the black ones.

LOVE my coconut oil. First time trying this brand but looks the same as the last one I ordered. THANKS! GOD Bless!;positive

Use this all the time because I know how long to cook it and it tastes good.;positive
It got here so fast!  I looked like a hero to everyone else.;positive
You can't stop eating these! Great flavor and heat at the end!;positive
If you enjoy sunflower seeds, you'll love these! They are so much tastier than the bags of white pumpkin seeds sold in stores.;positive
Great tasting and healthy for you :);positive
Decent quality stuff for coffee fans that don't want to put the time and effort into complex brewing. A little bit on the expensive side, but worth it for the reduction in time it takes to make it.;positive
Keystone canned beef is the best canned beef I have ever had. Full of rich flavor and no objectionable ingredients. The only way it could be better is if it was grassfed and in BPA-free cans.;positive
Tasty with the right amount of spice but too man calories;positive
Very nice taste, but very high in calories in my book. If that's not an issue for you, this is a good chocolate drink.;positive

Very good and great for popcorn and broccoli and cheese soup! Will order more and try other products from them!;positive
Taste great and I don't like oatmeal.;positive
use this to mix my energy powder. Tastes like it always has. Nice to know somethings don't change.;positive
I think it's lovely, lightly acidic, fresh.  It's not bitter at all.  My wife doesn't like it, because it's light and not bitter.  To each their own.;positive
I love these almonds, as they are so fresh and easy to chew.  I use almonds several times each week;positive
These are lovely on their own, or mixed with other colors. They are subtly sweet as well as peppery;positive
Love this gluten free pasta.  I use it in soups and for pasta salad.;positive
Nice variety of vinegars. Gives me a great sampling of future purchases.;positive
This product is very hard to find.  We ate the whole container in 24hours. Toffee nuts are like potatoe chips eat one and you can't stop. Will purchase again.;positive
OMG why did I buy these??? I adore them! I gained so much weight I can't order them again, can't trust myself when they're near me! But sooooo yummy! I'd prefer more twix in the mix but that's ok.;positive
I've used stevia for years and prefer the pure stevia (as opposed to the ones with erithrytol and such added).  This brand is excellent...the best I've used and without bitterness.  Fantastic!;positive
I like it them. I couldn't put them down. I don't eat fudge a lot maybe twice year, because it is so expensive. This was a a good price. 1lb for $15 and it had assorted which was good. I would recommend these;positive
Product was well sealed in a foil container, almost hard to open in fact!  It was from Frontier and a high quality organic product with a deep orange color indicating freshness.;positive
With a little added salt, it kind of tasted like taco meat. I liked the flavor a lot.;positive
Always great flavor.  Just be very mindful of the salt taste when making the broth.;positive
I loved that it was the right pink and was very fresh and tasty;positive
couldn't help but to be in awe and maybe an ew;positive

The teriyaki sauce is sweet, but not sickeningly so...I love turkey jerky and this is just chewy enough without ripping out your teeth.;positive
Love it.  Works well in my hair and as a body moisturizer.  It also leaves a wonderful smell on my skin.  If you love the smell of coconut, then this is for you. I can't see myself buying any other kind.;positive
Delicious product.  I sprayed it on bread , then buttered it before broiling.  Yum!;positive
Greenbow Organic Bee Pollen is a great product!  I incorporated Bee Pollen into my culinary experience recently and am glad I did.  This product is full of good stuff for the body!;positive
I love this stuff! It really does hold true to taste and I regularly cook with it. Thanks for an excellent product.;positive
My daughter likes the Gardetto's Original Recipe but wish they would come in the smaller snack size back.  We had to divide up the bag in sandwich bags for her to take to work.;positive
Extra colors that don't come with most sets plus all you would normally get;positive
There's just nothing to say.  They are too good for mere words on a computer screen.  I've had pop tarts in my life since I was a kid when they first came out, early 60's I believe.;positive
gave to a friend. like other flavors myself;positive
We like this brand. I'll continue to purchase more;positive
Yes this is a bright pale green color. Not quite the kelly green one is looking for in matcha, but it has the slightly sweet flavor one would like. This is a TINY amount.;positive

Delicious and healthy rice! Just do yourself a favor and give it a try.;positive
Yummy...Fast delivery considering it came from across the pond...;positive
The other reviewers are correct that it tastes similar to fruity pebbles. I didn't notice much difference between colors, though, which was a little disappointing. Still, they were tasty.;positive
Big Franks...Nice & meaty.  Can grind them up & make a nice base for meat-sauce (Broth & All!);positive

Torrani Pumpkin Pie Sauce!  I love the flavor of
my coffee with this in it.  It makes my coffee so

Perfect size to throw in your lunchbox;positive
Homemade caramel macchiatos. So much love for them. This is perfect caramel.;positive

One of a few energy drinks that I buy regularly. The sugar levels are just right and they taste much better if you leave them in the fridge after 2hrs. The price is a bit expensive.;positive
What can i say. Jif peanut butter has a good nutty flavor. Love the extra crunchy. Not overly sweet like some other peanut butters. When the price drops we stock up.;positive

Twinings has the best and only Earl Grey tea that I will drink. I didn't realize that the teabags are smaller then their 'regular' sized teabags when I bought this. Even then, it was still an OK price.;positive
Decaf tea doesnt seem to taste as good as regular but Im sensitive to caffein so its worth it.;positive
"lovely spicy flavor and smooth tasting tea.  I don't taste the ""earthy"" flavor that other reviewers have mentioned, but it is very lovely tea.";positive

Very, very tasty!! Does anyone know where my wife has hidden them?;positive
Lucuma powder is considered a superfood, and I wanted to try it. It has a delicious caramel-like flavor, and can be easily added to smoothies.;positive

If you are a trea drinker, go with this flavor and you will never look back.;positive
Great as ever. Amy's is always a winner. I like this over baked potatoes. My one compliant is dented cans in shipping. This might be one item you want to buy in the store.;positive
Nice to have  a gluten free shortcut for oatmeal. the apple cinnamon flavor is quite tasty, and it is all right in the texture category.;positive
No it's not restaurant quality, but it's perfectly adequate for a light winter lunch. Goes well with a couple microwaved frozen egg rolls.;positive
A favorite snack and so convenient to purchase in bulk.;positive
Tastes great. Little goes a loooooooooong way. It would be easy to overuse this, because it's really fine, and pours out fast. I think this one package will last me my lifetime.;positive
I love this large size. I keep one in the fridge at all times. It's what I drink when I'm really thirsty.;positive
I'm totally hooked on this chai tea!  I've tried others, but this is the one for me!  Funny, but the cups feel like there's nothing in them, but there sure is!  The best chai tea I have tasted for sure.;positive
This is the best seasoning i have found yet. Smokey flavor, lots of flavorful herbs... really done well. Will re-order.;positive
Good chocolate. You can actually taste the orange citrus flavor. It complements the chocolate and doesn't dominate the flavor.  Great treat.;positive
"Sooooo many recipes to add this to. Basic, is scrambled eggs with this added. Kids love it! Chop it up a bit more though; there's some pretty big pieces in the bag.";positive
Great product for our candy bar for a graduation party;positive

I'm a dark chocolate lover, usually go for 90 or 85% but this brand has the fiber content that I love. Smooth creamy taste, very happy;positive
Convenient way to get a single serving of salmon, great to take to work.  It has no seasoning so I always bring a little packet of Ms Dash or other seasoningings to mix in with it so it isn't so bland.;positive
The Granny Smith ones are by far the best, but at a close second, these are amazing. Great light crunchy snack! Pricey... But living over seas I can't complain!;positive
I bought this Syrup to add to mixed drinks and it has worked great. It adds real cherry flavor to any combination.;positive
Not arabaca beans but still good flavor;positive
Danish cookies were delicious, fresh and unbroken in all  four well sealed reusable tins. Shared one can with staff. Within a half hour they were all gone, asking for more and where I got them.;positive

I like this & the fact that there is no MSG is such a huge thing for many!;positive

"I just opened the box; these candies are soo good.  They came fresh and well-packaged.  Highly recommended.";positive

When you are on a low carb diet and need something crunchy or to dip into your egg salad.. these are perfect.;positive

These were so good! It was hard to not eat the entire bag at one time. They may be a little too good!;positive

Wonderful and refreshing beverage. Best price Ive found online.;positive
We like some flavors of Balance Bars, but Peanut Butter isn't at the top of the list.  The child loves them, though, and they make a handy breakfast when everyone's feeling lazy.;positive
Awesome taste. One of the best licorices I have ever eaten... but I won't be eating too much more at this price. This is an occasional treat. Too expensive for anything else. But boy oh boy is it good!;positive

For being no sugar this is not bad at all;positive
I'm a customer who will continue to purchase...Love Big Train;positive

Tastes like their dark chocolate. Is the right amount of thickness, even when half gone it only takes turning upside down and a few gentle shakes over about 6 seconds before it starts coming out.;positive
It's hard to write a review for gum. I bought this to help fight (and heal) existing cavities that I have. It's just a tasty gum with great benefits. Hope it helps me!;positive

If you love peanut butter and looking for a great subsitute this is it.  It is also a great way to lower calories this it the stuff.;positive

I really really like this but it is outrageously expensive - a luxury.;positive
Very good if you like strong, Starbuck-like coffee.;positive
BEST espresso beans in the world, par none!  Good price here via Amazon!;positive

Hooked on Kona, and this is 5 lbs. It always is fresh when it arrives. Auto shipped and that saves you $$ Thanks Coffee Direct;positive

Its lime juice. It tastes like lime juice. The price was right.;positive

Nice mix of sweetness and tart. Keep a jar filled at office and home. Kids really enjoy as well as adults.;positive
Excellent yakisoba....just a little pricey. Comparable to UFO noodles. Only difference is this is not illegal to import to US.;positive

If you enjoy cherry flavor then this coffee is for you.  Wish it were more universally available.;positive
Very good - dried, but not leathery.  Tangy (I prefer the California apricots), but not sour.  Great product.;positive

This product has an amazing taste and the ingredients are so healthy but it's just so expensive for such a small amount of product.;positive
I have tried the Nicks Sticks Plain, but prefer the Spicy version MUCH better. They are NOT greasy and don't have foreign stuff in them. Once you try these you'll NEVER go back to the original Turkey Jerky.;positive
The very best candy bar that I have ever eaten! Absolutely delicious?;positive
Good for a quick breakfast when paired with yogurt  Also makes a nice snack.;positive
great coffee, I like it as well as starbucks and it costs less.;positive

Good but not great. The flavor was kind of bland. Would not buy again.;positive

The arrived when promised and I really enjoy them.;positive

This is a nice blend and works well for baking and thickening sauces.;positive
Wow this is the best zebra chocolate popcorn I've ever had.  However the one bad thing is that is disappears in an instant in my house.  Yummy.;positive
But I do like this tea and I feel like when I do drink it helps me. Not sure if it really does but I like to think it boosts my immune system and wards of colds.;positive
I don't know that it's made me lose weight but it's decent tasting tea and is a nice switch up from my other green and black teas I drink daily. Check it out;positive

This vanilla is one of the best for any cooking.;positive
Really Good !!! :D  When it goes on sale for $3.99, definitely try it :);positive

Fragrant mix for tomato based sauces. Large package size suits our needs.;positive
love cheez-its - is there anyone who doesn't?!?;positive
It's great on my popcorn but unfortunately it doesn't stick well. It has nice cheesy taste. Not sure what else I can use it for.;positive
My wife cut out dairy and gluten over the summer. Lo and behold, she in fact has reactions to both.  Rather than buying from the store EVERY WEEK, I can buy it from Amazon in bulk and save some money to boot.;positive
My family is very health conscious and we like our first taste of the fluffy quinoa.  We are substituting quinoa with rice as a staple food now.;positive
I love this cup I use it daily, the tea strainer is easy to clean and the cup is a good size and sturdy. The teas are very good too, the coconut flavor isn't super strong, but good all the same.;positive
Goji berries are an acquired taste but I like them!;positive
Cant live without this for my iced coffees and my low carb living. Only one carb per pump (purchased separately,also recommended).I go through a four pack quickly because it is that good!;positive
My husband really likes this gum and he's happy to be no longer chewing gum that has artificial stuff that's is not good for his brain, plus the xylitol keeps your mouth moist too. Very good product;positive

The coffee is GREAT.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it is so expensive that I can only have it for a treat now and then.  But the coffee is delish :);positive
this is a good product, a little on the salty side however it is fast to make and it does not taste like a box;positive
This oatmeal is amazing!  I put a scoop of whey protein in my bowl every morning and it's a great pre-workout meal!  Highly recommended!;positive

Good flavor. I used with my Soda Stream to make soda. That said, I find some other syrups are a better value.;positive

Great product! Bought this for my aunt to drink after major surgery and she really enjoyed it.;positive
family move night !! almost every one pops very little wasted and fun to make;positive

Needs a little more cheese taste, good for a snack on the run, kids love them. Need more flavors.;positive

All I have to say is.....pure addiction!!!!!;positive

"What can you say about Chia seeds besides Chia-Chia .... ... another great product supplied by Bob;'s Red Mill";positive
THE VERY BEST HOT CHOCOLATE ON THE MARKET!  We don't do dairy.  No dairy in this.  I don't even really love hot chocolate because it's just too creamy and sweet.  This is dark, rich....  perfect!;positive

The bars are a bit on the small side, but my gluten-free son likes them pretty well.;positive
good, but not great.  the other brand i usually get was out of stock so i got this instead.;positive
I love this and I hate coconut.  I eat a tablespoon of this oil every day.  It tastes mildly of coconut but I don't mind it at all. I also use it as a hair mask.  Great vale too.;positive
These are delicious! The mint flavor is subtler than you get with most after-dinner mints, and they're a bit larger than the ones I've seen in the past. They're very airy, and crunchy but easy to chew.;positive
Kids loved this they couldn't get enough of this hearty peanut butter;positive
Smooth strong coffee. In the ilk of Deathwish, Revv, and Jetfuel. Not better, but it can run with the pack neck in neck.;positive

i like the taste of these bars and the fact they are gluten free and low sugar.  i purchased these bars as they have the most protein so make for a great pick me up snack....;positive
I love Conch and these small bodied nuggets were great for many uses.......;positive
Loved these chocolates from first moment I tasted them. Prices vary greatly in stores and some are a true rip off. This is good value for price, fresh and delicious.;positive
Only downside is they need to be cut cause they are super long right out of the bag.;positive
Really like that fact that I can use these to make rice crispy treats. My husband has celiac disease and he likes he can have a bowl of cereal and bananas.;positive
"The best
  I eat twice a day with dice Apples, do come Ed strawberries and blueberries.  I use half milk and half water.  This is for a 1/4 cup oats and milk/water.  Then ""nuke"" for 2.5 minutes...";positive
"Not as big as the competition but they taste really good; nice and crunchy. You can make so delicious tacos at home.";positive

This is my second time purchasing this bag of pepper corns. It is a first class product at a good price. I expect to purchase it again too.;positive

okay....but they are too sweet for my taste;positive
Good price for an excellent soy sauce.;positive
Ordered these for a recipe, came quickly.  I haven't used them yet but they appear as pictured.  They are very small, but that is exactly what I needed.;positive
I always order my vanilla extract from Amazon. I cannot get a better price, thank you!;positive
So good!  I use these in my stir fry's and they are so yummy!;positive
I love sorghum flour.  It's mild in flavor and smell, it's easily mixed into flour blends for gluten free baking too.  It's one of my favorites along with millet, sweet rice, coconut and almond.;positive
Lots of good flavors Cake Boss were the best;positive
These are really really really good sardines. Many times the sardines are only 3 to a can because they are so big and fat. The lemon juice is not overpowering - great with just about any red wine!;positive
Great quality for a great price.  My only complaint is the bag isn't resealable.;positive
Love the taste and I fine it better than anything I have in water bottles. Through the price is more than what I would paid.;positive

Very tasty. Nice presentation.  Very satisfied.;positive
I like this product...has a very nice flavor!;positive
I'm grateful for the item . This is a special Chinese peppercorn so be cautious. It gives a numbing sensation to the mouth which is authentic in such dishes as Ma Pa Tofu but it's a bit of getting used to.;positive
It's not my favorite, but there is certainly nothing wrong with it. I prefer it on pork and chicken rather than steak. My husband likes it. I simply prefer something with more spice.;positive
Love these perfect for a quick treat would recommend;positive
This is a great find so I got rid of Karo syrup. Much more flavor and my hot fudge sauce (ala Ample Hills Creamery recipe book) has the perfect texture.;positive
Simply the best. Olive oil from other countries isn't regulated and usually mixed with other oil. Buy this, be healthy.;positive
These are wonderful...right out of the bag!;positive
Lipton classic is THE only tea I drink, and the convenience of the kcupLove itt;positive
This is by far my favorite tea - I can't keep it in my house long enough without having to order more right away.;positive
Fresh, chewy, sour, tastes just like original sour patch, just larger.  Individual wrapping is great for sharing and portion control.;positive
Delicious with a faint taste of coconut.;positive
Good soup. It may be slightly over priced but I would but it again.;positive
Delish.  There is a slight discomfort to the tongue if you eat too many, but any salty product will do that.;positive
I use this in shakes and skinny chocolate. Yum. Good brand, wish it was cheaper.;positive
Great buy. Thinly shredded and delicious.;positive
What can you say bad about candy?....Its Fattening...;positive
"I used them all in one dessert; Tiramisu of course; The cookies were very fresh and packed perfectly as I didn't have one cookie that was broken.";positive
I didn't give it five stars because the chips are a little too sweet.  Next time I am getting the unsweetened chips.  I would recommend them to everyone though.;positive

SOOO MUCH BETTER THAN THE BROWN LUNCH BAGS I HAVE BEEN WASTING MONEY ON. THESE ARE THICK AND EASY TO OPEN. DON'T STICK AND TEAR LIKE THEIR CHEAPER BROWN COUNTER PARTS.;positive
Short of making your own, this is one of the best commercially available options.  The green is particularly well balanced.;positive
Pleasant tea, does not make me one bit sleepy.  Kind of stinky because of the Valerian, but that does not come through in the brewed tea.  Nice mostly minty tea in a cute can.;positive
Solid performer, this type of flavor is my favorite. This type of product and it's different flavors is a welcome topping for my popcorn;positive

"Im trying my hand at making teas. I couldn't get over how much i got in this packet. So, this will last me awhile!
good deal!!";positive
use this all the time  it is great with spices and a bit of olive oil and some wine for added flavoring...mixes easily without clumps;positive
Honestly I cannot see any difference between this and the kind sold at grocery stores and even at $ (dollar) stores.;positive
My daughter and husband love these gummies.  He says they are the best tasting ones he has ever had.  I wish they were different flavored packs though.  50 of all the same get a little boring;positive
Just fine. I really like this drink. I thought I was saving money but oops my bad. They are 2.99 a bottle in the store so I think I spent more buying in bulk. Ugh!! Good low cal drink though;positive
If you want a treat get this coffee.;positive
Very good for smoothies, needs an acquired taste but not bad. Very healthy;positive
Amazon Fresh bananas are perfect and reasonably priced. I like the flavor of organic bananas and love that they are delivered to my door.;positive

Love this flaxseed oil.  I put it on my salad everyday and it doesn't have any bitter taste.;positive
Yummy Sweet Potato fries... better than from a restaurant!;positive
We love that we can just cap the tube and not spoil the rest of the tomato paste.  We hated the cans of opened paste we had to throw out.  It's a little pricey.  Hope it gets cheaper.;positive
As advertised. Very nice spice mix.;positive
Use trivia all the time-no  aftertaste;positive
Yummy.  Love this very delicious tasting and smelling coffee.;positive
Simply the best Cocoa Powder.  There is such a difference in the final product when using quality ingredients.;positive

It's a good mix, there is a lot of sunflower seeds but, it worked well in some healthy cookie I made.;positive
OK, but I like a boldr, stronger coffee. The other pods are much better.;positive
I bought this product for use during my Whole30.  Don't be fooled, it may be a sub for soy sauce, but it tastes quite different.  Think soy sauce meets teriyaki sauce.  It's quite delicious!;positive

This is the closest thing to the no longer sold Starbucks lattes for Tassimo.  By far the best option available right now.;positive

This is a delicious mix with just the right amount of heat.;positive
I finally found this item that is not readily available in Florida. Adds a special touch to our Easter wheat pie.;positive

My parents love this syrup. They put in almost everything and is great at adding flavor without calories;positive
Fresh, nutty, sweet, crunchy, not too salty - what more could you ask for? Great on salads. Add them to ice cream. Add some to a protein drink. Eat them alone. Very addictive. Better buy two bags.;positive
You absolutely can not beat this price.  I use it for red velvet cakes and it has lasted me forever.  If you purchase in the grocery store it's too expensive.  I will always order this product online.;positive
Very tasty, I expected pieces to be larger.;positive

Dave's is the best, hearty, healthy, and delicious for any type of sandwich. Organic to boot.;positive

Small box but good product.  Thank you for providing online!";positive

This is a good product along with the stevia chocolate powder.  It's so good in coffee.  I feel like I am treating myself to a nice mocha coffee whenever I use this product.;positive
This drink mix has the true taste of the flavors it is based on. All flavors I've tried with this company have been true to their description. Highly recommend!;positive

I put this on fish such as trout, and everyone loves it!;positive
this is a GREAT SNACK. so healthy and enjoyable.  This is the snack i grab after I do my boot camp workouts.;positive
Good coffee, fairly strong flavor.  Great way to try a new brand.;positive
If you're looking for crisp, this isn't it. These are the consistency of raisins. If that's what you want, this is the product for you. The apples are good.;positive

These don't last long! People love them.;positive

Great box and loved the  choices to pick from..;positive
I like this tea for soups or to mix with ginger tea - but is very mild and I like strong tea. Recommend if you like your tea mild;positive
Clearly the best of the best.  If your body is worth the best, then this is it for a USA brand.;positive

Product was fresh, tasty and in a sealable bag.  Happy with this purchase.;positive
Super flavor & texture.  Used for mini-tarts and a lovely simple lemon mousse (curd folded into cool whip).  Recommend;positive

Best sushi rice I have ever found! Closest to restaurant quality I've ever had! Highly recommend!;positive

Great value!  I re-ordered this product again.;positive

Like it but the pudding separates after only 1 or 2 days;positive
This, without a doubt, is the best decaf coffee I have ever purchased. It is bold and rich. It arrived quickly and well packaged.;positive
No surprises here, a 15lb bag of Xylitol, is a 15lb bag of Xylitol. The fact that the bag was resealable was nice too.;positive

Jif peanut powder works well in smoothies and recipes that use peanut butter.;positive

Like the smaller size than the one I had purchased at locat store. It is a must to have in my household;positive

Pretty tasty once I figured out how to open them without tools. I don't know what else to say about honey.;positive
I love anything ginger! I didn't even know this product existed, until I saw it on Amazon! It is wonderful, by itself, or as a mixer. Wish it was more widely available, and for a lower price!;positive
OVERPRICED BEYOND BELIEF.  VERY GOOD THOUGH.;positive
Bought this from the health-food grocery, then ordered it on amazon.com to save a lot of money. Excellent flavor and fragrance -- more hibiscus than rose, but still delicious.;positive

Tasty and 70 calories a stick. I don't eat a lot of jerky but it's perfect for hiking with a group.;positive
I make pancakes from it on Sundays and they come out good.;positive

It's pretty much lemon pie filling, but good on toast.;positive

Best darn kraut I have ever had,  even beats homemade..  I want more...;positive

These are fantastic to use as sweeteners for coffee and tea. One stick is perfect (for me) to sweeten one cup of coffee or tea.;positive
Werent as good as you'd expect. They're just oreo-esque klondike bar. The outside ring of ice cream has the cookies crushed up but the inside (the majority of the ice cream) is plain vanilla.;positive
I love this tea but it is not sold in regular grocery stores.  Specialty shops charge a fortune, but this was a bargain!;positive
See comments I made regarding the Hotel Coffee-- fabulous!!;positive
Good flavor and strong. Bags are not individually wrapped, and need to be kept in air tight container, for damp climate.;positive
Just like sugar but safe for diabetics or those with cancer. Love it in my tea.;positive
Coffee is better with a bit of Half & Half...;positive
Fabulous Coffee. I am a coffee snob. This is really as good as the other reviewers noted. Try It- you will feel the same.;positive

Delicious syrup with a unique flavor. Remembering some ore's over the campfire when mixed chocolate flavoring in lattes.;positive
This was a really great idea! I love these coffees...I really enjoy looking through the different flavors, and getting a sample of different coffees.;positive
The size is just right and it still had the crunch when the cookies came out of the oven. I tried the store brands and the were to small. This is just perfect.;positive
As a coffeeholic its one my favorite K-cup coffees period. Green Mountain knows how to satisfy a coffeeholic, great aroma, great taste, satisfaction in every cup. Love these.;positive
Bought these for my son and he loves Dr Mercola anything;positive
I eat gluten free and these rolls are wonderful. I make them into sandwich buns. They are sooo good. They do call for cheese, but I have made them without the cheese and they are still very yummy!;positive
Good tasting gluten free product.  My granddaughter (who has celiac disease) likes the vanilla, and my grandson likes that chocolate.  He can eat gluten and he still likes these cookies!;positive

Gloria Jean's Great product, the only coffee my wife will drink;positive

Good coffee, strong flavor without bitterness.;positive
I am learning to love Green Tea and Might Leaf is one of my favorites.  Very smooth and taste good hot or cold.;positive
I love these things! The center isn't chalky or some other disgusting imitation. The cheaper brands just can't compare, at all.;positive
Nice price for a large jug of peanuts, Arrived quickly.;positive
For the price, this one has it.  I've been drinking this for a long time and the only one I see coming close on the vanilla is the Coffeemasters brand.;positive
Good strong coffee.  Price point a bit high compared to other dark coffee offerings.;positive
Purchased for my husband, he thinks it tastes wonderful and I have a hard time keeping it in stock. He drinks it cold, as a frappuccino instead of a cappuccino and it works well for that.;positive
"Really wanted a caramel, but this is a great substitute; easy to use, and lasts a long time! Flavor blends perfectly with my SF powdered Vanilla Caramel Coffeemate";positive
my husband uses this, he really liked the size and price. would buy again. makes his coffee good in am;positive

A small handful suffices -- they are also great paired with dates.";positive

This worked very well in an herbal tincture I made. The combo of herb,glycerin,temperature,and time produced a great flavored infused product. Try it as you will not be disappointed !;positive
Easy to measure, easy to combine with other flours, and I really appreciate that Bob's Red Mill products are whole grain and nutritious.;positive
So tastey. Great for anytime of day or making kombucha. Love these guys;positive

The item arrived on time. It works great. I would Recommended. Thanks Again.;positive

Fresh and crunchy. Just the right combo of butter and salt and sugar. Addictive.;positive
Gatorade quenchers - for the right price - they make a nice refreshing drink;positive
So nice to not run out of sanding sugars when decorating large batches of cookies, cupcakes and other baked goods. The large bags are more economical and convenient not to run out during a decorating session.;positive

Just got it . Smells and taste great;positive

I have to slow myself down from eating too many of these, they are yummy!;positive
THIS TEA IS DELICIOUS AND RELAXING. I HAVE GIVEN SO MUCH OF THIS TO OTHER PEOPLE TO TRY AND USUALLY GET GOOD FEEDBACK FROM THEM TOO.;positive
Love the taste of these mints from a great company;positive
Awesome, use it every day for many years;positive
Great oatmeal! I love this stuff and keep ordering it since my local store stopped carrying it.;positive
Awesome value and great for you. You'll need a big ziplock bag as the packaging is weak, but delicious raw almonds. Will buy again!;positive
My kids love these. Too bad Annies sold out to Monsanto. BOOOO!!! Now our healthy line of foods will no longer  be healthy. Contaminated by the many things Monsanto uses to poison us.;positive
My kids love having a nice warm cup of hot chocolate on the way to school in the morning. Very convenient;positive
I never thought I'd be a fan of dates, but after using them in brownies they are delicious. This bag contains quite a few so it lasts a while and they are gorgeous looking.;positive
Great product!  Will be ordering again soon!  Have already used about 1/3 or these great seeds for chia pudding.  Thanks!;positive
Love this. Hope to find a store for this the $27 and $42 deals are not for me.;positive
Very pure product but a little pricey.;positive
So yummy!  I am glad this item is at a great price, and ships so quickly.;positive
This is certainly one of the best microwave popped corns  that I have had ever had! It is absolutely delicious!;positive
This gum is great!  All the flavors are good, but cinnamon is my family's favorite.  Our dentist said this product is good for our teeth.;positive
I purchased these for a long trip and they really came in handy. They are the perfect size to throw into your bag. I've tried multiple brands of almond butter, and this brand was good overall.;positive
A healthy snack- my 2 year old and 8 year old both love the taste and I like that they are a reasonably healthy cracker.  Recommended for young families (although the adults in our house like them too!);positive
I prefer no cooking while camping. These are great. Never know what goodies you'll find inside.;positive
There's really not much to say here.  It's salt, a necessary kitchen staple.  You should probably get some.;positive
Arrived promptly.  So glad to be able to order it from Amazon since I cannot get it locally.  Good stuff!;positive
There's not much to this aside from the fact that the taste is really good and it has electrolytes. The downside to all Gatorade is that it has sugar so it's not good to eat at night;positive
Great popcorn, fluffier than any store bought corn. Healthier too.;positive
Not as good as Trader Joes but I still love these. Not spicy, but flavorful;positive
Cured my MRSA when nothing else would;positive
i made this kind for first time,i substituted,the water for whipping cream,wow moist flavorerful,scones was the result,not greasy or hard in the least,the cranberries in mix were tender,very good,;positive
Superbly fresh, tasty, crunchy, and a relatively excellent 2 lb price. Recommended.;positive
The first flavored water that I actually really like. And its all natural so even better.;positive
THIS IS VERY EXCLENT DECAF! I HAVE TRIED ALOT, FOR THE PRICE THIS IS THE BEST, AND IT TASTE LIKE REAL COFFEE.;positive
This is the best tasting rice I have ever eaten. Will buy again and again.;positive
Dark but not bitter makes a full 10 oz, I use the Hamilton Beach k cup maker great coffee;positive
Tasty and fresh. Glad I bought them.;positive
Great coffee if you want mild non acidic coffee;positive
This spice mix flavours my dishes beautifully. Pricey, but worth it.;positive
Essentially a fine mix of salt and sugar. I'm still learning how to cold smoke, but in the future I think I will probable use a 1:3 part ratio of tender quick to sugar to prevent an overly salty outcome.;positive
Very happy with the macadamia nuts - they WERE yummy!;positive
My lifetime favorite every month without a trip to the store.;positive
Better than I expected from a pod...  I'll order again.;positive
very good - hit the spot when looking for something sweet while watching calories.;positive
Great taste. Just wish the crust didn't burn so fast before the rest of the pie is done. It says you can place foil around the crust to keep it from burning but it still burns faster than the rest of the pie;positive
These worked superb in my wife's Green Bean Casserole this year!  They are also good enough to eat all by themselves.  :);positive
I love these nuts.  I've gotten them rather regularly.  My mother even started getting them.  great quality for a good price.;positive
The 3 pack is definitely a value. I'm a huge Christmas nerd so I'm excited to have these.;positive
I use Truvia in my coffee, smoothies, fruit & cereal.  I'm happy to order in in bulk like this....I don't have to run to the store as often.  I hope to order again!;positive
What can I say. If you love chocolate and hazelnuts this is the treat for you.;positive
This is really good tea. I was looking for something close to what I get when I go to a Chinese restaurant and this is pretty close. It's a flavorful and smooth blend. I will definitely reorder when I'm out.;positive
Blue Apron uses this - and it's GREAT!;positive
These came as described. I will order again. These are dried blueberries and taste good with no after taste. Good;positive
Good taste, packaged well, did not leak, good value.;positive
My husband has to start every day with one of the flavors of Grove Square Cappucino.  This is an excellent product and an extremely delicious decaf.;positive
Works great i feel tranquil just sniffing it.;positive
Got it Like always it is great !  KE;positive
What wonderful mild yet full-bodied tea.  Love, love this tea!;positive
It's simple and great for great tea instead of Lipton tea bags.willvorder again and subscribe monthly along with the Earl gray;positive
These Are Delicious -- Great Texture -- Well Smoked -- Try Em;positive
Yummy yum yum...a must have for anyone trying to live a more healthier lifestyle!;positive

Good bargain even though a little expensive.  Vacuumed packed...great flavor.;positive
this is a great product hard to find in stories;positive
This is my second bag of caramels...They are to die for!!!! I have to limit myself or I'll eat the whole bag in one sitting!!!!!;positive
Low calories and great flavor. I love the texture;positive
delicious and for a great price! the best in-price store I have ever seen was $19/lb. Even little children love these.;positive
I am iffy about beef so I worried.  It is great!;positive
2nd purchase and it is a great product with an even better price. I use it to cure pork bellies for homemade bacn and it works very well.;positive
Very good quality product.  I like the fact that it has no caffeine and is lower in carbs and fat than regular chocolate.  Only complaint is the price 8s a little higher than other dealers.;positive
Great Vegan and Gluten free Carmel corn!;positive
My husband and I love peanut butter, and this candy is good to eat for a snack that isn't expensive.;positive
I am so beyond addicted to this product I just wish it was cheaper  :,(;positive
Wonderful tasting, healthy seed butter! Spreads easily, and does not cause intestinal yeast.;positive
I have various food allergies and can't use the other types of energy replacements for running long distances.  This product is a natural alternative to provide energy without the impact of preservatives.;positive
good for you, i love to use when making smoothies;positive
A GO-TO everyone should get into for bedtime elixir with ginger, honey, and coconut. AND, of course, a dash of pepper. (turmeric needs pepper to act as a catalyst so it can do you its best good);positive
These are awesome and taste amazing!;positive
Will definitely order more once these are gone. So love the fact that these almonds are really raw (no pasteurization).;positive
Old favorite tea, I use it in my Kureg machine, a lot cheaper then k cups.;positive
Delicious! Will buy more when I finish it.;positive
There's Mac & Cheese... and then there's Kraft Mac & Cheese. And THEN... there's Kraft TRIPLE Mac & Cheese. Absolutely love these and enjoy ordering them with our new Dash button in the pantry.;positive
hubby says, what's not to like? They're great;positive
Never have enough Sparklely anything!;positive
Good bussiness n nice products. Not so good abt protection,maybe because of amazon prime not wrap it good.;positive
Old Wisconsin Cheese, Beef Stick and Cheddar, 1-ounce (pack of 18).  The beef stick is very tasty and the cheese is very good.  I will be reorders this again;positive

one of the best teas in the world!!! Love the blended flavors, just a little spicy which i love.;positive
Taste great. And great because you get protein to off set the carb intake!;positive
"I tried the Bigelow green tea first and wasn't too impressed. The Twinings Green Tea
had a better flavor and was not bitter";positive
My co-workers enjoyed most of what was in this variety pack;positive
Not quite as good as Illy, but a lot cheaper.;positive
"Hands down the best pudding in a box, jello does not know pudding.
The pudding has a real chocolatety flavor.";positive
Great price, works so well with my Keto cooking.;positive
Keeps my mouth busy.  Too bad it's not long lasting.  But which gum is?;positive
Flavacol is a great product, but use it sparingly. A little goes a long way. We mix it with the oil and popcorn in our hot oil popper.;positive
THIS IS A HEALTHY CEREAL AND THE CHOCOLATE MAKE IT EVEN BETTER.  MY FAMILY LOVES CHEERIOS AND THE BEST ONE TO THEM IS CHOCOLATE.;positive
"Dark, strong, concentrated, full-flavored. NOT BURNT!
Really great all-around coffee. Highly recommended. Great by itself, or flavored however you like it; makes a nice dark strong coffee!";positive
Just what I needed for my poppyseed roll.;positive
It's parmesan cheese - just exactly what you correct, and no different from what you'd find at a normal grocery store.  It's a good, large size, (I was buying bulk for an extended camping trip).;positive
This is the best deal around for coffee.  The flavor is smooth, deep and full bodied.  Hightly recommended.;positive
It's poll caught, that's interesting. The bones may only be in this batch. I'd still buy it again. BPA free canned fish is hard to find. DD;positive
These are a memory from my childhood and they are just like I remember them. They were cool, tasty, not to sweet.  Looking forward to more!!;positive
I like rhubarb and this is pretty good. Not as good as the Sour Cherry & Rhubarb.;positive
These are my wife's favourite chocolate.  Arrived as promised and most of them already eaten.;positive

Great crunch, not too sweet and the flavor from the dates is not overwhelming, nor is the coconut - just right!";positive
I've been drinking this stuff as long as I can remember.  Take my medicine with it.  It is thick and helps the pills go down;positive
This is the only brand of vchai tea I drink.  I have been drinking it for years and absolutely love it.  Highly recommend..;positive
Very soft beans, but flavorful. Made great vanilla when infused in vodka. Also works well to make vanilla pudding and to flavor other delicate foods like ice cream.;positive
Just what I wanted. Drinking it hot and cold and using it to make ice cream!;positive
Doing great. Came packaged well. Shed a few leaves adapting to new environment.;positive
these almonds are more like sweet and crunchy desserts;positive

We love Peet's Coffee.  This is a very nice smooth blend;positive
"Quick delivery, product matches description and ease of order.
I definitely recommend to my family and friends.";positive

These beef sticks are very good and the perfect size to fit in my purse or briefcase.;positive
great texture, great taste. a classic for a reason.;positive
My new fav sweetener!  Using for a low car diet.  In some recipes....erythritol gives a little cooling effect......so its trial and error. Bu tthis brand seems like good quality.;positive

love the flavor and aroma of this coffee;positive
The batch I got were good, but many segments were broken into smaller pieces.  Still, not bad for fifty cents a can.  Packed in light syrup in can that requires can opener to open.  Good flavor.;positive
I purchased these as a gift for a fellow coffee lover and she says she's really enjoying them! Variety packs are always fun to try :);positive
Wonderful peppercorns. Buy all my spices from simply organic now.;positive
These healthy bars taste great. My children ages 5 and 7 also love these bars.  We buy them often and the quality ingredients are worth the price.;positive
My son loves these snacks, and he is hard to please. They are small, which is perfect for throwing in your purse for those just in case moments.;positive
"I eat frequently as a dry snack.  I also use to ""beef"" up the ramen noodles I eat on occasion.  About a quarter cup added gives a little extra punch.  Add some dried ""Just Peas"" and it's almost a banquet!";positive
Great for grilling steaks. I use it all the time with a little olive oil for searing;positive
Been using for our Hot Chocolate since the early 1990's. Now that the kids are grown-up they use for their families.;positive
"Taste good, a bit on the pricey side. but I like it much better than  Blue Agave Nectar that I bought prior.
if price was lower I would buy again.";positive

These are great. They are a kind of fluffy peanut butter so good. We all love them at my house. This is a pretty good price.;positive
This is the best granola I have tried and it isn't always easy to find in the grocery store.  It goes great with yogurt and is a healthy way to start the day.;positive

I like the taste and it uplifts my recipes.;positive
Like the vanilla latte the best but this is good;positive

We have been using Tim Hortons for about a year now, We enjoy our morning coffee and tim hortons hits the spot !!!  :);positive
"Yup, tastes like freeze dried fruit.  Great for adding in to chocolates, though I may stick to dehydrated fruit in the future.

The price was about the same as grocery store prices.";positive
These are delicious. I sometimes need a little something between meals due to diabetes, and these are the perfect snack without being too high in carbs. Delicious!;positive
This stuff is awesome tastes just like real peanut butter! It's nice to add flavor to smoothies too!;positive
Very good!  I am loving the Barrie House coffees!;positive
Love coffee with chicory and this is a really good deal. Best to go with a subscription.;positive
Love the cap on this bottle.  Last honey I bought, it was all over the place.  The honey is delicious.;positive
I like licorice and it's good, gives me something sweet and it's high in calories. It will last awhile and it has good flavor.  Love the strawberry;positive
Happy to have found a gum free of chemicals that I'm comfortable giving my family, a replacement for Trident, etc. We've been using for more than a year now.;positive
I'm pleased with the taste of this drink most of the time, sometimes its granular powder mix on the side of the pitcher;positive
This tea simply tastes great all by itself.  And it has just a small amount of caffeine for a really good lift morning or afternoon.;positive
Works great in baking and tastes good sprinkled on as well.;positive
"I eat rice, all kinds, pretty much on a daily basis.  Once again, convenience is great.  I have had it with butter, S&P; added it to chicken broth and used it in a casserole.  Good!";positive
Awesome! Especially when you buy a variety!;positive
HUGE bag of cashews...at a great price. What was surprising is how fresh they tasted. Getting thru Subscribe and Save which makes a nice deal even better.;positive
Love this, love cooking with it, but hey, we like pepper!!;positive
My young adult kids complained but I don't think it's bad at all. It works when you need a cup in a hurry.;positive
Wonderful flavor.  Lessens cravings for salts as the nutritionist said it would!  Since it gives you the minerals processed salt does not ans the minerals are what your body is craving!;positive
Clean fragrant flavor, leaves not stems, sound packaging make this a good buy.  Great for Posoles.  Also a great addition to mint tea.;positive
My daughter who thinks all healthy organic food tastes bad... says this tastes like movie popcorn! This popcorn is so delicious and so simply made. I'm so glad this brand began offering organic selections!;positive
Have used this seasoning for awhile while making not only fajitas, but also use as seasoning for ground turkey to spice it up and for chicken also.;positive
Came on time and filled with good beans:);positive
love this grapeseed oil it has a very light texture. will be buying more.;positive
Very pleased with seller, quick delivery, plus a wonderful product, one of my all time favorite seasonings, I always have a guest come up and ask what seasoning I used on my steak or hamburgers, its great;positive
This is the ticket for getting smooth cheese sauces that don't break down. Like magic. Even works on sharp cheddar.;positive
I made some great muffins with this flour which is difficult because I can't use dairy, egg, wheat, soy.  I just wish it was less expensive;positive
not as harsh as the horseradish based imitation wasabi.  earthy goes with just about anything.;positive
Great freshness. I will order again.;positive
Received canes really happy cannot find a cane in any of the stores I like putting them in my coffee thanks Tommy a.  I received my canes they are really good in coffee thank you Tommy a.;positive
So easy to incorporate into hundreds of recipes!;positive
Very good trail mix. Item was super fresh. Will  purchase again.;positive
I got this for my husband. He doesnt drink it often. He only drinks when he's working night shifts. He said this help him stay awake and alert.;positive
Great for adding to stir fry or soups. They soften right up with a little moisture. Adds that little bit of crisp texture.;positive
Much expensive than the Chinese Superamrket.;positive
Seems to be fine...everything looks in good shape, and is fresh, arrived on time, etc. I have not tried this flour yet, however.;positive
Old fashioned and good. One kid loves it with the jalapeo.;positive
This is actually pretty good stuff! Used fake cheese, Bega, fake meat,Caroline's vegetarian taco filling, a tortilla and some onions. Like eating at Taco Bell.;positive
Very finely ground pure cacoa powder. No sugar added. I add it too cereal, coffee, deserts, etc. Tastes great in everything so far.;positive
My favorite morning treat and the taste is wonderful ~;positive
I just like the taste and the fact that it's green tea I haven't lost any weight but I love it just the same.  Sweet mild taste unlike regular green tea.;positive
I used this emulsion to flavor my son's birthday cake. It was a hit, everyone complimented the cake, saying it tasted just like banana bread! Will definitely be trying other flavor emulsions in future bakes.;positive
Nice size and good price.  I keep at work and they do not take up a lot of room. Good to freshen your breath!;positive
"If you like a Strong Good Coffee, this one is for YOU ! ! ! Timothy's makes a Great Product and this one won't let you down !

"So nice to know that I can get great peppermint outside of ""Santa's Season""....real peppermint oil. And yes - it does make the difference.";positive
Lovely light tea.  Perfect when I was sick, or to drink just before bed.  The lemongrass is a wonderful addition.;positive
Love the fine grind and have used Himalayan salt for many years.  Can't stand table salt anymore.  Only 4 stars because the bag will not reseal as supposed to;positive
I like the taste of this product although I am a bit put off by the plastic container and I give it 5 stars for what I feel to be a superior product.;positive
This really tastes good & replaces sugar. 1-1;positive
Great product for baking meets quality one would expect of Bobs Red Mill;positive
Very good and fresh tasting almonds.;positive
Good clean flavor. at a good price.  Cans are a little heavy so you have to be careful when pouring, but the oil has a pleasant taste even in salads or dipping for bread.;positive
if you like ginger this makes great tea;positive
OMG I use this to make pizzels.  It is superior to anise extract..I would never go back to using the extract.;positive

good turmeric, but not as strong as the one from Simply organic. Better price though;positive
Its coconut. Good, fresh, no sugar added.;positive
I love this tea! I am a tea snob and this is the best tea available. Taste just like I brewed it myself. I subscribed to this-!!!;positive
Prefer Crimson Cup, but this is better than most.;positive
The only problem I found was that Costco had the same product 2.50 cheaper. That is a shame along with Amazon does not do price matching;positive
These were great.  Taste like regular egg noodles.  Couldn't believe they were low carb!!!;positive
This stuff is so good! It tastes like lemonade without being overly sweet and since it has no sugar in it, I can drink it whenever I want!;positive
These are perfect for out to sea times, if you don't have a microwave no worries just add hot water. Taste is great.;positive
the taste of these out do any other chocolate I have ever tasted. We love every one of these.;positive
kosher & gluten free & who doesn't love ketchup?;positive
have not used yet , but I have used this product before and I do like it.;positive

it makes the best powdered milk and is great for baking.;positive
Great taste and enjoy the unsweetened Chai.;positive
good to make tea, not very good to eat.;positive
delivered on time.  item as expected;positive
Beautiful avocados that become ripe in half week (on room temperature) to one week (into fridge). They are tasty and creamy.;positive
Great flavor.very sweet but not sickly sweet.;positive
This is the only mayo I can find that is not made from canola, soy or olive oils and since I cannot tolerate any of those, I am thrilled with this avocado oil mayo. It tastes great too!;positive
Our go-to brand for making home brewed ice tea.  Quite perfect, every time.;positive
The aroma when I opened the package...yes, I swooned it was so good!  Better than any cinnamon I have ever purchased.  Potent!  Wonderful!!;positive

Watermelon and green apple are my favorites and I will be purchasing some more- very happy with the watermelon. Really good candy;positive
It doesn't tzste much like pear or black currant, but it's an interesting taste.;positive
I get this for my adult daughter every xmas., if I got it any more often she would have no teeth left as this is some addictive sour candy!;positive
Great fresh flavor can get spicy so use care when using.would buy again if price was better.;positive
Good, very good cashews. A bit on the expensive side, but worth every penny.;positive
My husband love this, he eats it every week with blueberries in it, it great.;positive

"put on salad etc
this is the fatty one - powder is for protein";positive
love these for a quick hit of sugard;positive
"Now who does not like Mac-N-Cheese?

Organic.  Full flavored.  Healthy choice.  Value for money is good.  Well worth the price for a healthy diet.";positive
Wish the bottle was bigger so it could contain more yummy honey.;positive
Very unique and different taste. refreshing & I have found  IT cuts down on my head aches. THE Taste is great also.;positive
My mom loves Rocky Road anything.  We get these for Mother's day and for her birthday.  She is one happy mom.;positive
I tried a package of this sauce on a whim and really loved it - only to find that my local store discontinued carrying it.  So -- I ordered six!;positive
Great tasting tea. I like Jasmine Pearl best, but this is way cheaper and very good.;positive
See's is the best!!!!!!!!!! This was a gift for my daughter and her friend, who live in Florida. No see's store there, so they really appreciate it!!!!!!;positive
Tastes better than national brands I promise. All three are great and the consistency is perfect for ice cream or to add on top of desserts!;positive
Great price, love this brand as it is still the flavor my kids love but has a few less ingredients.  I have spent lots of money on natural peanut butters they no one will eat.  This one is a good compromise.;positive
LOve it! I had Pancakes that tasted like pancake for the first time in almost two years!;positive
Not much flavor but can't beat the price for Organic Green Tea.;positive
our favorite around here  very flavorfull;positive
I love these so much, they are terrific.;positive
For most food I use this , Lawrys salt, and paprika for a good mix;positive
We made quite a few things for Thanksgiving and have use it since very tasty. Great flour replacement and great gift for someone that wants something natural and gluten free!;positive
a little strong smelling but when you cook with it, it doesn't affect the dish you are cooking though.;positive
Very tasty and pleasing to the pallet.  Recommend all flavors of the Australian brand.;positive
This smells so pleasant it is hard to believe it is turp. I use it for insect repellent. The bugs do not like it.;positive
Love the peach flavor. It is good any time of day.  The tea is fresh and well packaged - a delight.;positive
This is definately not for putting on potatoes, etc.  It is, however, great to have in your pantry for when you need sour cream in a cooked recipe.  It has a good shelf life and is easily prepared.;positive
This is a fabulous seasoning, the wife & I love it. Brings a lot of flavor to your cooking. Must have, I promise you.;positive
very nice but it seems they all come broken - which is ok as I am consuming them but not for gifts.;positive
Good brand of Xylitol gum which is good for your teeth but the cinnamon is too strong for me and I love cinnamon.;positive
My favorites - still taste delicious.;positive
My husband keeps stealing these from me.  I bought him the regular tea candies but apparently he prefers these now.  They taste like caramel to me.  Low sugar per candy too.;positive
I started eating dark chocolate when all the information came out about the antioxidants it contains. I have tried virtually every major brand and this one has the best, richest flavor by far.;positive
Good stuff for adding protein to a smoothie or yogurt snack and put protein in a cup of coco.;positive
A healthy organic product at a great bulk price..;positive
Coconut is my favorite flavor. I love these Cliff bars for an easy meal on the go.;positive
"Best chocolate ever!
Works well with milk, Nestle chocolate powder and Instant coffee.";positive
a tasty alternative to peanut butter.;positive
Great snack for taking on longer road trips and hikes. The walnuts are a nice combination that balances out the slight acidity of the strawberries.;positive
These are good for the Nespresso machine. Other brands fit, but don't have the flavor.;positive
A flavorful good 'ol standby for a snack or a base to add an egg or even a little cooked chicken to fortify it a bit.;positive
Great tasting coffee for your morning cuppa.  Low acid was not mentioned in the product description and was not something I looked for, but it is low in acid for those of you who need that;positive
"when this quinoa arrived I was so excited, it was so large and light-weight.  And, the seller was so nice, following-up to ensure that it had arrived safely.  unfortunately, I did not get around to using it right away.  First use, it was super gritty, despite rinsing: like eating sand.  So the second time around, I soaked it for 10 minutes.  Again, gritty.  The 3rd and final time, I soaked it an hour.  Still gritty AND mushy.  The remaining uncooked quinoa has been thrown-away.

This is no reflection of the seller.  They were very thorough.";negative
"This product is shady as all hell. Yes, it is supposed to clearly be main ingredient of honey, but there is no ingredients list and I am pretty surr all food items are supposed to have at least that much, even if it was in a language other than english.

BTW, I taste the honey as as expected the watermelon is strong so I'm believing artificial flavoring but I'm not 100% as it could be very finely concentrated watermelon juice (very rare to find as an ingredient). Again, it was packed in a plastic bag opaque on one side and clear on the other w/ the barcode and hazard warning about the bag. No expiration date either.

For some reason there was loose honey in the bag, but I don't see any loss from the sticks in the bag.";negative
1500 individual packets of disappointment.  You are already denying yourself real sugar, don't add insult to injury by using off brand fake sugar.  Spend the extra couple of bucks and buy name brand.  I have these, I am sort of stuck with them for now because I am too cheap to throw them away.;negative
I do not like the taste of reaper;negative
It leaks.;negative
I'm sad to say this coffee tasted flat & papery. I was really hoping to be able to leave a better review. Very overpriced for what you're getting. We've tried many different coffees all purchased from the Amazon site. This was by far our least favorite;negative
Seemed watered down.;negative
it was stale when I opened it.;negative
Some manufactures have not learn that corn pasta has NO comparison to BROWN RICE and that is what is wrong with these, they break up as soon as you bring them to the boil  !!!  These were SO cheap I lost my way and after many years of knowing that fact !;negative
WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED, came today and the bag was all oiled up and the jerky was oilly too it was so nasty and hard n stale n tasted very nasty. will not eat any more gonna throw it in the trash right now. S8cks, AVOID AT ALL COST!;negative
first off, i got 28 cups, not 30. very nice variety of flavors. does not work with the k-cup keurig brewer. kept getting OOPS note. just transferring the tea into my metal tea strainer instead so as not to waste the order. very quaint, old-fashioned way to make tea. nice change of pace in this age of high-tech.;negative
Way too salty!;negative

Big mistake, I am stuck with 59 packets of these horrible tasting salad dressings.  Kraft has a decent rep when it comes to items like this but they really missed the mark when they produced this item.  Horrible very salty taste perhaps because it is lite dressing, although I have tried other Kraft lite salad dressings and they were not bad. Does anyone want to buy 59 packets of italian dressing?  I will more then likely wind up throwing these out unless someone in my family decides to try them and likes them.";negative
Yuk - these mints have absolutely horrid flavors.  They are nothing like the Bob's puffy mints.  I felt bad using them as filler for handing out Halloween candy.....  thank heavens I had chocolate bars to go with them!;negative
"I figured this was going to taste much like kelp but was surprised it has such a ""fishy"" taste to it. Many recommended putting it on a salad but I don't put salt on my salads and why would I want to change the flavor of a good thing? Not a picky eater but this just doesn't appeal to me. I don't know what I will do with it but will update this if I can find something I am willing to put it on. If you already like dulse, this appears to be a quality item, is packaged well and arrived on time.";negative
"I'm sorry I did not care for this at all.  It it way too bitter compared to several other culinary matchas I have tried!  I purchased this because it had so many ""rave"" reviews.  I prefer the Jade Leaf brand over this.  This matcha might be good in baking but for my morning almond milk lattes it was not.  Packaging also had a hole in the top when I got it.";negative
Arrived melted;negative
They all tasted the same.;negative
Smashed by water;negative
taste terrible;negative
So this came yesterday and I am VERY disappointed. I got 6 blood orange, 3 black cherry and 3 grapefruit. Where he hell is the pineapple??? This was suppose to be a VARIETY pack. with 3 of each flavor in it. When this is fixed I will adjust my rating.;negative
These were not as good as we had hoped. Bought them as favors and found most of them were hard and stale, especially disappointing considering the purpose and that they were individually bagged. Upon close inspection found the plastic had micro holes in it, creating air exposure allowing them to become stale and gross. Would not buy again.;negative
These are pretty gross. They taste like soap and are too tough. If you want good Jerky try the Turkey Jerky at Trader Joes or Matador products. Probably more expensive, but they are way more edible. I guess this just proves we all have very different taste buds. I will try to eat the rest of this, but it is just uhhhhh.;negative
Very bitter!;negative
Absolutely the WORST fake flavoring;negative
Ok but not great.;negative
"These are NOT a ""Product of United States"" as pictured, but rather are from Viet Nam.  Unfortunately I opened before reading the label, and found the almonds not very fresh, nor flavorful.  So I guess am stuck with them?  An expensive mistake.
Update: sellers response is to claim again that these are U.S. product and that they're fresh.  See photo labeled clearly, Product of Vietnam .2nd Update:  What a surprise that this sellers response is not to try to make this right in any way, but rather to argue that their claims of u.s. product and freshness are valid!";negative
The concept had me so excited! A cold creamer, in the flavor I like (French Vanilla), made from half almond milk and half coconut milk, unsweetened. What could go wrong? I have no idea exactly what went wrong, but somehow this did not taste good to me at all so I was very disappointed. I had high hopes for this stuff replacing international delight. I just switched to plain ol half and half from the dairy section at the local grocery store and called it a day. Mr. Nutpod, wherever you are, make your nut cream taste better, and I will gladly drink it. Until then, no thanks. I'd rather drink plain old almond milk/coconut milk/bovine milk than this product. Which is unfortunate.;negative
Was trying to eat healthier. So I bought this to make Burmese tofu and boy was it bitter. Just bites your taste buds. And smells like fish. I found that rather odd as I've never used it before. I tried to use it similar to bread crumbs or batter and it smelled and just was really unappealing.;negative
"This is worthless unless you need to grease your gears in your car.

"Having tried and loved the Spicy Chorizo variety of these Go Soups, I was eager to try another flavor. Please understand I write few reviews, most being items I love and want to share a good find. Only rarely does a purchase inspire me to submit a negative review. This is one of those, it being so awful, I poured it down the disposal after the second spoonful ( first taste..disbelief, second..disgust). I like curry, have enjoyed several varieties..hot, mild, green, yellow, etc. I like all the ingredients. The consistency as it poured out of the bag was unpleasant: a glob, a watery stream, another glob....the final bowl was a watery, worrisome looking sight. But my experience with Campbells soups has been positive..they're not exactly gourmet quality,lol, but good basic tastes. Comfort foods from childhood :-)

The taste was like curry that's gone bad, old.. maybe moldy?  Cheap curry powder? You got me..and I've cooked Indian, Chinese, etc for 30+ years, but the problem with this soup defies  definition.  Other reviewers have called it ""perfumey"", well..sorta. Other than appearance, and off-taste.. I can't offer any redeeming quality here..the veggies were pretty unidentifiable..a chopped gruel looking soup with a slightly greasy film on top.

Well, I feel a bit bad being so negative but trust me, when food hits my disposal without any attempt on my part to doctor it up, stay away, lol.

Try the Spicy Chorizo kind..I'm not a huge sausage fan in general but the blend of flavors, mildly spicy, rich, identifiable firm chunks, really good chili-like flavor..yummy for a dinner in a minute.

Next on my list to try is the Quinoa Chicken..Will add my impressions, of that soup if anyone's interested. :-)";negative
Came in broken cans. It was a mess.;negative
Not impressed with the taste;negative

"Normally we use Florida's Crystals Organic sugar in the plastic jugs.  We were nearly out of sugar & decided to order 6 bags of this sugar since we were in a pinch.  When it arrived & I opened the box (light as a feather was my first warning), I was floored.  The bags were flat - I repeat, flat! Not filled to bursting like the picture.  They are the exact same bags Davidson's uses for most of their bulk teas.  However they are not filled.

Okay, it says it's a 16 ounce bag.  If I wasn't on a organic sugar shortage I may have paid more attention.  You are paying for 2 Cups of sugar!  That's it.  Think about it.  Not only that but extreme waste in packaging.  I think the bags could hold 4 times the amount of sugar.  It's a shame I didn't think to take a picture of those paper thin bags of ""bulk"" sugar.

The final insult was the mess it was to get the sugar out of the bags.  It stuck to the sides & in the creases (like static).  Trying to get it out of those spots left the counter & floor with a fine coat of sugar.  The bags themselves are not paper.  They have a smooth coating on the inside & are a brown color on the outside.  I'm not sure what they are made of.  If you buy Davidson's Tea you will know exactly what the bags are like.

I gave it 2 stars over 1 because the sugar is organic & at least that is something.  There is nothing special about the sugar besides being certified organic. If anything it is a little lighter in color than some of the other brands of organic sugar I have purchased.  The size of the sugar crystals were about average.  Finer than some brands, about the same as others.  As I said, nothing special.  If you want to get the healthiest form of sugar try Rapadura.  Rapunzle sells it & it is organic (available on amazon).  Be warned it still contains the molasses & has a very strong flavor & brownish tan color.  If you enjoy the flavor of Rapadura you will be doing yourself a favor over regular sugar cane as it actually contains minerals etc.

If this is the only choice I have for organic sugar, I will settle on this, but I will not be happy - at all.  It is the manufactures responsibility to present an honest & accurate picture of what they are selling.  Especially when it is online & potential buyers cannot handle the actual product before making a purchasing decision.";negative
Not my flavor! Yuck!;negative
I had tried one of these from a sample pack and it was strong and full bodied. So I ordered this box of them and it's weak and just not good. I'm very disappointed. Perhaps I just received a bad batch. The sample (the yummy one) had the orange rim, like this photo. But the crappy ones have a lavender rim.;negative
I thought that this would be a pretty good decaf, so I ordered it.  After grinding the beans and making coffee for awhile, I gave it up.  It did not have the flavor that I wanted.  It is also a weak coffee.  I did find the best decaf bean coffee recently that I expecially enjoy, but I haven't found it on Amazon.com.;negative
I cannot open this product.  It comes with scored areas, however the scored area is not done properly and is totally unusable.  Some others have written about how they managed to finagle the product open.  I am not willing to wrestle this product open.  The fragrance is very strong, coming from an unopened container. I do not want to risk having this all over my kitchen.  It is also not eligible for return. Going in the trash.  $ lost.  Don't waste your money.;negative

"You need a CHAIN SAW to get through these ""noodles"", what are they made out of, shoelaces??  A KNIFE won't cut these.  I had a mouthful of these noodles and i had to spit out the entire mouthful.  You can't chew them!  How are people chewing these??  I have never had such miserable noodles in my entire life.  It feels like they're made out of plastic, i'm not even exaggerating.  I wish i hadn't bought a 6 pack, like a dummy.  And the saltiness!!  I should have read the label, my mouth was on fire just after one mouthful.  Way too salty, but i would have overlooked that if i was actually able to CHEW these.  Awful.";negative
I bought a Tassimo and I bought a Keurig and I kept the Keurig. The Keurig was easier to use with the K-Cups and they were much easier to find in the retail market. I also preferred the taste of the Keurig coffee selection.;negative
Incredibly fresh, crisp lovely pretzel sticks.  Just delightful.  For a while the item was out of stock.  I was so eager to buy that I checked back multiple times a day to see if the pretzels were back. I was fully prepared to buy three more containers a month at almost $16 a pop through subscribe and save.  Now I see the price increased $4.00 in two weeks. In total, the price has gone up $6.00 in last four months.  Our family and friends love this snack product.  But, at the end of the day that's all it is, a snack and I refuse to get ripped off on the price.  I'll buy another brand instead of taking the hit in my checkbook!  Get REAL.;negative
"I'm looking for a bold decaf and this was suggested to me.  Seeing the words ""Espresso"" and ""Extra-Bold"" in there I figured it had to have some ""punch.""  Sadly no. ""Extra-Bold"" it is not.  I'd have trouble even suggesting ""Boldly-Mild.""  I have to set my machine to the lowest of the 3 settings and it's still not a satisfying coffee.

I used to get these and drink it whenever my throat was hurting and I got mine last week

They water it down soooomuch!!!!! I use to be able to re brew it at least 2 more times after my 1st cup...not anymore. Not even my first brew is strong. Its so water down you barely taste it...its like drinking hot water with very little taste of licorice. ....just wow :(";negative

"I have no idea what red palm oil is supposed to taste like, but I couldn't tolerate this product. I ordered the palm oil because it is supposed to be one of the best natural sources of Vitamin E. I take a lot of supplements, many of which don't have the most pleasant taste, but this is by far the worst-tasting stuff I have ever tried.

It tasted very rancid to me, but again, I don't know what good red palm oil is supposed to taste like. Other reviewers have said it has a strong taste, but this was like dirty molded gym sock taste. I tried using it as a cooking oil, as a dressing, and by the teaspoon, but it just made me gag. Sorry, I can't recommend, no matter how healthy it is supposed to be.";negative

I can usually tell chocolate is stale by the white film of sorts that appears, such as in vending machine candy bars that have not been kept fresh, but with m&m's you can't see that because of the 'candy coating'. I will not purchase from this vendor again.";negative
Before i purchased this product i asked if it was a true fifteen pound bag. I was told yes it is,  so i purchased it. When it arrived i inspected it. It appeared to be sealed by the manufacturer and it stated fifteen pounds on the package.

Thats a heck of alot missing espically for paying over seventy dollars.;negative

"BPA is not proven to harm children or adults, however studies have led federal health officials to express concern about the safety of BPA. Eden Foods has been using BPA free cans since 1999. Natural Value told me their cans are BPA lined and they are considering a change in the future.

The beans are good, firm and a bit too salty. I will not buy any Natural Value product because of the BPA issue. All their cans are BPA lined. I feel cheated by a company that chooses to market an ORGANIC product in a can with a BPA lining when other choices have been available for over 10 years.

I'll buy Eden Foods canned products. All canned tomatoes are in BPA lined cans per government regulations. Freeze your own or buy in glass jars or cartons.";negative
When I bought these there was was no image for the ingredients. They contain corn syrup. There in no need for sugar in blueberries. If sugar is added, corn syrup is about the worst type of sugar to add. I really didn't want to eat them. They were also overly sugared, so the texture was a bit weird because of that. The ingredients need to be listed in item description or in the images of the product. I usually avoid corn ingredients when they are not labeled as GMO-free.;negative
Very disappointing. Looks like tofu in the box. Whipped beautifully and fluffy and I thought I'd love it but the taste is just awful. Not being able to eat any dairy at all I eat a lot of soy products but this had an intolerable tastes so I had to throw it away. A lot of money for this product and it's not at all what I could eat.;negative
"This is my first time roasting coffee and I bought these beans solely for the near 5 star review of them.  However, I can't say these beans are any good.  I like buying weird, unique things.  These beans seem to fit that category as they grow on the side of an ancient volcano valley, so I thought they would have an awesome or unique taste.  Sure, they are more expensive than store bought beans but why not, it was only $10.

I roasted using the popcorn popper method and it worked.  I read the package and it said to roast them a bit past first crack, but instead what I ended up with was a columbian dark roast blend, which was supposed to be delicious anyways and bring out ""brighter, sweeter, caramelized flavors"".  The roasted beans smelled pretty terrible to be truthful, and when I was resting them I had to keep them away - my throat hurt.

I let them rest for about 24 hours as many sources say to do.  I then roasted coffee and it tastes so plain, I can't even describe it.  It isn't bitter, it has body, but there is no other aspect or notes I can taste.  I am a huge fan of eight o clock coffee myself and I bought the whole beans (2.5 lbs) for about $10 at the grocery store and it really blows the Adrano out of the water.  I guess I like a blend of coffee beans and not single source.

I was excited, and I wanted to like this product.  But I really do not.  I've tasted store bought generically branded preground coffee in tin cans that have more interesting flavor notes than this.

I guess everyone has their own taste, but as for me, I need something more interesting than this.";negative
I bought this because I miss the taste of the Lipton tea I grew up with. When I was young, Lipton tasted so pure, and you had to hurry and take the tea out of the hot water before it got too strong. It also had more of a clear, astringent quality. Hard to explain. So I haven't had that experience in a long time, no matter whether I buy the bags or loose. Has Lipton changed since I was young? (I'm talking 1960s-70's- maybe later.) I've noticed a lot of food items have changed quality since then and have used cheaper ingredients and / or you get less. Anybody else remember a difference in the old Lipton? I thought buying the loose from Europe (which I think this is) would be better, but it's not.;negative
"I have had this product for 6 weeks.  The use by date is still 2 months away.  I opened it and there is a huge chunk of green molded product in the bottom of the package.

"Kellogg's FF Fruity Snacks are sorely lacking in taste which disappointed me. I purchased the Welch's FF Fruity Snacks prior to buying the Kellogg's snacks and have to say the Welch's rocked my tastebuds. Sorry Kellogg's, you just don't have it here.

I substituted the Welch's FF Fruity Snacks in place of chocolates and other fatty desserts for 6 weeks and lost 14 pounds. The fruity snacks had to taste good for me to stick with it. If I had started with Kellogg's, I'm afraid I would have given up.

So Kellogg's, give a little more flavor and maybe I'll try again. Meanwhile Fruity Snack Lovers, go for Welch's!!  :-D";negative
"actually, I love Tostitos Tortilla chips AND all their salt. And the most recent bag I got around April 24,2016 from Prime Pantry was so well-packed that not one chip was broken. No complaints there.
But the expiration on the bag was May 16 and those chips were NOT crisp and fresh. I know how they are meant to taste when they ""snap"" when you press them because they are so crisp. No so with this batch. And the taste just wasn't there either. Won't buy this product from Prime Pantry again. Other things I have purchased from the Pantry have been great; I just do not know what the problem was here.";negative
"My dentist recommended Spry, so I thought I'd give it a chance. It's pricier than most of the sugarfree gums I frequent, but it came recommended by an oral expert, so I figured it would be worth a try.

NOT WORTH IT.

Literally, after less than 4 minutes, the flavor is completely gone, and the gum itself reverts to a stale, slightly metallic, tough-to-chew state of existence. I'm not sure how much teeth cleaning the Xylitol in the gum itself is doing because it seems to lose flavor so fast. Correct me if I'm wrong, but xylitol is a sweetener, so if the sweetness of the gum is lost after a good (or bad?) 3 minutes, then there really wasn't that much Xylitol to begin with?

Also, further research showed that you actually need more xylitol than the amount in the gum itself before it proves to be beneficial.

Given how much xylitol is in the Spry gum, it's neither good nor bad to be chewing Spry, and what tips that balance towards ""No Thanks"" is the fact that it is not worth its value.

Also (this is USEFUL), I've tried the Spearmint, Citrus & Green Tea, and out of the three, the Green Tea tastes the weirdest. It's almost matcha-like in flavor, but there's something off, like it's almost like someone took the descriptions of what Green Tea tasted like without actually ever tasting it, and then tried to re-create the flavor in the gum. It's very artificial tasting, with the barest of hints of Green Tea.

This is USEFUL information for those who want to chew gum to freshen their breath, or prolong the feeling of minty goodness in their mouth for more than just a couple of minutes!";negative
This applies to all Chef-Boy-Ar-Dee foods (I've tried the Mac & Cheese, Chicken & Rice & Mini-Raviolis) in this 7.5 cup design.

"I searched high and low looking for gluten free, casein free, and dye-free sprinkles.  I thought I had finally hit the jackpot when I fell upon India Tree products and read the ingredient description here as of this review's writing.  Many India Tree products are indeed dye-free and good for those of us on the GFCF diet. I thought that these non-pareils would be the same high quality and natural ingredients as the rest of India Tree's decorating sugars.

I was wrong.  Got the HUGE jar of sprinkles today (dented; thanks Amazon shipping) and the ingredients are as follows:
Sugar
Corn Starch
Confectioner's Glaze
FDC Yellow 5
Red 5
Blue 1
food grade carnauba wax
FDC Red 40
Yellow 6
and Blue 2

I'm willing to pay a premium for good naturally colored sprinkles.  But when you're just the same as the sprinkles in the grocer's aisle, I don't know what's the point?  Next time, only buy India Tree's ""natural"" product line.

My family loves Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Stevia. After purchasing the 3 pack boxes twice, from Amazon, I decided to save some money and invest in the 1000 packet box. When the box was delivered, it seemed a little sticky. When I unpacked the inner carton from the delivery box, I found that the vendors carton was sticky all over the outside of the box. Upon opening the carton, the stickiness was even worse inside, covering the individual packets. I was disappointed, thinking that loose powdered sweetener must have spilled into the box when it was packed, but I stored the carton believing there was nothing to worry about. After finishing our last small box of Stevia, I removed some of the packets from the bulk carton I had stored, to put into our counter top dispenser and found that MANY of the individual packets were not completely sealed! This is where the stickiness had come from - leaky packets had partially emptied into the carton. I was dismayed.  It would appear that, after spending over 60 dollars on the bulk package, I didn't save money at all, and have a mess on my hands to boot. I may be looking for another source of stevia.;negative
"This tea is terrible; cheap store tea bags taste better. All of the flavors blend together to make the green tea taste like a mixture of earl gray, raspberry, and peach.

I emptied the bag and let the pods air out for a couple of days. I put them in a jar and when I opened it a few days later the menthol smell was back. After a few months I just opened a few pods and crushed the seeds. There is no way I can use these for anything other than making a menthol rub. I really wish I could get my money back for these.;negative
"I get all my coffee from FRC and it is usually great. The beans are always fresh and oily....however not this time.
First off, the package that arrived was in the older white packaging, so no clue how long it's been on the shelf...which also means it was not depicted correctly on the site.
Second, the beans were completely dried out and brittle.
I'm returning this and hoping to have better luck next time.
The pic is a side by side comparison to the current bag of FRC and then the new bag I just got. You can see the difference from the awesome oily beans to the new bag that is all dried out";negative
"I have celiac disease, and my reaction to eating gluten is the dreaded DH rash - I have never had gastrointestinal symptoms from eating gluten. I used to be able to eat these bars with no issues at all, but the last few boxes I've had have caused my gluten reaction rash AND diarrhea/intestinal upset. I tested this several times, and ate nothing else new, and every time I ate these bars I would break out in the rash within an hour and wind up with nausea/diarrhea. I am not allergic to peanut butter, because I can still eat different brands of peanut butter and I do so regularly, without issue. I tested other gluteny foods and still only get the rash from them, so it seems I am either sensitive to something else in this product or it has trace amounts of gluten that are causing problems for me. For a while I thought that something was happening to the bars when they sat in hot trucks before delivery, because the last few deliveries I've received have been on hot days and the entire box of bars were melty and very warm, but I also tested this by buying a box from an air conditioned store and had the same reaction.

I should note that if I eat most brands of ""gluten free bread"" or ""gluten free pasta"", I also get the DH rash. This product now joins the list of ""gluten free versions of gluten foods"" that I absolutely can not touch. If you have celiac disease but find that you can't eat the common ""gluten free"" commercial foods, DO NOT BUY THESE. For the record, my only other diagnosed allergies are to mold and ragweed, but I have contact dermatitis reactions to citrus oils and bananas, and rosacea. Hopefully this helps someone else!";negative
A new low for Amazon expiration dates. I'm used to short expiration dates but these expired 4/13/18, more than 2 months ago. And they are so crushed that it would be a stretch to call them crackers, more like cracker crumbs.;negative
The packaging facility for Anna and Sarah may contain an above average amount of cockroaches. I bought a bag of dates and a bag of rotten figs, both bags had at least one dead cockroach in each bag (and what appears to be insect fecal matter inside some of the dates). I did not ask for a refund for the dates because I ate about 1/2 of the bag with only about seven bad dates before realizing that the rest of the dates were not really worth picking through. (I also did not really want to bother the people at Anna and Sarah again to get a refund.) I did receive a refund for the figs.;negative
This beef jerky taste more like over done steak that was left in the marinade too long. The pieces look machine made instead of natural chunks. The taste is a little off and it is way too chewy like it has not been dried enough.;negative
"I love cookies. I love birthday cake. I love frosting. So it was a real bummer that I didn't love these Chips Ahoy filled cookies. I ordered via Amazon Prime so it was super quick shipping, but the cookies arrived totally broken. That happens, though, so no big loss...but the flavor just wasn't for me. These were almost TOO sweet, and though they were indeed stuffed with some white cream I didn't taste enough ""birthday cake"" to justify rummaging through all the broken pieces of cookies. I'm obsessed with Chips Ahoy's S'mores filled cookies which is what struck up my curiosity about these, but I was left disappointed and wouldn't purchase this particular flavor again.";negative
It's an odd tea, and it totally does not live up to the peach aspect of its name so if you are looking for something with a peach kick, this is not going to be a good choice. It has sort of an indescribable flavor to it, and it does seem to have a bitter aftertaste but nothing too strong.  I'm honestly glad I only bought on box of it, and not the 6 pack that is sold on Amazon as I doubt it would have ever gotten used.;negative
blech  ... inedible ...;negative
Too burnt;negative
"I got these after reading about them in Alicia Silverstone's ""The Kind Diet."" I didn't feel that they helped my digestion at all, and I didn't feel any better health-wise then I did before trying them. They were also very salty, and had a horrible aftertaste that lingered for awhile.";negative
Pretty close to the worst thing I've ever eaten.  But, will keep the other 6 packets for the apocalypse,  Glad it keeps 25 years, I don't expect to be here long enough for the next dose.  (wife of the one who ordered this stuff).  If you do cook this, suggest adding the maximum amount of liquid that it calls for, (perhaps more if needed).  As a child, I was in a private school for a few years (parochial).  They used to serve what I called gruel (unidentifiable slop).  I never thought I would have anything that would compete with that.....until now.  I will say though that it did not leave a bad taste in my mouth, so there's that.;negative
"Having had the Low Fat Fig Newman's from our local  store several times and we enjoyed them very much. That when I found these as I was putting  a subscribe and save order together, I had enough confidence in the brand to try them.

That was an unfortunate mistake.  1 they don't seem to be as organic as they use to be, which is a shame.  2 they are absolutely tasteless and extremely chewy.

We don't believe in throwing food away that isn't spoiled or expired if we can help it. So we have several more packages to gag down. They are gross and I would never recommend them.";negative
"Just a personal matter of taste but my first impression is that I must not know ""good"" coffee because I odered a box of 24 because of all the good ratings and after 3 swallows poured it down the drain. I didn't get any vanilla taste ""natural"" or artificial.  I tried again and this time doctored it up with cream which I seldom use but thought it might save me from wasting 22 servings. First impression are often accurate. I think I must like mild not medium roast and stronger flavored coffee if they are artificial. For comparison .. I really love Hamilton Mills toasted cinnamon. I hope this helps someone and saves them $16.50.";negative
GAVE THEM AWAY. HAD AFTER TASTE;negative
Tastes like prunes.;negative
I love trying new foods on a market, especially tea. What can I say...it says with CHIVE on a package..and it tastes exactly what is says -))) I guess I expected too much, but onion flavor is very strong and overpowering the whole tea. It does taste more like a vegetable broth then tea -))) I still don't regret that I bought it, because I was curios. I am gonna use it in cooking instead veggie broth, don't want to waste $7 -));negative
I wanted to like these.....I bought them to replace the chocolate chip fetish I have in my overnight oats. I put these in instead and they are so bitter and completely not tasty....I didn't expect them to be sweet like chocolate chips, I wanted more a crunchy texture piece to it, which they delivered on...but the taste. Not. So. Good. :-( I'm going to try them putting them in my juices instead - I think they'll be fine in the nutribullet.;negative
I bought this by mistake, needing the fine ground  It was awful. seemed really dirty -- I dissolve a teaspoon of salt in 2 cups water to use it and this would leave particles that didn't dissolve and were suspended instead of dropping to the bottom. Not at all nice. As I said, it looked like impurities to me. I quickly went back to the fine ground and am happy again.;negative
I have been buying Maple Syrup for several years and this is the worst one I have ever bought.  It is much thinner than what I am used to and lacks a good flavor.  I would not buy it again.  It was kind of pricey for the amount that was in the bottle.;negative
"Ants - little tiny crispy ants.  Dead but there.  Bought this box of chips for a luncheon and 6 out of 9 opened bags had ants - we threw then all away of course.
These bags are not deflated, were not opened prior, have no holes - but they have ants.
Disgusting.
Lay's are one of my favorite chips and although I will still buy them, I will not buy them in this packaging again.";negative
This tasted really nasty to me.;negative
Not fresh and sweet;negative
I got two 2lb bags of these for work and I am not pleased at all.  There are so old that the hard candy has melted inside the wrapper and they are a mess.  I've gone through about 10 pieces from each bag and they are all a sticky, melted mess.  I certainly won't be taking these to work or buying candy from this place again.;negative
The seasoning had fallen off and was in a Dusty pile in the bag.  The almonds didn't have much flavor.  I ended up tossing them because they made a huge mess with all the powder getting everywhere.  Not a fan.;negative
"Old and awful tasting. Thank goodness amazon gave me a refund because these were just terrible.

Such a disappointment: I had just purchased some wonderful walnuts from amazon: Whole Terra Organic Raw Walnuts Halves & Pieces - unfortunately, they were out of these so I tried the NOW Foods brand. After all, they are just walnuts - raw, organic, Non-GMO - what could go wrong? Well, these tasted so awful that I kept trying to think of what I could possibly use them for - in cookies or something? - but I couldn't bring myself to ruining my baked products.

I really should have read the reviews first - many people experienced the same problem. I will be more careful next time.";negative
This was my second order of this item. The first time, the candy was very good. The second order however contained pieces that were wadded up and some of the chocolate had the white like surface. These problems are caused by the candy being partly melted and then being rehardened. I don't know for sure what happened but it is unappetizing.;negative
I LOVE the idea, but not so fond of the taste.  I love ginger, but I didn't like the minty taste I get from these.  It was a package of 6 bags of these things.  So I snack on them once in a great while.  They are better for you than chips but I won't be a repeat customer.;negative
"Neither my wife nor I like this product.  The original WITHOUT the fake blueberries is very good.  Look at the list of ingredients; there are NO BLUEBERRIES in it, period.  It is artificial crap.  Sorry,  I calls them as I tastes them.  I was under the mistaken impression you were getting dehydrated blueberries; you are not.  Also the little bits and pieces sometimes do not totally soften (you leave the liquids in the mix for at least 5 minutes before you bake so they can hydrate).  I rarely ever give a product a one star; really, just avoid this and save yourself the grief.";negative
I recently traveled to Nashville for a business trip and tried this sweet treat.  It is amazing!  I was happy to find them available on Amazon and promptly placed an order.  My account was charged and I waited for my sweet treats to arrive.  However, they did not.  Five days after the latest anticipated arrival date and two emails to the company Lolli City later, no answer.  I just filed a claim with Amazon to get my money back.  If you're looking for Goo Goo Clusters, or any kind of candy, DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!  They are completely unprofessional and you will not receive what you pay for.;negative
Not particularly good, even for a cheaper balsamic. When I ordered, the listing was for a 10yr aged product. By the time I received delivery, the listing had been changed to reflect the cheaper product I received. We don't enjoy it, but we've grown accustomed to nicer balsamic (usually Zingerman's);negative
"Really poor taste. It tastes nothing at all like real wasabit; the closest taste is plain old mustard powder. Whether I let it mature for ten minutes, twenty minutes, or sixty minutes, it never develops a wasabi taste. The resultant mess is bland, bitter, and unpalatable. Avoid this product at all costs.";negative

"Probably the worst popcorn we've purchased as in stale taste. No consistency or flavor for the money spent.

Too salty for me.;negative
"We like the taste of the sauce. But over time, we kept adding less and less because of the sweetness it adds to food.

When I looked more closely at the ingredients, I realized that the sweetener is high fructose corn syrup which is mainly fructose. Recently fructose has been implicated in diabetes and fat gain.

I have tossed out all foods in my house that contain HFCS. When Mr. Yoshida and other food companies decide to use sugar rather than fructose, I will be back.";negative
"Works great just as it says it does. Only if you know you have a harder time than others to go, I suggest you use 2 tea bags at once instead of just 1, then you will see the magic happen.(couple of hours later)

Update March 3/16: I just noticed they ramped their prices way to high for a tea box, yes it's great because it works but doesn't mean they should've changed the price. Folks before purchasing here, check out TJMAX first (that's where I bought my first tea box at $3.00).";negative
"I was very disappointed with this bacon. The bacon itself is extremely greasy. The sweetness is there but very vague. It had an odd sweetness too like a smoked sweetness, couldn't exactly place it. The bacon is extremely chewy. You also REALLY don't get much at all. Think this is prob the most expensive I've gotten so far, and I've reviewed quite a few.

Not to mention the bacon they used just didn't taste great.";negative

"I really made a mistake ordering these, but in my defense, I didn't notice anything in the description to give me a clue that these are really chocolate covered cookies, not regular graham crackers.  But I thought, well, at least maybe I'll get some antioxidant value from the chocolate; but no, come to find out it uses ""Dutch"" alkali processed chocolate, so no redeeming value there.  They actually don't even taste as good as regular graham crackers.  I guess I'll have to stow them away until the next food drive.  I'm sure if someone is hungry enough, they'll probably get eaten.";negative
This was a mess. I order a lot of creamers (we use large quantities for hospitality purposes at work) and am accustomed to variety packs of creamer having each flavor boxed individually, then the boxes are bundled together for shipping. When this arrived, all of the creamers were loose, mixed together in a single box. To make things worse, some of it had broken open, and there was a sticky mess in part of the box. We were able to clean off and salvage most of it, but it was a long tedious process and impossible to remove all of the sticky spilled creamer even from the cleaner ones. It eventually soured, and the smell prompted us to throw away about 15 of them. I have been very careful about subsequent orders, to avoid this sort of bundling.;negative
If you like eating something that eats like rubber this is for you. The fettuccine was like overcooked calamari. Same with the noodles. The rice package was almost empty and consisted of part rice, part string like stuff. The spaghetti at least was sort of edible if you let the sauce soak in, but it too was rubbery. I threw away the lasagna & the couscous. So disappointed. There used to be a product called newdles on Amazon but it's no longer available. Too bad. Newdles was a pretty good product.;negative
"I bought this thinking it was a product from an entity trying to deliver pure habanero with a little salt and vinegar.  But its nothing more than any other red or fully ripened habanero sauce on the market.

The bottle uses a cork as a bottle sealer.  I would prefer something threaded just for that extra peace of mind when shaking a bottle of habanero sauce.

The sauce is too thick for the opening, so it's like ketchup from the old days, you will struggle to use this product.

I also don't care for this sauce because of it's flavor.  It's not anything like the Habanero sauce I make from these same 3 ingredients but using the common orange habanero.";negative
This was not a good taste in my mouth, it has a weird chemical sweet taste mixed wix an odd peanut butter taste. I gave it 2 stars because it does look pretty healthy but I can't handle the taste, I gave it to my husband because he will eat most anything and he is not so sure about it...;negative
I have several Wild Friends nut butters and wasn't impressed with this one, it didn't have much taste. Several that I ordered together I wasn't thrilled with. I was hoping for something similar to the Trader Joe's cookie butter, not even close.;negative

"I'm not a coffee snob, I promise. Why else would I have ordered a bag of cheap, already-ground coffee?

But I do like my coffee to taste good, generally speaking. I'm going back to the Folgers Vanilla Biscotti and similar choices for everyday use. Costs a tad more, but even thrifty-minded me doesn't want more of this stuff.";negative
"I really like the plain coffee from Krispy Kreme.  It's my favorite coffee anywhere, unless I go somewhere snooty or grind the beans myself.

Unfortunately, this coffee is incredibly weak.  Much lighter than Starbuck's light Keurig coffees.  If I have it black, it's slightly bitter but mostly watery, and doesn't really taste anything like the store version.  If I have it with any cream or sugar, it's a struggle not to completely overwhelm the flavor of the coffee.

I am not a Keurig coffee snob, they're pretty much all fine by me.  And this doesn't actually taste bad.  However there's a hundred other varieties of Keurig and most are cheaper, so there's absolutely no reason to get this one.";negative
"I have ordered these several times with no problems -- sure they were sometimes cracked, but that didn't affect the way they tasted or their usefulness. My last order however, arrived with over-cooked and flattened cakes that tasted nasty. It also didn't help that they were stale. Then I noticed that the twisty tie on each package was loose. No wonder they were stale!

I contacted the company that sells them, Delice, twice and was never told how or even if I can return them for another case. At this time I don't plan to reorder unless they can guarantee the freshness and quality that I expect given the size of the case and the cost.

I'm really sad about this because I love them.

UPDATE: 4/9/2014:  FYI, if you purchase these through Amazon, you are able to use the A-Z guarantee and file a claim for a refund. I think as long as you show good faith in attempting to work with the seller, Amazon will refund your money, less shipping cost. Since I got my money back I'm planning to reorder later in June. Hopefully the manufacturer will have corrected their quality assurance issues. At least I now know that I won't be out the full $35 if I get another bad batch from Delice.";negative
"UPDATE: Not only has the price doubled from what I paid in 2011, I noticed in the last case when looking at the tomato pieces, there are an unusually high amount of sections that contain stem vein pieces (theyre hard with a greenish area).

I plan to call them and ask about this, because out of about 12 pieces, 7 were center/stem sections. I can see if perhaps 3 out of 10 were, but out of a whole tomato being diced, theres no way it should be 7 out of 12. They must be using lower quality parts for the diced tomato cans.

Look closer and you'll notice a faint greenish or more yellow area and when pressed with finger they're hard and don't give like a regular tomato section does. I know I might seem fussy, but the price should alot lower than the cans with larger tomato pieces, not higher.

Older review:

These are great canned tomatoes, but I don't understand how they were 14.40 in November and now they're 22.00 ?

Also, the BPA situation is serious. But the reason it's still being used is because BPA is essentially an unregulated chemical.  See [...]

From page 4 -
""None of the regulatory agencies, all of which are heavily dominated by chemical industry interests""...they just didn't know what to do with this (a hill of new research)  ""And the choice is, they've got 100,000 chemicals in commerce. They actually have regulatory authority over a small number of them, because in the 1970s with the Toxic Substance Control Act, they grandfathered in 62,000 chemicals, including BPA, that are totally outside the regulatory system. So there's no regulation of BPA""

But in January, 2010, the FDA did something remarkable -- it reversed its position that BPA is safe, and said we agree with our science advisory agency that there is reason for concern for prostate cancer, for early puberty, for a variety of things. This was a huge breakthrough. Now we actually have a government agency that has accepted that this is a chemical to be avoided. But they said, ""We're sorry, but we do not have the authority to do that. We don't even have the authority to go to the chemical industry and say, `What's this in?' We can't even find that out."" It's a grandfathered chemical.""

""What the FDA said is, ""We are working with Congress to try to get laws changed."" But changing the rules that we operate by, if we had a compliant industry, would take five to 10 years. And this is one extremely non-compliant industry. It's almost a $10 billion-a-year product. You know, people don't give up that kind of money.""
---
One problem other than early puberty in females (because it mimics estrogens) is the feminization of boys and males (including affecting their development in-vitro from the mother's consumption of BPA as well as soy proteins)  that we don't often read about. This could produce a national security problem, if we are developing feminine boys (watch the feminists scream at me :))

Either way, I figured people who purchase organic products would appreciate being made aware of this, if they weren't already :)";negative
I've been using this product for several months and it's had the same consistency and flavor. The last batch I got had a different consistency, somewhat flaky, and a very foul odor and strong sour foul taste. I can't use it. Also, when mixed with water, the water turned an amber color which had not happened before either. I'm going to call the company about it in the morning. Not so sure if they changed the formula or I just got 4 cans that are bad. Either way, I'm hesitant to use it.;negative
Do people really eat this trash?;negative
"I wouldn't call it an aftertaste, necessarily, but each of these three flavors has an ""off"" note to it. Because it's all three flavors, I'm assuming it's the kind of stevia they used (have heard of stevia that has a bitter aftertaste). Regardless of what the reason is, I find that I much prefer the Stur I ordered at the same time.";negative
I bought these as an alternative to soda pop. These taste terrible!!!! There's no fizzy left once the capsule dissolves and you are left with nasty tasting drink. So not what I was expecting. Ill take a kool aid pack over this any day.;negative
"I have been using this product for many, many years and always considered it the best organic extra virgin coconut oil available. However with the new packaging, Nutiva claims it's the same product but that is NOT  true!  Prior to the new package design, this product was extra-virgin; the new packaging design states on the label that it  is the same product but it is NOT! It is now virgin rather than extra virgin.

Nutiva needs to clear up this contradiction and provide the product as promised on the label.";negative
The dates are too dry.;negative
Not good, my opinion only;negative
It is so much cheaper than buying it in the small packages. I store it in sealed container and made it super easy to use by writing 1 packet = 2 1/4 teaspoon right on the lid. This makes converting recipes that call for packets super easy to convert. I made several different recipes with this yeast. 2 separate times I made French bread and one cinnamon roll recipe. None of them turned out. I am very disappointed.;negative
Really a mixed bag. Good on price from a per cup standpoint, however you really are taking chances on what you get. Some were good, a few great and some like dishwater. Just dumped into the box, no packing or anything. Wouldn't buy again, but was attracted by the low cost.;negative
"What a mistake this was, I ordered it for my neighbor that takes care of my house when I am away and it was so bad that I tossed all of the fruit and went to the supermarket and refilled the basket.

The oranges were the worse, they looked like the ones a supermarket throws out for being too old, the skin had that dried out look and the two I cut open were dry. The pairs were nearly rotton, were bruised and punctured, the Kiwi had a mushy skin (it is ok for the inside to be mushy). The only reasonable piece was the Granny Smith Apple, which seemed fine but given the condition of the other fruit it went into the trash also.

For what they charged you get about 4 bucks worth of fruit and a basket. The basket was nice and that was about it and it  probably tasted better than its content but I did not try it...

I could not recommend this to a friend or really to anyone.";negative

We used to buy vitamins from them buy i plan not to in the future. Amazon is being quite helpful in resolving the issue.";negative
"This is the new and improved Wrigley's Spearmint.  I was buying this for my mother who wanted the old classic Wrigley's Spearmint and was looking all over town for it.  This is not it.  If you're looking for the classic flavor you remember, do not buy this.

According to a candy blog, the Classic Spearmint flavor has been permanently discontinued.  How disappointing, eh?

Gave both cases (silly me, I bought 2), to a 23 year old.  He loved it!

Maybe we should all write to Wrigley's and ask them to bring back the classic spearmint flavor.";negative
"I tried ""Dang"" and it was pretty good, but the price was too expensive. I was hoping that this alternative would be at least as crunchy but the batch I got was STALE. Extremely stale, it's almost like hardened rubber. Now I pretty much have to throw these out. :/";negative
If you like proper English tea this is not for you. I use three of these to get close to an English brew.  Waste of money and now I have six boxes minus 12 teabags from one box.  Buy. PG tips, Typhoo teabags or Yorkshire .  I've warned you!;negative
I was looking forward to trying something new,however when I opened the noodles they were oily and had a rancid smell. I checked the date on the box and it was good for another year so I cooked it anyway. The sauce was good but couldn't get past the noodles. Maybe it was the type of oil they used. I threw it out and cancelled my subscription. I am afraid to order any other products of this kind. Any suggestions? Sorry, don't like to leave bad reviews.;negative
JUNK;negative
Taste very quickly fades.  Small.;negative
I can't get past the bad taste and lingering after taste. I've tried eating them right out of the bag...yuck. I tried soaking them then rinsing them...yuck. There's no way I was going to mix this in with my oatmeal. It has a strong bizarre flavor I find hard to describe. This is not going to be a repeat purchase. I really wanted to like them because I read how healthy they were but omg, NO!;negative
"Unfortunately, the flavor of this biltong is not something any of my family likes. I was hoping my son would take it for snacks when he's playing Ultimate Frisbee, but he really didn't like it at all. I'm disappointed because it doesn't contain any nitrates or msg, so it would have been a great product for my family.

UPDATE: ended up throwing a 90% full bag away since I couldn't find anyone to eat it-everyone hated it. I too wish I'd sent it back since there are lots of reviews saying it's a bad product (especially since there is a difference between the 8 oz and 16 oz according to one reviewer). This was really expensive and I hate to throw any food away. Very unhappy.";negative
I am dieting and was so happy to find Melba Toast on Amazon because stores don't seem to carry it any longer. However, it's just too hard to be tasty. I love crisp, but this stuff goes way beyond that anymore. I will have to find a better option to get my crunch.;negative
Arrived melted and very discolored.;negative
Leaves were tasty enough but, OMG, they were so tough and stringy.  For not having many tender leaves inside this jar, I found this to be very expensive and a waste of money.  I was embarrassed to serve these tough, stringy leaves to my guests.  Very disappointed after making the filling and rolling grape leaves all day for them to not be very good because of how tough and stringy they were.  They tasted okay but they were tough.  Nobody likes a tough grape leaf ... at least not in my Middle Eastern family.  No, I would not buy this again.  I guess I'll have to make my own ... ugh... so time consuming but at least people eat what I've made and like it.;negative

"It tastes good and if you are going to eat/drink whatever you use it in right away, then you shouldn't have a problem. However, I used it to sweeten herbal tea that I made. I made 2 quarts and put it on the fridge in a pitcher. Within a couple of days, mold was growing in the tea. I figured it was a fluke.

I tried a different tea and used a sealed container this time. It took a few days longer, but mold still grew.

I do not have this problem with other sweeteners or even real sugar. Crystal light, sweet tea, or anything else really has not grown mold in my fridge. However, this stuff did. I tried it with unsweetened tea and there was no mold.

So, if you don't mind using it as you go, you should try it. But don't expect it to be good if you have something sitting around - even refrigerated.";negative
First of all,the product is not from Kraft foods any more. A company called Mondelez bought it and has apparently changed the recipe. I am from Germany and know Milka for 40 years since I was a child. It used to be the most delicious chocolate you can put in your mouth! Now it tastes overly sweet, less hazelnut flavor and with a waxy consistency, not melting in the mouth like it used to. You didn't have to chew it, it just melted. Thanks a lot, Mondelez for ruining this brand! Milka Noisette is forever gone!;negative
I know Flake. I eat it every time back home and this is not close to what flake taste like. Moreover, the product is not meant for resale as it was writing on it. POOOOOR quality not like the original flake. (BUY it and you will regret it if you have tried the good flake chocolate)  wasted 16 USD for nothing;negative
Maybe it is just that I only rarely had one or two of these, and did not notice that they do not really taste very good. They have kind of a funny aftertaste. I am not sure if this batch is bad, or if this is just a candy that I do not really like very much. But I am wishing that I had ordered something else.;negative
"I consider myself somewhat of a connoisseur of coffee, who has worked at several coffee joints, but not Starbucks, and has seen thousands of different coffee's in my travels. One thing is for sure, it is almost impossible to screw up a Columbian bean, but First Colony has found a way. If you would ever go to Colombia and purchase a bag of coffee off the grocery store shelf, it would be a thousands time better than this brand. My first clue is the oily surface, which tells me that it has cooked too long. Colombian coffee is considered, by most roasters, to be  a relatively mild to medium flavored bean, unless you cook it to death. Ideally, the Columbian bean should NEVER be roasted more than medium, which is the point in the roast before the oils come out of the bean. When oils come out, flavor leaves with it, leaving a harsh and acidity taste. If you want an oily bean with a more robust flavor, your best to try some of the French or Italian roasts. Case in point. When my wife and I traveled to France and Italy several years ago, most coffees are not the bitter coffee's you find here in the states, instead you'll taste wonderful coffee often not matched here, a robust, low acid, naturally flavored bean. In Europe they know that we Americans like coffee and they have a brew just for us, a medium flavored DOUBLE sized cup called the ""American"" (os). If you want to taste a coffee that replicates the European flavor, try the brand Illy, either the ground or the bean.

I must qualify the method of brewing coffee in our house. First, I use a coffee machine called a super automatic which I can control the amount of coffee per cup and the size of the ground. This machine is similar to the professional machines you see in coffee shops, but it operates at half the speed. If my machine goes asunder, my second method is a French Press. French presses work well, but you have to watch the ground size: the finer the grind, the harder it is to push the plunger. A drip coffee maker would be my third choice, but also my last choice.

I give the coffee two stars instead of one only because it is about $1.50 less per pound than my normal Colombian bean.";negative
Really, really disappointed!! For $9 you expect a good amount of candy, well you get barely a cup full DON'T be deceive  like I did. The color is nice but I brought these for a candy bar and it's almost embarrassing what a small amount I'll be putting on the table.;negative
Very disappointed with this product especially since I bought the lemon and it was pretty good .Where as this orange I put five packets in a 16 oz and still could not taste a difference in water , as if I put nothing in water . The lemon I used two packets in 16 oz.and got at least a weak flavor of lemon which was good enough for me . But this orange has NO flavor at all , just makes the water look foggy .Will not be buying either again .;negative
I am so sorry to say that i did not enjoy these at all. I have hardly even eaten one whole cracker and it actually makes me sad because Health Valley is a trusted name to me and my family. We have never had a product from Health valley that we did not like til these crispbreads. I have such a bland diet and i can eat just about anything short of cardboard and I really do apologize for saying this but they were and are disgusting. It wouldn't bother me so much if they were not so expensive but they were and I am stuck with them .  I wish I could get my money back!!!!;negative
The shipment of my first order of San Francisco Bay Hazelnut Cream whole beans arrived in a timely manner with my Subscribe and Save shipment, and I couldn't wait to sample it. So it was with great anticipation that I ground just the right amount of beans for my 2-shot espresso maker and brewed my first cup.  I'm sorry to report that I was extremely disappointed with its flavor!  This grind tasted stale, bitter, and dull--rather than fresh, nutty, and complex. The hazelnut had an artificial taste to my palate.  All of which made me wonder if the beans were 1) roasted incorrectly/for too long or 2) were stored improperly past their freshness?  And if neither of those issues were true, then was this bag labeled incorrectly?  Over a span of 10 years, I've experienced several other coffee roasters' Hazelnut Cream flavor--including Safeway's--which I absolutely adored. For my money, SF Bay Hazelnut Cream flavored coffee is just not worth its premium price.  :(;negative
"This is a very disappointing order.  I opened the container and detected a strong scent of rancid oil.  I ate one nut and it tasted like chemicals, something like bleach.  I have always eaten fresh Brazil nuts that I shelled.  They always tasted very nice.

Whatever these nuts are they have certainly been processed in a way that makes them unpalatable to say the least and more likely just uneatable.  I certainly will not eat them.  If I had some pigs I wouldn't even let them eat them.  I can only guess at what they did to these nuts but I think I have a pretty good idea.  I think the nuts became rancid and they attempted to clean them up with a detergent that has a high bleach content.

I will just buy some fresh Brazil nuts in the shell and toss these in the trash.";negative
were melted and hard to unwrap;negative
I normally purchase the Yoga Organic Raspberry leaf tea-but couldn't find the multi pack so I ordered this in the multi pack. I buy it b/c it tends to help with all sorts of menopausal symptoms, especially hot flashes. I drink about 3 cups a day. However, the Yoga brand tastes very mild while this one is strong. I've explained to people that it tastes like what I would imagine a tree tastes like. Sounds funny but to me it tastes like wood might taste. Nothing offensive, just not what you would drink for the sheer pleasure of it. This tea however does taste strong, maybe it has a root type of taste to it? Yuck, not for me. I went back to the yoga tea, much more pleasant.;negative
nothing at all like milk chocolate. almonds are chopped fairly small not left full like in a hersheys almond chocolate bar. overall, was disappointed and will probably throw away as i absolutely hate bitter dark chocolate and thats exactly what this tastes like.;negative

Since it was  ""Sold by Common Cents Distributors and Fulfilled by Amazon"" to get a refund I must return the unused packets.";negative
Its yellow/pea-green, not grass green and its made with Chinese tea rather than Japanese sencha.  The quantity is outrageous: you get about 1/10 as much for 2-3 times the price with other brands.  This is why I don't trust it. Too good to be true.  I bought 3-4 of these as Christmas gifts but after trying the better stuff I cant go back to this.;negative
"For me ; this product did not work.";negative
"This coffee is not very good. I can get better tasting coffee from the grocery store for much less. It is not bad coffee, just nothing special about the taste. I did not notice any extra caffeine boost. After finishing this bag I tried the high caffeine Eight O'Clock coffee from my grocery store, which costs less money, tastes better, and has a noticeable caffeine kick. I usually drink my coffee black with MCT oil.

This Death Wish coffee is hard to handle because it is weirdly electrically charged. The ground beans fly everywhere and cling to every surface. It is a real mess to deal with. I cannot remember experiencing this phenomenon with other brands. Getting the ground coffee out of the grinder takes effort. I will never buy this brand again.";negative
"This product isn't sweet like sugar at all.  I rarely eat sweets so am sensitive to a sweet taste but this stuff isn't sweet at all.  I made two batches of ice cream, one with this, and one with real sugar and this stuff just doesn't even compare.  I had to add stevia, erythritol, and xylitol and play with the amounts to get it to taste like ice cream that had 3/4 C of real sugar.

This is over priced and ineffective.  I won't be using it again.";negative

Taste is of course a very individual thing, but I ordered these assuming it'd be just like Kikoman teriyaki sauce, but instead it was just horrible. The taste was just off, and I ended up pouring them down the drain.;negative
"Second Teasia product I ordered that has issues working with keurig 2.0 even though it says its keurig 2.0 compatible.  First batch of a different flavor took a few tries of opening the hatch to make it work.  I gave them the benefit of the doubt that maybe it was a faulty batch and after all they do work after a few tries.  Yet every other brand of tea or coffee works the first time with no issues ever.

This 2nd order of the variety pack has not worked at all.  I literally can not get even 1 of them to work for any of the flavors.  No matter how many times I try.

Every tea and coffee has worked that said it was 2.0 compatible except for this brand and I have tried dozens.";negative
"I purchased the High Protein Pretzels.  I've had Newman's Own Organic Pretzels before and they tasted great - but these are not good at all.  95% of the salt is at the bottom of the bag (have to have salt on pretzels!) and they have an overwhelming flavor of being burnt and not a good burnt either!  I have no use now for all these pretzels and i can't imagine anyone enjoying this taste!
It is upsetting to see that a few others also ended up with the High Protein pretzels having this awful BURNT flavor and yet they still kept sending them out.  I'd think maybe they'd look at batch numbers or something to prevent them from being shipped out to dissatisfied customers who will give it a bad review.
Generally Newman's Pretzels are really good, but buy these at your own risk....";negative
"The label says pumpkin and has a nice picture of a pumpkin. But I could detect NO PUMPKIN FLAVOR in the product whatsoever.  And I was really looking forward to it.

This tastes ok for a nursing tea, but it did nothing for my supply unfortunately. It also upset my stomache. I'm sure it works well for some women, but I wish I had bought just one box, because now I have tons of tea I can't drink.;negative
So I pretty much like all foods, but have four picky eaters, even I don't like these...we love multiple other brands of organic fruit strips/ ropes but no one likes these.  I do love that there is an organic apple in each one, but since no one will eat them, it's pointless.  I think it's the texture.  It's thicker and not sticky? The taste is ok...I guess it's just too different than what we are used to.;negative
"Makes great yogurt.  But this purchase (for a ""pack of three"") is a RIP-OFF!!!!  They charge twice the going rate and pretend that you get 3 boxes when in reality you only get ONE box 0f 6 starters = 3 linked pairs).  I hate this deception.";negative
The chive flavor wasn't as strong as I was hoping for and the texture was a bit strange to me, so I wouldn't order again.  It's not crunchy like a cracker, it's more crumbly and soft, which wasn't what I was expecting.  I ordered this flavor, as well as one other, and both are underwhelming for me.  Maybe if you eat only raw, this is a good alternative for you, but for me personally the texture is not enjoyable.  Price for the amount is a bit much, too.;negative
"Just received this 3-pack because I wanted to try the chocolate flavor.  Instead, I received ""Maca Chocolate"".  I should have known this might happen, since I was unable to find a single package of the chocolate (both on Amazon and other sites).  This is why I gave it 2 stars.  I should have returned it, but decided to try the Maca, and I am not impressed.  The dark French Roast is excellent, and I will continue to purchase it.  The flavors are ""meh"".  Be careful if you are ordering this 3-pack, unless you don't care what you receive.";negative
After reading many nice reviews, I was disappointed when I tried this honey for the first time.  It says raw, unfiltered honey but it looks like it's been filtered as it's cystral clear.  It also looks and tastes like it's been processed. It's has a thick syrupy feel to the tongue and I don't care for the taste.  I'm not suggesting the product has been misrepresented.  I'm just saying it doesn't look or taste like raw, unfiltered, unprocessed honey.  I had been using Nature Nate's Raw Unfiltered Honey but the price went up significantly so I decided to Desert Creek. I'll use this bottle for cooking but won't be purchasing any more.  There are a lot of good reviews here so I guess it's just a matter of preference.;negative
Way too sweet.;negative
The candy is so soft and melted that when you open the individual package you will not be able to eat it unless you scrape it with a knife (see attached picture).  Plus the candy was not in a package.  It was just put in an ordinary cardboard box as loose items but it fit well into the box.;negative

"I bought this since I seldom find a dark chocolate I really like.  Well, this one broke that record. It is really poor tasting..I wanted the small snack size packets, with nuts and berries...and free trade chocolate.  This is indeed that.
I highly recommend instead: The best chocolate by far is :
Equal Exchange Dark Chocolate Mini Bars 55% Cacao 0.15 oz (Pack Of 150)
November 26, 2012. It is rich and fruity tasting and leaves no bitter aftertaste.
And if you want instead Sugar Free?  The Coco Polo Stevia sweetened...is just fabulous with the Tart Cherries in it. I started with ordering the multi pack with the 70% Dark Chocolate, Ginger, Almond, Chocolate Nibs, but positively fell in love with the Tart Cherry bars.";negative
Too much heat, not enough flavor.;negative
Sad that I have to write a review less than 5 stars, but when you find dirt and sand in the calendula flowers that you use for tea, you have to make aware other buyers about this extra feature of this product.;negative
I ordered these because of the description, corn, quinoa and sesame.  However, all you taste is a popcorn cake, and not even a good one at that.  They are crispy yes, in that they break easily, but they are also very chewy and stick to your teeth.  There is no saltiness, not a hint of  sesame flavor, no flavor at all really.  They are so bland and boring, not really worth eating. I would have given them one star, but w/quinoa and sesame, I felt they had a little nutritional value, so that's something.  Very disappointed, and now I'm stuck w/ a life time supply.;negative
BUGS!  I purchased this item and let it sit unopened for a month before trying to use.  When I grabbed this curry powder to use it for the first time I found tiny dark brown bugs crawling in the powder.  I would NOT recommend buying this.  Stay away unless you don't mind extra LIVE protein in your curries!;negative
Not good for poppy tea!;negative
Disappointing - hardly any chocolate coating and it's not very good tasting either. The goji berries were rather too dry. I'm going to stick to the higher priced Nuts.com brand and bite the bullet and pay for their shipping. Won't be reordering these.;negative

To be fair to Amazon - I did call to complain, and they are sending me a replacement.  I'll update when I get the next package.

However - looking back - I seem to think I had the same issue ordering food stuff before from Amazon. I ordered some very high quality dark chocolate and that tasted kinda stale.";negative

Should have read other reviews more carefully. These figures are indeed tiny. Barely big enough for a cupcake. The quality is not very good (some of them will not stand on their own), and 12 for almost $20 is almost a rip-off.;negative
I must admit I like them, and they are a healthy alternative to a candy bar.  But at about $1.50 each for a very small light bar, they're too expensive for most.  Honey, nuts, and a few pieces of dried fruit shouldn't cost that much.  A competitor may come along hopefully with a better value.;negative
These made me sick. I have a sensitive digestive system and any slight bad anything in foods will turn my stomach. They had a pretty bad taste to me. Like very rotten bananas.  I had no idea these were from Guatemala I usually don't like to get foods from places like these. No offense but it's a tummy issue.;negative
"was trying to save a buck so checked to see if Amazon did canned meat; they do but I'll stick to Tyson's thank you; the stuff was almost tasteless and that was with a big glob of fat floating on the top; maybe I should have given it 1 star although the lack is Keystone's fault not Amazon's but I do expect Amazon to keep something this bad off their ""menu""";negative

These are very thin aluminum cans.  That's great for recycling, very bad for the storage of acidic juices, of which tomato juice is high on the list.

"It's such a shame that most of Amazon's food products are in minimum packaging (higher cost) as in this case of 6 bottles.  I was expecting a nice thick, slightly sweet peanut sauce for dipping chicken, satays, etc.  Instead there is only a VERY MILD peanut flavor but, even worse, there are lots of hot pepper bits throughout which gave me and my husband a fairly strong burn aftertaste.

At least we have a friend who likes hot, spicy, so we will give him all 6 bottles.";negative
This is DARK roast coffee.  I did not notice this before buying.  I do not like dark roast as the coffee seems burned and strong.  If you like Starbucks coffee then you will probably like this coffee.  I took one taste and dumped the entire pot out.  The smell is very strong which reminds me of a nasty cigar.;negative
These were SO stale I literally broke a tooth on the 3rd one- cracked the side right off a molar. The best part about it is I live in remote Alaska and was not able to access quick dental care so not only did this candy break my tooth but as a bonus I couldn't get it fixed for over an month. Thanks for nothing stupid valentine candy craving!!;negative
"I have been looking for a stevia flavored water enhancer that has a full flavor profile, is reasonably priced, does not require me to use two thirds of the product in one serving just to ensure it can be tasted, and doesn't have the bitter after taste that some stevia products have. Unfortunately, my purchase of the STUR Variety pack (Mango Orange, Strawberry and Lemonade) did not satisfy my needs.  It actually failed in EVERY CATEGORY that I listed above. The Stur Mango and Strawberry flavors was very disappointing as it took nearly 30 seconds of squeezing the product (they recommend 10 seconds) to get even close to a little sweetness, and even then the flavor was almost non existent.  The lemonade flavor was my favorite as after the 30 seconds of squeezing the lemon flavor was bolder and the sweetness was there for the most part - but because of the overall product size it seemed I would only have gotten 3-4 servings out of a bottle. Simply not woth the price.

I would strongly recommend purchasing Stevita or Krisda Field Berry Stevia drink mixes instead, with Stevita as the definite winner as it's very portable and the flavor stands alone by itself without me needing to add anything else, although I do prefer adding a little lemon juice and flavored seltzer water as a special treat.";negative
kind of too smooshy;negative
"These taste far more of the wheat than the sesame, and any honey flavor is superficial at best. They're just really bland, not at all like the sesame sticks and chips I'm used to getting from high-end snack companies. Not even as good as the sesame sticks in airline snack packs - and lets face it, those aren't exactly gourmet.
I had planned to return these, but the bag was unfortunately knocked into the floor. The unknowing individual threw them away, which was where they'd have gone anyway. Super disappointed in this purchase! Two stars only because I know a lot of people don't read or trust the single stars, but the only great thing about this bag of chips was that it was slightly less expensive than some other brands.";negative
Not so much;negative
I drink a lot of the lemon tea snapples out of the can, and got these thinking it would be about the same. The flavor isn't that far off, but it ends up having that powdery taste that I think most of these mixes run into. I also didn't like that I couldn't find any that weren't diet. Maybe Snapple is only putting out the diet mixes but still, I think maybe the splenda or whatever they use ruins the taste a bit as well.;negative
I have ever purchased! I can't believe any company would pack an acid based condiment in tin tube, it tasted like I was licking the inside of a tin can...worst of the worst!! I will be,asking/demanding my money back on this item(s) for sure!!!  ZERO STARS ON THIS CRAP!!!;negative

Sometimes I get a craving for Spaghetti with meat sauce and don't always have leftovers of my own sauce to satisfy that craving so I purchased this product. I was disappointed.

"OK. So im no anchovy expert, but the batch i just received 8-14-12 is more like anchovy paste. Im not sure why some people state on here that these aren't salty...are you kidding me?!!!! I guess im kinda strange in that i LOVE the super salty ""cheap"" anchovies most pizza places serve on their pizza...LOVE em !! These are just as salty, but minus some of the deep fishy flavor. Not firm at all...this is a large portion and you don't want to leave anything sitting in the tin for months at a time after you've opened it and placed it in the fridge (will leak toxins/metals into the food), so i dumped them into a glass container with a lid and the bottom half of the anchovies are paste. Even the ones on top that are not paste that look to have some form, are difficult to pick up because their consistency is that of overcooked/mush. Im disappointed. The soy oil flavor does not enhance the fish taste. I tried making caesar with this dressing and it is extremely fishy as it is impossible to mince, and turns into paste when whisking/mincing...dressing is a gwadaweful salty mess. Pass on these, my friends. Im going to Hawaii soon and considering using these for chum to attract fish !! These are either harvested at the wrong time of year, or the whole process they use is an unfortunate shortcut. Im sure there must be some culinary application for these, but im not sure what. I will likely try to be creative with the opened can, and use the other can for chum !!! Hopes dashed. The only reason why i didn't leave a one-star review is because of the amount you get for the $$, and the fact that im a sick bugger and still enjoy the flavor of this fishy mess, on some sick level, lol";negative

"I like the fact that Quaker put more fiber into this product than what is in their original oatmeal and that's the reason I bought it.  It tastes the same  as regular oatmeal, is quite easy to prepare in the microwave and the variety is quite nice.  I'd never had oatmeal with banana bread flavor previously so that was a welcome change.  I probably will buy it again because oatmeal is healthy, but to be perfectly honest, I prefer cold cereals.

Edit  November 21, 2014:  The Maple/Brown Sugar oatmeal was horrific as to the flavor which would not disappear from my brand new GE Monogram microwave even 24 hours after being prepared.  My entire kitchen smelled of maple which my neighbors noticed.  I called customer service and gave them all the relevant numbers on the cartons prior to my taking all four boxes out of my apartment and then using first a vinegar wash followed by some cut lemon, allspice berries and cloves in a water bath.

I believe this product is either a Jelly Belly knockoff, or an expired product that was repackaged by the vendor with an arbitrary expiration date.

I don't like to write negative reviews, but if I could give this less than a star I would. I'm very confused by all the positive comments. Despite the date showing it was good it seemed old.

Ordered these for my husband. He has a crazy love for Marmite, so I thought these would be a fun surprise. Unfortunately, they came smashed into a billion tiny bits. Obviously, that made them basically impossible to enjoy as crisps.;negative
"I wanted to give this product a try as the liquid honey crystallized in a few weeks during the winter months. This small 8 oz. packet does clump together a lot more than other sweeteners so there is less of an advantage over using honey in a jar and spooning out the crystallized honey.

I don't like it--its too dry, my stomach doesn't process it--I only use them in oatmeal , boiling for a couple of minutes in 5 minutes oats. I also don't like the taste, I will not reorder. It is not worth the price, the regular cranberry or raisins taste much better.;negative
Disgusting. I now have an entire box of tasteless noodles that I can't do anything with. I was highly disappointed in the lack of flavor and haven't been able to finish a single package. I will not be buying these again.;negative
I bought this and the angle hair version. I love the angle hair but this rice is disgusting. It completely liquified or mushed when I was rinsing it. I still cooked it and tried eating it but useless did nothing for the dish. Since I bought a few bags I tried it again, this time trying a gentle rinse, still mushed...I need up throwing the remaining bags away. I'll stick to the angle hair.;negative
Skip it.  As with all paleo versions of staples, I was prepared for some flavor and texture differences.  Still, Go Paleo hot cereal is just not great.  It doesn't swell and is soupy and heavily sweetened (for my taste).;negative
I bought this popcorn 3 months ago and have kept it in a large glass jar with a screw cap lid, i.e., airtight.  Tonight I took a scoop and set it on the counter and walked away for a moment, and black bugs started to crawl out of my scooped corn.  I looked into my clear glass jar and saw plenty more bugs.  Ick!!!  The corn tasted great when I bought it, but tonight I threw it all out...at least 2-1/2 to 3 pounds of unusable popcorn....and I am afraid to bring my jar back into the house.  Maybe the bugs could proliferate in my home!?  I am so disappointed at the money I spent and the little popcorn I enjoyed before it went buggy.  Too late to return it and get my money back....I have been cheated!!!;negative
"I wanted to find a flavor I'd like, and I enjoyed most of them--delicious tea, and I'm a long-time tea drinker.  HOWEVER, every time I had a cup of this tea, it raised my pulse rate astronomically.  I'm usually between 65-70 beats a minute, and with this, I was 98-110 every single time!  It didn't raise my blood pressure (I have a unit at home to check), only my pulse rate.  But I was very  uncomfortable and felt ill with the racing pulse.

That doesn't happen with the Tulsi I drink regularly, or any other tea--just this.

So although it's delicious, I can't risk this stuff.";negative
These were a waste of money. they did not give the water any flavor without using a lot. All of them had a off flavor. I gave them to my teen son and he liked them as sour punch candy. otherwise not a great product.;negative
Unfortunately, these particular snacks are just flavorless. I ordered them and the shipping was quick and simple, but the snacks themselves ended up in a post office food drive because I just couldn't see them going to waste on my pantry shelf. Sorry to say, I had hopes they'd be subtle and tasty, alas they are practically powdery and bland.;negative
"The product box looked like it was beat with a baseball bat, of the 4 packages only one was sealed the other three leaked flour everywhere.  The box my order came in was fine, ordered a bread machine and its box was great, But the box the flour came in sucked and the bobs red meal box was open at the top and bottom.  (Handling?)

Have ordered from bobs red mill and have been very happy with the products, but this one looked like it was beat up with a bat.  Manufactrues box blown out,, other boxes in great shape? Not much loss, so I repackaged the flour and yeast in the three broken packs.

Just sad it happened and the fine mess it made.";negative
The 1st shipment was of excellent quality - flavorful and the right consistancy. The 2nd shipment was tasteless and soupy as other reviewers mentioned. I can't believe that this stuff is American made. I removed 3 stars. I caught 3 rats with it out in the barn in just 3 attempts. 2 stars for the rats.;negative
"I'm another who was purchasing these for quite some time through the subscribe and save program.  It wasn't until I ended up keeping a bag longer than usual that I was finally able to determine where my moth infestation had come from.

This is the third time I have tried to write this review to warn people.  Each of the first two were just as polite but I included the pictures of the moth larvae and webs.  Neither review (apparently) was approved.  I'm trying again without pictures.

Frankly, I feel I'm owed recompense.  I've had to buy all sorts of moth control items and I've had clothes, towels, bedsheets and even the treated walls of my sound booth damaged by these moths.

Very disappointing.";negative
"----UPDATED 1/30/2014----
I previously gave this product 5 stars, but I recently ordered them again, and the product that I received was very, very different from what I received the first time I ordered it. The product I got this time came in a bag labeled ""We got Nuts."" The nuts tasted terrible. They are nothing like the former product that was represented by this product page. They are smaller, have less rice coating on them, and have a very chemical taste to them. There is no sweet taste to balance out the wasabi at all. Really, not good at all.";negative

"If you love cashews, this is the best choice as far as quality vs price. I have ordered it several times. There is very little broken pieces and the taste is perfect. BUT ONLY IF YOU BUY IT FROM CANDY MAX!!! I just ordered it again (August) from my orders area without realizing that although the same price and weight, it was not from the same source. This is a bad setup from Amazon. If from your order area you choose ""buy it again"" it should come from the same source. This purchase showed up from BAYSIDE CANDY. It was awful. Small mostly broken pieces. Never again will I trust Amazon and I will certainly not order from BAYSIDE CANDY.";negative

Pineapple Princess Passion fruit.
This particular blend needs to be renamed. . .

I suggest ""Really Reeks of Raisins"". . .

The first pitcher I brewed resulted in what is best described as Raisin Tea.

So, for the second pitcher, I took out nearly all of the raisins before brewing.

While the tea no longer tasted like raisins, I could not detect any hint of Pineapple,
despite seeing what appeared to be diced pineapple pieces in the steeper.

Either there was not enough pineapple in the blend,
or other flavors from the tea are overpowering it.

In summary, Raisin should replace Pineapple on the label. . .";negative
"I have changed my review from 5 stars to 1 star because Crown Prince changed their product from delicious to unacceptable.  Amazon really should clear out the old reviews as they make it look like this product is actually worth purchasing.  Crown Prince states that they could no longer get product from their Thai supplier and ""The only acceptable replacement product available was from China"".  Crown Prince - Your current product is not acceptable in taste or texture.  Worse, it is not acceptable to use China as a source of food, especially for a ""high end"" product such as this.  Don't believe me?  Google ""government and regulators struggle to ensure quality of that nation's exported food"" and read the article that states ""The misuse and overuse of hundreds of chemicals, many of them banned and toxic, have led to death for scores and sickness in hundreds of thousands of people throughout China."" and ""The problem affects not only China but also the United States and other countries that import Chinese-grown and processed food.""

Crown Prince - Find safer waters to harvest these clams from or just shut down production.

My 5 star review of the Thailand sourced clams is below:

I'm a big fan of Crown Prince smoked fish and these clams do not disappoint.  The can is filled with smallish clams packed in olive oil.  They have a very light flavor and are delicious.  Sodium is reasonably low (340 mg per package), while protein is high (16g - 32% recommended daily value) and iron is off the chart high (130%).  I like that they are wild caught.  Note - product comes from Thailand.";negative
Not to good.;negative
"I don't like the idea of eating meat so figured I'd give these a try.  The flavor options sounded nice.  Honestly the only ones I was able to eat were the Thai Peanut flavor.  With the others, the flavor couldn't compensate for the disgusting texture.  The seitan ones were WAY too salty, plus they seemed to separate into thin, stringy sheets when you bite into them.  They also don't hold together and fall apart to bits when removing them from the package.  Recommend scissors trying to get into these, because the tear notches don't work.  Anyway glad I got the variety pack instead of buying more of these, because they're a definite ""no reorder"" for me.  The Thai ones were ok, the rest... eww.";negative
If u want dark roast, this won't do;negative
This goes to show how different everybody's taste is.  I love licorice and decided to try this since Amazon happened to be out of stock of Good & Plenty, which is my all-time favorite.  I literally gagged when I put one of these in my mouth and started chewing.  TERRIBLE.  It tastes like a weird wad of chemicals.  I don't see how anybody can even swallow it let alone rave about how good it is..  Extremely disappointed and have crossed this one off my list forever.  It's going straight into the trash since I wouldn't even give it to a food shelter.  I didn't think it was that risky a purchase since Haribo has such a good reputation but I've got 5 Lbs. of inedible junk on my hands now.;negative
There were only two types of cookies in this double layered tin that I liked. And those were made of chocolate so rich that I couldn't eat all of those. I have a very sensitive stomach and can't eat just anything. I have never had problems with chocolate or any type of cookie before until now.;negative
I am on a quest for a dairy free chocolate.  Unfortunately this was not the dairy free chocolate that I was looking for.  It has a really granular texture, like sugar, that did not appeal to me.  The flavor was nice, but the texture was not smooth, velvety or creamy like I've found in other non-dairy brands.  :(;negative
I Buy these all the time and I just received these and the color doesnt look right. I just went to return them and it says I cant. Again, I purchase these a lot and know what they look like. They also didn't come in the bag they show in the picture and was loose in the bag the company sent it in. I feel a little ripped off.;negative
Maybe I'm just immune to it's effects, but the paltry 3 grams of protein in it doesn't do enough to curb my appetite. 20 minutes later, and it's effects are gone. Plus no matter how much you shake the contents in the bottle, if you set it down for more than a few minutes, it starts clumping up again.;negative
"Update:  PG Tips has changed its' quality and perhaps even the type of tea it uses.  This order is so disappointing!  There is NO FRAGRANCE AND NO FLAVOR.  In May I ordered the 'blue box' and it was not right either.  One of the reviewers said the white box was ok and these reviews seemed good.  I was really hoping for MY TEA!  I used to LOVE this tea.  What have they done???  I notice on the box there is nothing said about the type of lovely tea leaves they use; quality, etc....however, there is a side-long statement about 'sustainability'!  What a way to run a business...what about a side-long statement about QUALITY AND INGREDIENTS?!
I've switched to Barry's Tea Gold Blend Irelands finest tea since 1901 - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008US0MCA?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s01
Best wishes...
Original review:
PG TIPS is the Best Black Tea you can find - period!  We discovered this tea while visiting England.  PG Tips is the brand most English buy!  It has a nice wonderful and full bodied flavor.  We drink it hot or cold every day.  This seller is offering it for a great price.  Enjoy!  :)";negative
Just didn't like these at all !!;negative
I like most of the other KIND bars, but this one...well, after I ate it, I was thirsty for the rest of the day, which didn't happen when I ate other KIND bars. It might have been something in the spices. Also, there wasn't much ginger taste.;negative
I looked up on their website and it says this is medium roast.  Well whatever roast it is supposed to be, these beans are plain burned.  No matter how I doctor it it is undrinkable. Seller does not allow returns although nowhere is that stated.;negative
"Don't waste your money.  Trader Joes sells 100% pure organic Stevia extract powder for $10.00 and it truly is extremely sweet. A tiny spoon (maybe 1/8 tsp.)  comes with it and that equals the sweetness of over 1 tsp of sugar.
Sweetleaf says 1/8 tsp = 1 tsp. but I have used a tsp. to equal 1 tsp.  there is a lot of filler in this, its not 100% stevia.
Dont waste your money.  1st ingredient is vegetable fiber.";negative
came stale and nasty;negative
"It seems that no matter how I brew this, it comes out either very weak, or very bitter. I tried using a shorter steep time, and a lower temperature, but it seems like there's not really a good compromise between flavor and bitterness. The aroma itself is very overpowering and not too pleasant, unless it is brewed very weak.

If you're okay with weak tea, then I imagine this would be fine. I personally prefer other stronger, smoother, less bitter teas.";negative
"These were a big disappointment. They taste rather bland and provided zero energy increase of any kind.  Just to make sure it wasn't just me, I shared them around the office and everyone agreed. No one noticed any energy boost and all thought the taste was dry and bitter.
The company sent me an email asking my opinion. I provided them with the same info posted here and their response was, ""sorry but since are plant based results with vary"".
Unimpressed with that response as well.";negative
Lack luster with a hint of no flavor!  Really, there is only a hint of fragrance when you open the bottle of water but quickly disapates!  Very over priced...I could get this water from my faucet!  Very very disappointed.;negative
These are not good.;negative
The berries becoming very sticky and coagulate together, making it difficult to separate them into a usable portion and some of the berries acquired green spots on them.  I suspect this is all due to the sugar content, but that is speculation on my part.  (I keep about a two week supply in a glass container and I seal and freeze the remaining berries to attempt to preserve them);negative
"A snickers is a snickers, not much to say about it.
However, the expiration date is for three Months from now which tells me that these snickers have been sitting in the warehouse for many Months already.
When I bite into the snickers it is quite obvious that this candy is not fresh at all...(ex: the caramel is not chewy, the chocolate flakes off into pieces when I bite into it telling me it is stale, etc.)

I have been shopping on line for well over 10 years due to my being disabled, and I don't drive so I do almost all of my shopping on line, including, most of my food.
This has been the slowest shipping I've ever experienced with a seller...
So, let's see, I have very slow shipping from the seller, add to that the snickers are almost out of date and very stale, (in fact  I am going to toss them into the trash), I am left with a very terrible experience with this seller...what a rip....seller must be judeo/christian as money seems to be the bottom line!

So needless to say I'll never, ever use this seller again, I would rather go without!

Edit: problem is NOT with Amazon, I love shopping on Amazon, the problem is with D+J.
Amazon issued a refund for the stale candy....Amazon is the best!";negative
"While the seller is conscientious and I received the order promptly, I was grossly disappointed in the salsa.  Initially the product description sounded wonderful; I couldn't wait to try it. BUT when I opened the jar, the stuff had an off putting color (to say the least) and the consistency reminds one of vomit.  SORRY, but this is a zero.";negative
"""These are pretty good sized for tiny shrimp although they break up very easy if stirred hard. We use these in salads or we mix in mayo for shrimp sandwich. The price is pretty good and the taste is decent.""

Above was my original review, they have changed. The shrimp are now way smaller and less tasty. in fact I think they are nasty compared to the ones they were sending out. I had an old can to compare them to. Who do they think they are fooling? They smell like cat food now.";negative
I wish I could have written a good review, but .... I am just anxious to get through them all at this point.  The flavors are good, they are exactly as stated.  It is the TEXTURE I do not like.  First of all, they have the appearance of rabbit food pellets.  I can get past that, but the texture is what I cannot get past, and YOU HAVE TO REMOVE WITH THEIR PAPER PROVIDED IN THE BOX OR A TISSUE OF SOME SORT.  DO NOT TRY AND SPIT THIS OUT OR GRAB IT WITH YOUR FINGERS.  It will stick to your fingers and anything it comes in contact with, make no bones about it- it will stick!;negative
I should have paid attention to a review that described the product as just sweet with no real citron flavour.  I use it and lemon peel when making fruit bread in my bread maker.  I will use up what I have but not buy more.;negative
This is not a complaint about your product but the box it came in was damaged and the powder was spread around the other products and the inside of the box. I have ordered this several times and always been extremely happy with it.;negative
This stuff tastes awesome!  I love it at BW3s.  HOWEVER do NOT order it from Amazon!  It's 3x more expensive than buying it at the restaurant...I ordered before I knew they sold it at BW3s.  It also made myself and my fiance sick for 2-3 days after eating it.  Love Amazon but will be very hesitant and do my research before ordering similar items!;negative
I couldn't even finish the first cup. I mixed it in a blender with almond milk. The chocolate flavor is very weak, nonexistent while the artificial sweetener taste is very, very strong. So strong, it felt like I was drinking chemicals. Adding a banana didn't help. I couldn't bear it and had to throw it down the drain then drink a bunch of water to get rid of the foul chemical taste left in my mouth. I'm gonna avoid this brand altogether from now on.;negative
Just not as good as Amoretti;negative
"If it says it's a paste, it should be a paste, not a thick syrup.  You can't pour a paste, but you can pour this.

I used this tonight for the first time in whipping heavy creme.  Basically it took twice as much volume to get the vanilla taste as it does when using vanilla extract.  There is nothing concentrated about it.  I'll give it two stars for having okay flavor, but no more than that because it isn't what they claim it to be.

The only thing I can come up with is that most of the negative reviews have been in the last month.  Are they having a production problem?  Switched suppliers?  I don't know, but it's not worth coming back nor the price for what I got today.";negative
"Way too much sugar, almost 50 grams per can which is insane.  No real ginger in the mix just ""ginger flavor"" whatever that is.  Other ginger beers I have list actual ginger as an ingredient.  Check out Fever-Tree Premium Ginger Beer it is far superior in my opinion.";negative
Nasty!!!;negative
Sorry .. don't like the taste.;negative
I'm wondering if I got a bad batch or something... this seriously tasted like moth balls mixed with burnt rubber and a tiny bit of coconut... seriously I have no idea.  I am usually not picky with teas and this made me sick to my stomach i couldn't take more than 2 sips.  I make another cup and it was the same story... now i have a pound of the stuff. Blast;negative
I hate deceptive advertising.  They state this is Ceremonial Japanese Matcha Tea when in fact it is produced in China and is not ceremonial.  Shame on Amazon for allowing this type advertising in the portfolio of sellers.;negative
"Maybe only for purpose of loosing only. It is not normal pasta taste at all, the smell is not a problem after you do things said on the package. It goes away in no time, this is not a problem, but what is the problem is the taste of it. No matter if I did everything on the package, it tastes as it was just undercooked. If I cook it as some reviewers suggested, longer and with sauce and things, I get something saucy that's all. So taste of the noodle IS the taste of the sauce then.
Well, it tastes weird as undercooked or has no taste. Too much hassle to make it bearable as a result. Not my cup of tea :)";negative
I love Haribo Gold Bears and the Rolls of the disks, but the consistency of the Haribo Gummi Pink Grapefruit is very strange.  It is similar to the sugared sliced fruit, but with hard pieces throughout.  Some people love the sliced fruit candies, my husband does, but not me.  Hopefully my husband will like these otherwise they will go to waste.;negative
Price varies from a deal to a terrible idea. Had this on subscribe and it was low low low until time to ship (repeatedly not just once) then it sky rocketed. The product tastes fine my son likes it. Took it off my order bc I don't like being manipulated;negative
"update - 2014-12-20

the new price - $24 + $7 shipping instead of $14 with free prime shipping - makes this a very bad deal.

new rating is a TWO since the price is now insanely high. [*sigh ...*]

howdy y'all,

this is a rather fine, quick meal. i prefer it with sliced, grilled sausage and chuncked chicken breast added, but it is enjoyable on its own. quick to cook, easy to cook ... and it tastes good! [*grin*]

rated a FOUR since it does all that i expected _plus_ it tastes better than expected.

take care,

Great texture but terrible taste. My partner and I could not eat more than a couple of spoonfuls. It doesn't taste like chocolate. Eh, maybe we can blend the rest into a shake with chocolate, yogurt a/o fruits. ?;negative
"...to read ingredients before I order? Yes, it's my fault. If I'd read the ingredients list, I would have spotted it, fourth one from the top: Sugar, roasted peanuts, corn syrup, HYDROGENATED PALM KERNAL....

This is easily the single most harmful ingredient modern food and snack companies are cramming into our candy and baked goods. For years, we've been warned by consumer groups to read the ingredients list and avoid anything with an ingredient beginning with hydro.... The human body isn't capable of processing hydrogenated foods. As one consumer group noted: When hydrogenated oil is made, these healthy fats are converted into a new type of fatty acid, known as a trans fat. Trans fats are not at all good for one's health. It adds, Consumption of hydrogenated oil has been linked with diabetes, coronary disease, and obesity in a wide number of scientific studies. Okay, candy makes one fat. No surprise there. But many candy manufacturers make wonderful candy products without hydrogenated oils. Snickers, for example. The hydrogenated oils are denser, and melt at higher temperatures, which means the bodies can't break them down and process them like other oils. And as someone who's loved Baby Ruth candy bars since childhood, the current candy just isn't as good. Not only are modern candies made with genetically modified foods, they're made with high fructose corn syrup, which cuts more corners and means the candy doesn't taste as good as you remember it. (It's why Coca-Cola isn't as good.) So find out what you're eating before you buy it. These are going into the trash. Hopefully candy makers will stop making this stuff with hydrogenated oils. Fructose we'll have to live with (at least until it's formally linked with Alzheimer's), but I'm going to go with Krackle bars from now on!";negative
This might be good for children, but I was shocked at how tiny they are! Also, there was only a dot of peanut butter. Tiny dot! The two layers were not lined up either, like in the picture. I prefer Nairn's Oat Graham's. Will never buy again.;negative
not good at all;negative
"These cookies are not of the quality I have come to expect with Pamela's Products.  In addition, there are only 9 cookies per box.

I regularly use the bread and flour packages that Pamela's Products produces and highly recommend them.  These cookies fall short of quality.

If you need to be gluten free, and in desperate need of a cookie only then would I recommend these.";negative
These were drier than others I've had and the sugar from the figs were crystallized on the outside.  I really don't mind that at all and actually liked it that way.  The complaint I have is that they tasted fermented which makes me think that they were sitting around for awhile and not very fresh.  I ate many of them and didn't get sick--or drunk!--but I don't think I will be buying them again.  I threw away the rest because they were tasting more fermented daily.  Yes, I kept them in the refrigerator after opening.  I thought I had bought them before from this seller and loved them.  Maybe it was another brand and I mistakenly ordered these or maybe it is the same seller and I got a bad batch.  I'll have to check on that.;negative
I thought I was buying pure coconut syrup, not HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP, which is the main ingredient. I feel cheated. I have thrown it out. Shame on Hawaiian Sun Products for their deceit. I won't be buying any more of their products.;negative
"we LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the ""old"" green tea with lemongrass.

This new stuff is tooo sweet;  too flowery.  completely terrible.  I bought 6 boxes and only used 3 bags from one box.  will have to toss the rest.

we hate this new formula.";negative
"I'll start by saying ""they taste just fine"". They really do. Here comes the ""However""...

They taste just fine. However, I have opened 5 boxes so far and all of them have cracked pop-tarts! They aren't in pieces, but it only takes a bump to make them that way. There are cracks running through them, weakening the structure. Now imagine putting these cracked pop-tarts into the toaster... Now imagine trying to carefully remove these cracked - and now very hot - pop-tarts FROM the toaster. It almost isn't worth the effort. I have had to flip my toaster over the trashcan every day since I got these pop-tarts.

I thought about contacting Amazon for a refund or replacement or whatever, but I figured Amazon would blame UPS, UPS would blame the Amazon warehouse, the Amazon warehouse would blame Kellogg's, Kellogg's would blame Amazon, and I would end up getting dental work done from gritting my teeth in frustration.

I would not recommend buying pop-tarts from Amazon. Just go to the grocery and buy them. Your toaster will thank you.";negative
"Original: There is nothing close to this for me, this is the best of this brand.  I could not get myself to consume any other product out there, even before i found this.  Now i am eating a pound a week.  The texture and flavor are both exactly how i perceieve traditional jerky to be.

Edit: I knew there was a high fat content in this product which is just not something that should ever be apparent in a dried beef product since fat doesn't cure/dry and just spoils rapidly.  But it was minimal and I accepted the occasional bag that was worse than others.  This last batch I bought had so much fat that after I placed the bag in the fridge, the sides of the bag looked like they had donut icing caked on them.  There is more fat in this product than the cooked bacon I make and store in a bag.

Anyone who has tasted rancid beef fat would agree it's not something you want in your product.  They need to revert to the industry standard ""lean cut"" only tradition that has worked for hundreds of years, otherwise I can't enjoy People's Choice products further.";negative
"I really don't like this stuff.  It smells okay, but there is almost no almond flavor to speak of.  I don't particularly have strong feelings about avoiding the tiny amount of alcohol in normal extracts, so I don't really understand what the benefit of this glycerin-based version is.  If you taste a drop of this, it's sweet, but not very almond-y.  In that regard, it sort of reminds me of Torani syrups.

I would definitely not repurchase this, and would not recommend this to anyone in search of true, robust almond flavor.";negative
Ordered a bunch of staples using Amazons subscription stuff. The day it was to be delivered it showed up as 'Undeliverable' and was shipped back to Amazon. Everything else in the order were metal or plastic containers- this is the only thing that could have done it. Now I have to go out and buy what was supposed to come in person, at greater cost to myself. Stay away from this garbage.;negative
what a crap;negative
"These must have been old, and maybe stored too warm.  The chocolate is tan and powdery.  The flavor is very light.  Each person in my office at 1 piece, and said it was bad.  So I have taken them home, maybe I can cook with them.

I also bought the ""sea salt"" version of these; the sea salt diamonds came fresh and tasted good, the box was eaten by coworkers.  Very popular.";negative
Although the picture of this product seems to show many pecan halves, the product was small broken pieces.  When I soaked them overnight in salt water and slow/low-heat dried/roasted them, even that could not hide that they were old... had probably been in the package/warehouse much too long... certainly not the current season of harvest.  THEY WERE RANCID AND DISCUSTING TO THE TASTE AND TO MY STOMACH.  THIS PRODUCT SHOULD NOT BE SO MISHANDLED.;negative
No taste. Not even a little bit.;negative
Really loved the sauce, but not the plastic bottle.  You can see when you finish the sauce how it has changed the color of the bottle.  How much plastic must leach into the hot sauce?  If you care about your health, find a different hot sauce to love.  One that comes in a glass bottle.;negative
Great for those who like any kind of juice, or paying cranberry prices for grape juice.  The Ocean Spray company carefully shields potential customers from the ingredients list. In order: grape juice, apple juice, cranberry juice (third!), raspberry juice.;negative
TOO MUCH SOLT;negative
"I have used this product in the past, and it was very, very sweet--as stevia is supposed to be--and didn't have an unpleasant aftertaste. My husband wanted an all-natural sweetener and I recommended Sweet Drops based on my past experience with it, and told him to be sure to use less stevia than Sucralose.  Well, did we get an unwelcome surprise--the bottle labeled ""Sweet Drops"" is like lightly sweetened water!  He'd been using 2 drops of Sucralose, so he tried one drop of Sweet Drops. No difference. Tried another drop. Eventually he put 4 drops in his coffee and all he got was an aftertaste and the slightest hint of sweetness. I tried it and used TEN drops--barely a nuance of sweetness. I finally added one drop of sucralose to make it palatable.

So I have to ask--has SweetLeaf changed their formula so much that it's no longer useful?  Or did I get a bottle from a bad batch where the manufacturers added too much water (WAAAYYY too much water)? I was honestly shocked that SweetLeaf would sell something so useless, after I had used it, and even a couple of their flavored versions, and found them very good. This bottle, however, was a waste of money and I'll never recommend it again if this is the new norm.";negative
What happened?  Did they change the recipe?  Is there an evil genie making these now.  I was a devoted addict to Gustaf's, but this order seals what I thought on the last one.  They have changed.........and not for the better.  Use the old formula, it is infinitely more delectable!;negative
"I purchased this to use for chocolate making as I do not use sugar.

I stirred it in as I melted the cocoa butter but I could feel the graininess at the bottom all the time. I kept hoping it would incorporate. There is nothing else ""grainy"" in the recipe. I just unmolded the chocolates and at least it is not grainy throughout, but the bottoms definitely are. I only used about a quarter cup (and some stevia which I KNOW dissolves well as I have used the same brand for years and only used one packet) into a cup of cocoa butter and a cup of coconut oil (plus cocoa and flavorings--but added those at the end.

This was a waste of money as I do not envision using this product in anything else, especially since it is so grainy.";negative

"I like V-8 juice. I love blueberries.  I love pomegranate.  I hated this juice.  Hate is not a word I use often, so when I say that I hated it; I mean, I really, really didn't like it all.  Sorry to anyone who might like this, but it seriously is nasty stuff! I ended up pouring the entire bottle (less one swallow) down the drain... while I was rinsing my mouth out.  The taste still lingered so I chewed gum... then I added an altoid trying to get the horrible taste out of my mouth.  Though it has been days, the memory is still so vivid I am going to have to go brush my teeth now after just typing about it.";negative
These candy bars were NOT refrigerated well. There was NO insulation around inner box and if any refrigerant was used, it was very little because there was very little room for it. The refrigerant, if any, had to be dry ice that evaporated during shipping. I had to throw them away, eating a single bar made me sick. I've purchased this same item from other distributors, where it was well insulated with cooling packs included and was received in excellent condition. Not these!;negative
Pretty awful.  Strange tasting, very acidic.  I have to admit, the only reason I purchased this was because it was cheaper than the others.  Usually I doctor store-bought bbq sauce to suit me, but with Hunt's there really was nothing I could do to make it better.  It didn't even taste like barbecue sauce to me.  Throwing all 3 bottles away that I purchased.;negative
It's flavor is too strong for me.;negative
Doesn't taste nor look like the ones I'm used to buying at the store. The other day I also chewed on a piece of GLASS found inside my vans cereal box purchased on Amazon. My mouth is still cut! Beware of buying food here I don't think i will do it anymore 3 strikes you're out!;negative
Gross. Definetly  not my cup of coffee. Was hoping for more pumpkin flavor, but it tasted too much like coffee. Its perfect if you want a little flavor with your coffee. But I actually don't like the flavor of coffee at all, but do like the caffeine;negative
I was very disappointed with this purchase.  There were just different strengths of coffee, with a few hazelnut cups thrown in.  I don't like flavored coffee anyway, but now I have to spend more money & time to find it for my guests.;negative
I love nearly all ginger mints and ginger chews, or anything ginger for that matter but these are by far one of the most disgusting things I've ever eaten.  The have a very strong taste of artificial sweetener and are just bitter and gross.;negative

"Did not suit me at all. I was terribly disappointed after reading all the positive reviews. I was looking forward to its arrival and tried it the next morning. It was so bad that I couldn't drink it. What came to mind with my first sip was ""dirty dish water"" - ugh! I've not drunk dirty dish water so I don't know where that thought came from but it seems like an accurate description. It was weak and yucky. Maybe it didn't work in my Keurig machine. They were odd looking pods with a small amount of coffee inside in a pouch.";negative
"Peanut butter Cookies:  Yeach.  the pecan shortbread cookies are so wonderful and these had 5 stars beside them, so I ordered a case.  nobody will eat them-- they're rubbery.  I'm surprised because most of Pamela's products are so tasty.

Chocolate Chunk Pecan Shortbread:  These are WONDERFUL, gluten free cookies.  The only problem is, and it's a BIG PROBLEM, that they were shipped in a tiny, tight box and so they were all in crumbles by the time they arrived!  Had Amazon packed them in a larger box and used bubble wrap OR the plastic air bags they often package with, the cookies would likely not have crumbled.  So disappointed, because these are GOOD COOKIES.";negative
Good product, bad price;negative
I thought this was great...at first...and then the bloating and stomach distress and ugliness that follows came at me like a freight train.  I had no idea that Stevia could cause such problems.  I am back to drinking plain, filtered water.  I tossed the remaining bottles.;negative

Hard to find one that has a decent fruity taste.  The orange mango I had to spill it out it was horrible.  If you use too little you can't taste it and if you use too much it's over powering and tasted like chemicals.  For the cost I feel ripped off.;negative
"I bought this coffee based on reviews and my experience with another bag of coffee from this company, which was great. I love darker roast coffees, and have drunk many varieties, from high end stuff to mid-range (e.g. Eight O'clock) and have enjoyed pretty much all of them. I really wanted to like this, but it is hands down the worst french roast I have ever tasted. It is very bitter. Both bags, too, although the second is not quite as bad as the first. Maybe I just got a bad batch, but it's really terrible.

The only way I can drink this is to grind it with cardamom and make something close to Turkish coffee- this seems to reduce the bitterness. Needless to say, I won't be ordering it again.";negative
Not really a fan of Bob's anymore after I got sick from the sorghum flour that was cross contaminated and they did nothing about it. The potato flour is ok, there are much better brands out there than this one and they are truly prepared in a safe manner. sorry Bob;negative
Yuck.  The ingredients list Ammonium Chloride, which is used in fertilizers. I enjoy a salty licorice, but this stuff had a horrible urine side to it.

Not. Good. At. All.;negative

I ordered a 5lb bag, thinking they would be as good as other companies I've ordered smaller amounts from, but I was wrong. It arrived in a non-resealable plastic bag. Not a big deal and the full 5lbs was there. I divided them up into smaller sealed containers. However, the taste is far inferior to others I have ordered. They are very bland, yellow, and a little stale. Next time I will pay a little more for smaller bags from other companies for a better product.;negative
YUCK!!;negative
So wanted to like this.  The ice cream was chock full of shortbread and completely missing the tangerine.  Even the vanilla was impossible to taste.  It was just bland ice cream with lots of mushy shortbread.  Great concept but Haagen-Dazs needs to fix the ratio of components.  Very very disappointing.;negative

As a dedicated Starbucks robust brew fan, I don't know why I decided to give this a try - I guess it was price.  Well.you get what you pay for - and this coffee tasted like dishwater compared to Starbucks, Peets - almost any dark roast I like.  Will stick to Starbucks or Peets.;negative
"I so hopped this was going to be good.
very bland, so bland salt and pepper don't help
the noodl;es I have to say are pretty good texture wise. Not sure how they made them stay solid after being in a can so long.

for us, the taste was just horrible tho, but at least Its safe for me to eat with celiac";negative
I had my mouth all set to enjoy these, opened the package and they smelled like red vines, they do not, however, taste like red vines.  They aren't fresh and the texture has a strange harshness to it.  This is unlike any red licorice I have ever tasted.  I bought one for my family and one for my brother's.  Now I don't want to even give them to him so it's 2x's a waste.;negative
I LOVE ROCA but this is very disappointing - i should have read further to see why all the one-star reviews - all of the pieces are mangled and melted so the wrapper foil is imbedded into the chocolate almost impossible to remove without a mess. Once unwrapped however it tastes fine.;negative
It's probably a matter of taste, but this tastes weak and watery. I bought a different brand at the grocery story, and it was much better, although,to  be fair, the grocery store kind had twice as many calories.;negative
"I love mocha, but these were awful. First, they were bite size instead of substantial - which is fine, considering it's a sampler box.

My biggest problem was what is shown on the box compared to what is inside. On the outside, they show strawberry, lemon and green tea. Inside, it's red bean paste, peanut, sesame, chestnut and fruit (not any fruit in particular - just fruit).

Both boxes were exactly the same. And they weren't particularly tasty. They were just bland. There are much better examples of mochi available on Amazon. Go for those before you choose these.";negative
Does not taste good at all.;negative
Imagine the  weakest, most stale  coffee you've had in some dinner where nothing was good but it was all really, really cheap compared to everything else so people keep going and convincing themselves it wasn't that bad. Now put that in a nespresso compatible capsule.;negative
"I'm not sure why ""Palm Kernel Oil"" is not considered a nut but it's in this product and I wasted my money on an entire case. If you can't eat tree nuts, including coconut, then palm kernel oil might cause you an allergic reaction too.";negative
Love the salt & pepper taste and this brand used to be good but the last 3 bags have been 15-20% empty shells with no kernels. I suppose that explains the low price but it's disappointing that the quality control on this brand has suffered so much recently.;negative
It'll take us a while to use up this box as it turned out neither of us liked the cheese flavor packet stuff very much. It's tempting to just write it off, eat only the noodles with some butter and pepper, and throw the cheese packets away.;negative
Non-returnable;negative
"No discernible caffeine even with double doses and it smells like grass so it seems pretty low quality. The bag also lists it as both Culinary grade and Ceremonial grade. It doesn't fully dissolve even when whisked but no lumps; just a bit grainy when used as tea. Tastes like green tea so I'm giving it 2 stars for that.";negative
Instant coffee tastes bad. Tastes real bad - like burnt dirt mixed with dried compost. I bought this thinking I could mask the bad flavoring to make quick frozen coffee, but no, that is an impossible task. I know that now. OTOH, if you're a caffeine junkie but have children (where you wouldn't ever want to keep actual pure caffeine), this is a reasonable idea for when you don't have time to brew proper coffee but also don't want to pay the high prices at cafes or for caffeinated squirt containers. It's also a great way to kick the habit, or at least slow down.;negative
it has 90% sunflower seeds.;negative
This was my own fault for not reading the small print but just to save someone else my fate - these are the smallest of boxes not the movie-size boxes! I can get this product in the movie-size for $1.00 locally. This small box cost me almost doouble that. Lesson learned.;negative
"From the description and reviews, I was really looking forward to eating this cake and I also ordered the banana rum cake.

The only way to tell these cakes apart was this one had some coconut sprinkled on half the top.  Both were too ""rummy""...rum overpowered the taste of everything else to the point that it was distasteful.

I had hoped to order some more rum cakes to serve to guests or use as a ""hostess"" gift.  Am I glad I got this for a taste-test...I would have been very embarrassed!!";negative
"I wasn't happy with my purchase. I knew going in spending $20 on 30-count wasn't going to get me exactly what I wanted, however I did expect a bit more

As my title says, I wasn't too thrilled with the selections of flavors. First of all there were very few plain coffee - I think 4 total. The rest are flavored coffee/cappuccinos, a few tea pods. The majority is cocoa of the flavored ciders. It's like buying mixed nuts and getting mostly peanuts, a few almonds, cashews, etc.

Very disappointed. Everything looked like someone just scooped up a bunch of random pods with no rhyme or reason to the choices - the only similarity to the cocoa and flavored ciders was the looked like all the fall flavors like cinnamon apple, pumpkin spice.

The cocoas, what little coffees there were, the other stuff were okay tasting.

FOLLOW UP - the Happy Meadow cappuccinos do NOT fit the Hamilton Beach models single-serve makers

Change ""I probably won't buy these again - I would say there a 99% chance I won't"" to ""I definitely won't buy these again"" Nor will I buy any with the Happy Meadows brand.";negative
"I usually only drink a half a can at a time and I feel AWAKE and energetic without feeling the caffeine buzz.  I exercise in the evenings and this really helps.  I have never felt overstimulated or experienced an energy crash of any kind.  Good stuff!

Updated to add that they have changed the product as of 7/2017 and I hate the new flavor.";negative
This coffee isn't better than brewed coffee, and not better than any other instant coffee. I was really disappointed. It has a different flavor, but not a better flavor. Of course, anything can taste good if one adds a lot of sugar to it. The real test of a good coffee is if it tastes good without sugar. This coffee fails that test.;negative
"Wow THIS WAS TERRIBLE!  The fettuccini ""noodles"" fell apart to mush.  Consistency of overcooked cabbage.  It happened immediately as I rinsed them in a colander.  GROSS.  Pasta Zero I found in Wallmart was WAY better.  Only 30 cals for a package.";negative
didn't work;negative
I bought this green tea from Amazon because of strong reviews. I have tried it twice on two different days, steeped according to directions on the bag the first time and then steeped for 15 minutes the second time. I have to say I hate this tea! Very grassy in flavor and watered-down for what's left over! I am a long-time tea drinker and occasionally buy more expensive loose-leaf green tea from Japan. This Kirkland Matcha blend is NOT high quality green tea. I am giving this tea two stars instead of one because I can understand how people who do not know how to brew tea can complain about its bitter tannic taste. I also give credit to Kirkland for putting more volume of tea in the bags. With this tea, it will never be bitter because the flavor is completely weak! If you've tried something like Bigelow Green tea and hated its bitter taste, you might think this Kirkland Matcha tea is the top of the line. But it is not! First, the Bigelow will never be sweet like authentic loose leaf green tea because it was not dried and packaged correctly. Second, brewing it for longer than 4 minutes will make it dark yellow and bitter. But this Kirkland brand is much worse because it only looks green like the authentic green tea, yet tastes nothing like it! I continue my search for a convenient high-quality green tea and will resort to Bigelow for quick fixes if I can't find anything satisfying in the meantime...;negative
I don't think they were bad or spoiled, but I just didn't like the flavor of these. Nativa brand tastes a lot better. They were so bad that I tossed them. I tried roasting some, but I didn't have much luck with that, either.;negative
I can't give this a hate, because I got the wrong Donut Shop flavor from this vendor.  I didn't get to the box till now, since I purchased about 200 k-cups total and there were only 20 of these.  If I had the box to send them back in I would if I could.  I don't like the flavor as much as other brands either.  The regular non bold is just plain.  K-cups are great, and these work, but wrong flavor, so I can't say much more.;negative
There's a reason the price was so low, these don't taste anything like I'd expected. They're stale and dry and almost tasteless. Even when I was starving I couldn't bear the taste and texture, and I love roasted chestnuts.;negative
I bought it to make ice cream.  I haven't try it yet (the beans are vacuum-sealed), however, the picture is misleading, the beans are moist and about half the circumference of a yellow #2 pencil.  A little disappointing looking, but who knows, it may be a great buy.;negative

Definitely not worth the expense!

It's only redeeming quality was that I seasoned it to bread oven fried pork chops.

"Strangest thing how something that is supposed to be good for you has all kinds of vegetable gums listed on the label. I guess people who drink this stuff are candidates for enemas, which is one of those growth industries in California. Do you want an enema? Oh right, there is inulin and other not-quite-fiber added to help out with the drain clog process. Do you think their added ""fiber"" makes a difference? I don't.

And, when did the FDA allow food processors to use the highhanded and totally consumer-enemy term ""Natural Flavors"". I guess that is more informative than, say, ""Unnatural Flavors"", or even ""Abnormal Flavors"". Hmm, I think I'll go with ""Abnormal Flavors"", because that is what it tastes like.

If you like the taste, you'll like the taste. Some products tell you that a man will turn into a woman from ingesting soy protein. This product eliminates all that and cuts to the chase by putting ""Hello, beautiful"" on the front. Well, fact is, I am a good-looking man, and I don't care what nonsense they put on these packages.

It's the stevia ingredient that leaves that bitter aftertaste, as the other customer pointed out, but it tastes like sucralose. Tell you what, live a little. Put some sugar in to taste. Much, much better that way.";negative
I LOVE the Quaker Oats Instant cups, so I thought that I would give this variation a shot. Unfortunately, I purchased a whole 12-count box of them and I very wish I hadn't. The oatmeal is crunchy and the blueberries are gummy and gross. Even my 2-year-old who will eat ANYTHING hates this and pushed it away at breakfast. I won't be purchasing these again.;negative

"First let me say that I did purchased this from the Amazon option, the pictured product, EQUALis not what you will receive, you will get a sweetener called ""Sweet Mate"" which sells at the 99 cent stores. This is a cheaper product made with different quemicals and ingredients than Equal. I informed Amazon and I still can't believe they haven't removed or change this product. Another reviewer says that the product is made by EQUAL, not true,it is just distributed by a vendor that also distribute Equal. This do not taste like EQUAL at all.  Amazon wanted me to reorder it to see if I got a different one again, even after telling them that all feedbacks said they received a different product than the one listed. Doesn't make sense at all, how many people ned to receive the wrong product for them to do something about it? I love Amazon but this is a big disappointment.";negative
"I've ate many different brands of refried beans and none tasted as bad a this. I don't think anyone could eat these.

The worst thing is that this product can not be returned I just found out. So I'm out 12 cans worth.

All I can do is warn others. Very dry and tastes funny. I tried doctoring it up with no results.";negative
way too much salt;negative
I've ordered these before from sellers in the UK and loved them. This time, the seller was listed as Amazon LLC. I don't know what's wrong with them. They aren't expired, but they're hard and don't flake apart like they're supposed to. They look a bit darker than the ones I got before. The taste was off too. It had a weird tang to the usually mellow chocolate. I ate a couple bites and put it down. Not sure if it's a storage problem on Amazon's part or what, but you can definitely get a bad box of these from this listing. I'm reviewing because I saw a few people say they had similar experiences. However, Amazon customer service is fantastic and did issue a refund.;negative
they're ok - just ok...;negative
Has wheat!;negative
Used to be great when it was only grapefruit as the 'forward' flavor.  Now, since they changed the design on the cans, and I'm guessing the recipe, there is a nasty coconut flavor.  I love coconut- sweetened, unsweetened, in candy, in savory dishes, eating the toasted coconut chips, etc.... but this tastes like soap.  I'm bummed-  first had the new flavor in a variety pack.  At least some of the 12-pack was usable.  The blood orange stained my drinking glass, so that got dumped as well as the coco-grapefruit.  Would be nice to know that the recipe had changed, so I could have NOT WASTED money on a variety pack.  I e-mailed the customer service folks as I was told to after a message on FB to Bai.  Got some blank e-mail in return,  and nothing else.  I've been drinking Bai and Bai Bubbles for over  a year.  I know to avoid their other coconut products- but love most of the other flavors.  It would have been nice to hear back from the customer service folks.  At least to know if there is a permanent recipe change- or someone didn't since the pipes between flavors.  :(;negative
"This green tea is the worst I have purchased. I don't understand the good reviews. This has a smoke taste. It is not smooth or light at all. Lipton original green tea tastes better than this.

Don't waste your money on this product, I have 5 boxes that will be tossed out.

1. Bigelow Organic
2. Celestial Seasonings Organic

Very strong seaweed taste, and they sent me a different mold than the one pictured.  It was 2 little molds connected together.  It still works--but I wanted the single mold that was pictured.  I didn't try to fix it--they probably would have--just didn't bother.;negative
"I love white tea and have had white peach tea in the past and liked it. I also love Ginger. But this tea has ""Other Natural Flavors"" in it that I do not like. It has a strong  licorice root,taste , which I hate. So this tea is not for me.";negative
"---Update 03-18-17---
They changed it, cheapened it, weakened it, ruined it. Now it tastes terrible. They have betrayed their loyal customers. I don't plan on EVER buying this brand again.

"Before you read this, I highly recommend Just the Cheese's mini rounds in the same flavor.  I DO NOT recommend these bars.  If I could have given them zero stars, I would have.

I thought these would be great.. I love Jalapeno, and I love cheese.. what could go wrong?  These bars could and did!  They are extremely hard to bite into.  I worried about cracking my teeth on them.  They taste like jalapeno flavored salt blocks.

I gave them to a friend of mine who eats anything and everything (Mikey Jr!).  He didn't like these either.  He's going to try breaking them up (I assume with a hammer) and put them in his next batch of chili.  I wish him good luck. I suggested that he use them for repelling pests in his garden.

I wrote the company, and they sent me some samples of the mini rounds.  I was skeptical, but they are GREAT!  I'll order those next time.. they are not too salty, just the right amount of crunch, and taste great.  They have 5 or 6 flavors and I like them all.";negative

I bought these because of the fabulous reviews.  I was looking for a low-carb chocolate bar option and ordered two different types of bars.  I am not wild about the taste, however.  I still have most of the packs left because I don't get a craving to eat them even when I am dying for chocolate.  They came well packaged with a cold pack and a durable plastic case.  Maybe if I wasn't allowed to consume sugar at all and this was the only option for chocolate, I might eat them, but considering the low satisfaction level when eating them and the high price, I would not buy them again.;negative
"The attractive packaging and customer reviews made me very eager to try this. I have recently learned the joys of dipping French bread into seasoned olive oil and had hoped this would be spectacular. It was anything but. I said it was insipid. Another member of my family said it even tasted ""tinny"". It really wasn't pleasant at all.
I will use it to cook with but really couldn't stomach it fresh. I got it on auto delivery and I'm cancelling that right now.";negative
It was just ok.;negative
I tried this after a friend recommended it. I used it in a chocolate chip cookie recipe and they didn't turn out anything like they usually do. The palm sugar has much larger granuals and it just doesn't taste the same. It's not bad but it's nothing like brown sugar in my opinion. I'm not sure how I'll use the rest of it but maybe it'll taste better in a different kind of recipe.;negative
This use to be my favorite cold coffee drink.....But ordered the 12 pack of 60 calories per can like I had been buying at my local store. What I received was a 12 pack of cans at 90 calories per can, not the 60 calories as advertised. For people watching their sugar intake, this makes a big difference. For this reason I took off stars from my rating. I was very disappointed and felt misled.;negative

I've sent an e-mail of complaint to Amazon, but I suspect they won't let me return them 'cause they may assume that I just didn't like the taste.  While I didn't like the raspberry ones, the others were at least OK.  I just don't want to take five minutes to eat one piece of candy.

"I was expecting something a little more snappy and a little less sandy. The flavor was okay (I personally love strong ginger flavors, which I am yet to find) however, they were too sweet for my tastes. I don't know, but it seems like Americans have a strong taste for excess sugar. It would have been better if there was less sugar and more spice, as well as less sandiness and more snappiness, imho. For those who like chocolate, try the extreme chocolate cookies, but be careful as they may cause burning of the stomache; esp. if many are eaten. Not my favorite Pamela's product.";negative
First off, I blame myself for not reading more carefully, I thought this was a large bag or multiple small bags. WAAAY too pricy. Second.the bag says CHIPS, which leads one to believe they should be a bit crunchy. NOPE. Chewy and stale. Very disappointed, will not order these again.;negative

"Lavazza Crema e Gusto - Ground Coffee

Okay, so I don't like it, I have used this brand and package of coffee before and found it fine but this time the taste was flat and didn't appeal to me.
Do you think it is possible for a manufacturer to repackage, change the sell by date and place their product back on the market where an unsuspecting consumer will purchase it?
I believe it happens to some products where the freshness date has expired or, as in the case of a box store, where the date is close to expiring can be sold for a reduced price.

I wouldnt recommend this to a friend and in this case buyer be aware.";negative
"YUCKY! We eat clean and are accustomed to various protein bars, powders, etc... that might not be very palatable to folks who normally eat salty, sweet, unhealthy, yumminess. So when we say these are yucky- we mean it.

I really wanted to like them. Great ingredient list. We love Quest products, and these seem SO promising. In fact, the first bite is pretty promising. But it's all downhill from there.

First there's this weird suck-all-the-saliva out of your mouth physical sensation. Then it's  like you have a mouthful of expired powdered milk. After you swallow it, you're left with what I can only describe as a lingering milky, chemical-ly aftertaste with some serious staying power. Super disappointing. If you want to mail me a shipping label, I'll send you the rest of mine for free.";negative

Tastes rough; low brow. One dimensional. Makes my mouth feel like an arid desert. Not a fan of the vegetable chunks floating around either.";negative
Just disgusting;negative
We have used pods for a long time and this is without a doubt the worst one we have ever purchased.  Clearly we will never buy it again.  The non-decaf French Roast is great - if you can handle the non-decaf go for it.;negative
Something has changed with the recipe of this non dairy creamer. It was ALL I used to use in coffee but it no longer tastes good or creamy. The creamy milk flavor is gone. I would NOT recommend this at all now.;negative

I have bought Turkish pistachios before but from We Got Nuts but thought I'd try them from a new vendor and though the nuts were okay, I prefer the ones from We Got Nuts and will only order from them in the future.  I think the difference must be in the roasting, or perhaps it's the freshness of the stock, but these nuts just had a slightly off flavor to me.;negative
"I have been buying powdered milk for seventeen years, during the days when Organic Valley produced a 12 or 16 ounce blue package of wonderful powdered, non-instant milk.
I add powdered milk in with other foods and to milk, to boost the flavor of omelettes and protein drinks and just milk drinks.  I enjoy eating the powdered milk, because it is a sweet flavor.  But not this product, because the sweetness is missing and replaced with another flavor that I cannot identify.  It appears as if there is a difference between full-cream and non-fat milk.  I dislike the fatty flavor of full-cream, which is not sweet but is unpleasant.";negative
"I am quite disappointed with this product because of the misleading ""no added salt"" on the front label.  When I read the nutrition label it said 350 mg of sodium per serving.  Then I read the ingredients label and saw there was a sea vegetable added instead of salt.  I have a serious heart problem that requires very low amounts of sodium.  In my case salt is salt be it from the sea or a salt mine.  I will not buy this product again and I will read labels more carefully in the future.";negative
"I was expecting that GREAT Juicy Fruit Gum from when I was a kid.  It didn't have such a yellow color to it back then.  At one point I think they even tried striping the gum with this darker yellow, similar to a Zebra pattern.

I think the taste is so artificial now that they probably should rename the gum altogether or GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL FORMULA!!

I will not be giving this gum out to any children, as was my intent, because of the aspartame.  It's a shame that they included this in a product that it's first ingredient is SUGAR and third ingredient is CORN SYRUP.  Isn't that enough sugar?  I cannot imagine that the addition of an artificial
sweetener would make this product remotely better.

The taste of this gum leaves a bad after taste in your mouth once you're done chewing it.  I won't be buying it again.";negative
First of all the flavor was disappointing.  But the bigger issue is that they arrived with one third chips and the rest crumbs or chip dust.  I was surprised at how they arrived so broken up, considering they are in the sturdy tubes.;negative
"I read a review that Milk Thistle does not mix well with water.

I'll make it brief.  These are terriibbllee!  They don't have a taste, so, it isn't that.  It's the texture.  When you wet them and they become pliable, they become slippery and rubbery when they are in your mouth.  I can't even compare them to anything else because they aren't food-like at all.  If texture is as important to you with food as it is for me, don't buy these!!;negative
"It has a funny aftertaste, unlike other porcini powders I have used in the past. It also does not state a country of origin. I looked up the company web  site but  there is no phone number, even the CEO has only a first name. I have ordered the brand I used to buy again and will see how they compare. Chances are this stuff will go back to Indiana.
Meanwhile I will NOT put that powder on a steak that cost 18 Dollars per pound.";negative
These things are terrible.  Most of them are old and stale.  I ordered them when I reordered the dried pineapple I use in a recipe for fruit-nut bread, along with walnuts.  Their dried pineapple is fantastically delicious:  I'm on my third bag.  If you want good pineapple, order the Sincerely Nuts brand.  However, if you want nuts, look some place else.  Perhaps they should change their name to Sincerely Pineapple.;negative
"This Vita CoCo is not what it's advertised; go online and read for yourself before you order.  It is not at all good, either, tastes a slight bit salty with added Vitamin C (now why did they go and do that!!!).

I had to revise my feedback.

Three days ago, I started to feel dizzy. I am dizzy even whenI am  laying down. Can't bend over without a dizzy spell. Never before have I had vertigo. I went online to learn what side effect Xylitol can cause. Diarrhea and dehydration among of them. This is NOT A NATURAL PRODUCT!  It is created by using man-maid ingredients. It repped my insides ...What a big mistake I made when decided to try it!
By the way, I used it only ones a day in my morning  tea-2 small tea sppons.";negative

"As a busy person without medical issues trying to lose weight, I love using these as a meal replacement, both to lose weight and when I just don't have time to cook or don't want to fall into a food coma.  Premier Protein seems to have the best nutritional profile for the cost, and the chocolate and banana flavors actually taste good

However, this strawberries and cream flavor is absolutely disgusting.  Would not recommend.  I gave it 2-stars because it still did the job of filling me up";negative
I purchased this for my peanut allergic 10 year old, as she's been dying to try a peanut butter alternative and the good reviews for it looked promising. After we received it, I tried it first, because I'm a peanut butter addict and figured if I liked it, so would she. WRONG!! It was horrible!!!! My daughter didn't like it either. No taste, bland, and no similarities to peanut butter whatsoever. I have to disagree with the many 5 star reviews here. Into the garbage it will go-a complete waste of $15+ dollars!;negative
"BEWARE!!  The price on these is ridiculous!  The way I read this, it looked like 3 packages of 24 individual packs EACH.  The entire thing is only 24 individual packs TOTAL.  I need these to make little Christmas snack packs with other candy and cookies for the staff in the nursing home where my mom lives.  This is about 1/3 of what I need.
However, I found another vendor that sells 4 times this amount for just 2X the price.  A reasonable deal.  I definitely will not make this error again, not shop from this vendor!
I did not compare offers carefully,  and I'm paying for it.";negative
"Oh I don't like this tea at all! Why did I try something ""new""? Was it the cheaper prices, the 50% extra free, or the strange name that got me??? Truthfully, if you love tea, stick with the brand you love best. I should have paid for the PG Tips and I would have gotten what I paid for.  Instead I got Typhoo, the equvalent of worst quality tea dust scraped of the floor in the bagging facility for mediocre tea.";negative
"I ORIGINALLY GAVE THIS A 5* RATING AND I DO SAY THAT THE NUTS SEEM TO BE OF ABOVE AVERAGE QUALITY... BUT I AM NOT HAPPY NOW THAT I HAVE REALIZED THAT THESE NUTS ARE NOT USDA CERTIFIED ORGANIC. I HAD A ANSWERED THAT THE ORGANIC SYMBOL MIGHT BE LOCATED ON THE BACK OF THE PACKAGE A MONTH OR SO WHEN SENT A QUESTION TO ANSWER ABOUT THIS PRODUCT. I JUST RECEIVED A PACKAGE OF THESE NUTS LAST WEEK AND DID IN FACT TURN THE BAG OVER ONLY TO DISCOVER THE MISSING CERTIFICATION. USDA ORGANIC IS IMPORTANT TO ME AS I HAVE MADE A CHOICE NOT TO EAT GMO FOODS AND TRY FAITHFULLY TO FOLLOW A CLEAN LIFESTYLE. I WILL BE GOING BACK TO BOB'S RED MILL BRAND AS THEY ARE CERTIFIED ORGANIC BY THE USDA AND PRODUCED IN THE USA. THESE NUTS ARE PRODUCED IN CHINA (I'M SURE THE STANDARDS THERE ARE NOT OF THE SAME MAGNITUDE AS OUR STANDARDS HERE... SO MUCH SO THAT I WON'T EVEN GIVE MY DOG TREATS PRODUCED IN CHINA!!!)

IF THE ORGANIC CERTIFICATION AND USA PRODUCTION IS NOT IMPORTANT TO YOU THEN THESE NUTS APPEAR TO BE OF GOOD QUALITY AND YOU WILL BE PLEASED.... BELOW IS MY ORIGINAL REVIEW...

THESE NUTS ARE SOOOOO YUMMY!!!! THEY ARRIVED IN A LARGE (5 LB) RESEALABLE BAG. I LIKE TO ROAST MY OWN NUTS SO THESE WERE PERFECT. I HAVE BEEN BUYING A DIFFERENT BRAND AND WAS A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT CHANGING BRANDS. THESE ARE MUCH MORE REASONABLY PRICED... YOU KNOW THE SAYING, ""YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR""...? NOT WITH THESE YOU GET SO MUCH MORE!! THEY ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE OTHER BRAND I WAS BUYING. THE NUTS ARE LARGE, NOT BROKEN TO PIECES AND VERY FRESH! YOU FOLKS HAVE A CUSTOMER FOR LIFE!!!

IN MY OPINION YOU WOULD BE 'SERIOUSLY NUTS' TO BUY ANOTHER BRAND... EVERY PUN INTENDED!!! ENJOY!!! (SORRY FOR THE ALL CAPS BUT I REALLY AM EXCITED WRITING THIS REVIEW :-) !!! )";negative
"So I am a huge coffee drinker, although I tend to like the medium roasts over the bold/dark, I drink it all (even an occasional flavor coffee).  I enjoy my coffee black, so the flavor of the coffee is VERY important to me, since it cannot be masked/overlooked by sugar/cream.

I was excited to try this sampler pack as it offered what I hoped was a good variety.  I typically brew the medium roasts at the medium cup setting as the setting works great for all other pods of medium roasts by other brands that I purchased.  I have found ALL the coffees in this sampler pack to be weak, VERY weak.  Even my attempt to make my coffee stronger by changing the  setting to smallest cup available did not help.  All the coffees were weak with little or no flavor.  It was like drinking murky water.

Such a shame as I typically end up buying in bulk so I can have my coffee at work as well, and many times my co-workers come into my office and brew a cup because they like my selection of kcups over what is in the kitchen.  Beantown Roasters will not get my business again until I try it first.  I am not taking the chance to purchase and hope I like - they will have to send me free samples first.";negative
"75% of the biscuits came broken.  The only shape that was in tact is the triangles.  The fingers are broken in half.  The circles are broken into 3-4-5 pieces.  I bought this for a gift and hadn't intended to open it but since I was giving it to a senior I thought it better to investigate how difficult it would be to open the box.  I want a 75% refund.

The tin box was not damaged in any way.

I have ordered Mrs Fields cookies through Amazon for the same lady and they were delivered in perfect condition.";negative
I am a huge chocolate fan, and I mean I adore my chocolate. This however was not the case with these nibs. They had an odd smell, nothing like others I've gotten. They smelled a bit like petroleum fuel. So, I ended up throwing them out because I could  =not even use them for skin or body care due to the smell, and was afraid to use them for food grade items as I don't know what caused the odd odor from this bag of chocolate nib chips. I will not be buying these again, nor do I recommend them.;negative
too chewy. didn't seem fresh.;negative
This stuff is so bad that my four and five year old will not touch it. They will eat the cheap microwave popcorn that is so salty it leaves you feeling parched with a raw tongue after just a few bites. If that doesnt tell you how bad it is maybe the fact that the first two ingredients are soybean oil, followed by palm oil.  There is no flavor to this stuff. It simply leaves your popcorn feeling and tasting oily. No yummy movie theater flavor that other reviews have stated ( did these people even try it!) I LOVE me some movie theater popcorn (truly the only reason I go to the theater). This left me feeling very disappointed.;negative
This salt has a perfume odor.  When I opened the bag, the smell puffed into my face.  It smelled a little like shampoo, and maybe a little like hand lotion.  Hard to say, but it is apparently a quality control problem.  I don't wear perfume and I certainly will not eat it.  It stinks.  Very disappointing.;negative
Just bitter tast. No aroma.;negative
These were so disappointing! These aren't pieces of baklava, they're bites. I included a picture. I basically paid for 12 bites of baklava. Even my kids said these were tiny. They weren't the best tasting either. Overall highly disappointed in this purchase. Was a shame, because had it been good, I'd have been ordering on the regular, because I love baklava.;negative
. This bottle of Mustard is completely different from the one I just finished. That last bottle was sweet, this one is spicy. I now understand why the reviews were so mixed. Evidently Hickory Farms cannot maintain any consistency in their product. I do not recommend this nor will I purchase any more of their products.;negative
Writing this review before I pop it up... 2 of my 6 bags were open on the bottom so the box was full of popcorn.  This stuff isn't cheap so I am disappointed that 1/3 of my purchase is unusable.  Will pop it up to give a review on taste.  Thinking since this has happened to others, Arrowhead Mills should think about making their packaging stronger.;negative
"I had been buying Stretch Island apricot fruit rollups, and they have quite a pleasing taste.  When I came across Joray, I decided to give it a try, hoping for an even better taste experience.  What a disappointment this was!!

-- The apricot taste is barely discernable.  In fact this is not even remotely what true apricot tastes. This is more like a lousy candy taste than a real fruit taste.

-- The ""thing"" leaves a horrible aftertaste in your mouth...the kind that you would want to brush your teeth after and gargle with Listerin mouthwash.

-- The ""thing"" is packed with yellow and red food colorings, which gives it a fake look that does not remotely resemble what true apricot color is.

-- As if that wasn't enough, the ingredients include flour and corn syrup solids.  How is that for a healthy concoction?

-- The $29.59 I spent is a total waste. Now I know why no local retailers carry this thing. If any did, I would have bought one serving for testing ... not all 48 servings.";negative
"My order was Dec. 2014... the 3 pack I received was expired ""best used by June 2014"" tags on the packages.  I tried one anyway, and it did not rise, and tasted badly.  Sorry... this is the 1st poor rating I've had to write.";negative
This hummus is so fiery hot that, for me, it was inedible. I like spicy foods, but with hummus I want to taste the chickpeas, veggies, garlic and other ingredients. I might have liked it better if it contained small chunks of avocado, but instead it had a thoroughly blended, tasteless, porridge-like consistency. After one sampling with a bit of pita bread, I threw it in the trash.;negative
I am used to Cucina brand balsamic glaze which is fairly tasty, in my opinion. This blood orange by Roland tastes off and fakey. There is a starchy back taste and texture to it (could be the corn starch in it). Too many ingredients for what should be a simple balsamic reduction. Will give away or throw away.;negative
I grew up on white cornmeal cornbread.  I bought this thinking I could make the white cornbread again, as white cornmeal is no longer available in the local grocery stores here.  While I do not like a fine grain, powdery cornmeal, I certainly want one that is ground enough to give a nice crumb to the cornbread.  This is insufficently ground to make cornbread or corn muffins with in my opinion and my taste.  Will not buy again.;negative
"These are FAKE!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!

"Perfect...just a little something sweet to keep you going...no aftertaste of any kind.  (Because of the reviews, just ordered the berry and orange...can't wait to try those, too.)  Great tasting sugar free candy is not always easy to find...this one hits a home run.  And as a bonus, the box is adorable..easy to pop in your purse. :)

"only about one third of these are good- just the plain coffee ones and even those are kind of weak through the keurig.

I used to buy them all the time until i found out that they were the cause of my bloating,  diarrhea, extreme painfull gas everytime i ate a bar. This is caused by the chicory root and inulin that they use as filler. Stay away. Not healthy at all.;negative
Without a doubt one of the foulest things I have ever put in my mouth! Sincerely, they tasted very much like they had been fried rancid oil. They were for a fundraiser and left me scrambling and n the 11th hour! HORRID.;negative
"I love Apricot Preserves. Nothing like Apricot preserves on toast with butter! Yum ! My Mom used to make all sorts of preserves at home. To me preserves need to have whole fruit not a bunch of sugar and pectin as a thickener. I bought this preserves because of all the high reviews and the high apricot content. Unfortunately there it is so thick with so much pectin that you can use it for putty to patch holes in your wall. I guess one use for it would be in pies, where you don't want the preserves to be runny. I would not by this product again. So far my favorite Apricot preserves outside of my Mom's is D'Arbo Apricot preserves from Austria. I buy it from a local bakery near my home for $12.50 for a 20+ ounce jar. I found D'arbo advertised on Amazon but it's a spread not a preserve; not what I am looking for. As far as Amazon, Clearbrook Farms California Apricot preserves is my favorite. Also has nice large pieces of apricot, great apricot taste, and a nice jar but costs me more than the D'Arbo. Please read my other Apricot preserve reviews.";negative
"This is very old roasted coffee from Koffee Kult.
The web description of this coffee said that it has BIG BODY, LOW ACIDITY AND ""CRISP"" SWEET FLAVOR.
However, it was strange that the company did not describe any other important flavors that a good coffee must have, such as caramel, chocolate, apple, peach, well balance...etc.

Anyway, I grinded 11 grams of coffee beans and used a cup that can hold 210 grams of water for cupping purpose. I measured the ground weights exactly and I followed SCAA cupping protocols. Immediately, I realized that there was absolutely NO AROMA from the ground coffee at all which indicates that this coffee is roasted quite a while ago. I poured hot water and waited few min to ""Break the cup"" which means breaking top layer of the coffee ground and smell the aroma. As I had expected, again, no Aroma at all. Definitely old beans. Finally cupping which I knew already that it was useless. But I gave it a try. Zero flavors. there was no ""crisp"" sweet flavor and No Big Body. Less Acidity, yes. Basically this coffee was FLAT, complete deprived of any good flavors that good and freshly roasted coffee should have.

Then only thing that I was glad that I did not pay the full price and shipping.
Probably I will be using the left over coffee for ""Flavored cold brew"" and I wonder that even that might not come out good enough to drink.

Also, on the website coffee description, it says : Artisan roasted fresh to perfection on our small batch roasters, and roasted immediately prior to packaging. Every bag is consistently the same with our roasting profile system!.

First, I thought that they roast the coffee I ordered prior to shipping out to me, but, AFTER READING THE DESCRIPTION MORE CAREFULLY, ""roasted immediately prior to PACKAGING"", it does not say ""prior to shipping via Amazon Prime"", so i guess it is my bad to miss-understood. They might have roasted beans and packaged into bags immediately, but no one knows how long those coffees were sitting in the warehouse because there is no roast date indicated on the bag.

Koffee Kult was a big disappointment for me in so many levels.";negative
This is useless for me.  I buy caramel syrup for one purpose.  To drizzle on top of my lattes.  This syrup is so thick and heavy that it sinks right to the bottom.  I tried drizzling lightly, it totally demolished my foam.  Very first world problem I know but I'm angry to have wasted my money.  I will try to return it.  Only 2 stars for the taste.  This sauce is best used for ice cream and desserts.;negative
This coffee is acidic.;negative
I found this Ghee to be almost tasteless -- not the wonderful buttery flavor I was expecting.  I had been buying Organic Valley Ghee, which is a superior product, but because of the lower price on this brand, I decided to try it.  Guess it's true that you only get what you pay for.  Will definitely go back to Organic Valley!;negative
"I'd had the honey-mustard ones and loved them, and was about to order them again when this variety caught my eye. They sounded delicious.

Well, it stops there. These are truly inedible. They are so overseasoned and so oversalted, they make your eyes water. The only way to eat them at all is to vigorously rub each one with a napkin first, and even then, it's not an enjoyable experience.

Can't believe I'm stuck with a whole case of these things. I won't even get through one bag. My advice... never buy a case of anything unless you know for a fact you love it. Even if you DID enjoy another variety of the same product.";negative
"I love my Donut Shop coffee and I thought these were the same ""line"" of coffee flavors for the Keurig.

"Package and Product Page Cons ~

For a few years now  I have  been  doing  gluten-free  and severe  allergen shopping  and Chebe  is the winner  when it comes  to my biggest  pet-peeve with companies  in this market.  Theyou have most  Asterisk * and contradictions regarding  their product that  I have  seen thus far.

They claim to  be Free of 13 allergens. Of those 6 have an * and one ** Asterisk  because  the mix calls for  eggs  but the company  counts their mix as a  egg  free product.

Those with  a  Asterisk  are given  this miniature  printed paragraph.  *made on shared equipment with this ingredient  ( under strict  cleaning process / allergen  control  program. )

Yet on their Amazon  product  page  under  the  important  information  header appears
In bold type  Safety  Warnings :  Allergen Information : Contains no common  allergens.  Don't  get me wrong  I am thankful  Amazon  added  this area. My purchase of Chebe  was before  this area was added.

The reason that I  take  the time to mention  these things is because  gluten-free  and allergen free shopping  is expensive  , getting  a  product  home to try and find it isn't  all it claims to be is fusterating.  But it can also be frightening . If there is  a  allergen  present.  So claims such as these don't  logically  seem right

Product Cons ~

When our Chebe  Bread  All Purpose  Baking  Mixes arrived  we were excited  to  try them.
Being the  first gluten-free  free bread product  that I  had baked. The texture was really  different.  The roll itself  seemed very salty and tart. None of  us found the taste to be  enjoyable.

Two of us after just  a small taste  began experincing  a stinging  sensation  on our tongue  and in our throats. Along with  coughing  A sign that there were nuts or tree nuts present in something  we were eating.  Benadryl  was needed.  Fortunately there wasn't a  trip to  the  emergency  room.  So what ever their allergy  standards  these mixes aren't  safe for everyone.

My grandmother who isn't  as food sensitive  saved the remaining  rolls in air tight container.  The  next morning  she showed me that they had turned  hard as a rock. They were like clay you let harden overnight  for a kenln.  Never had anything  like that  happened in our Lock n Lock storage  containers  before.

Over All Opinion ~

Chebe makes a lot of claims  and  delivers  more hype  than results  in my opinion.  It was my experience  that their allergy  clean process  is insufficient. The bread itself  has a lot to be desired in the  way it tastes;  as well as it's  store ability factor.  I  won't be  buying  anything  else  by Chebe  based on this experience,  therefore  I  could not in good conscience recomend them to others.";negative
"Like most people before who reviewed these hot chocolate k-cups, this is a watery hot chocolate. I think the problem is that most people want a nice big mug of hot chocolate, on my Keurig that is a large cup - this waters down the chocolate. If you use the medium or small cups then you get an OK cup of hot chocolate. Of course, then you're paying way too much so it just isn't worth the money. For a decent cup you'll need to use two k-cups on small/medium.

Use a my k-cup instead with regular store hot chocolate :)";negative
"My wife and I are huge Seinfeld fans. We watch the show all the time, like mindlessly listening to music, we mindlessly watch Seinfeld. Wellone of the episodes featured Drakes Coffee Cakes, so I couldn't help but order a box. There are 10 cakes, wrapped in sets of 2. They're about the size of a small muffin, with a lot of loose crumble along the top. The inside is sort of soft, but not overly soactually the cakes arrived a little dried out all together. They're cinnamon flavored, and overall taste very mediocre. I like delicious treats, rich chocolates, cheesecakes, all sorts of thingshowever these cakes aren't really comparable to homemade baking. I'd only recommend these to those looking to relive a nostalgic moment with a bit of flare, but as a dessert, I would highly suggest looking elsewhere.

I'd also like to point out, the box has a retail price of $3.49, so the price offered by this seller is a bit outrageous.";negative
I made the mistake of ordering these the last time Amazon had a special deal.  The gum was hard and lost any flavor it had after a few jaw-breaking chews.  I offered it to my friends at work to see if it was just me, but everyone had the same reaction. I wouldn't be writing this comment if the gum had any redeemng quality.;negative
No date found on pkg so unable to determine if they are expired.  They are covered with a barely noticeable white powdery substance.  The pretzel part is not firm when bitten into as it immediately becomes fine crumbly pieces.  Must be edible as no ill effects so far, but weird consistency spoils the overall taste.  Don't intend to eat any more, and even have reservations about donating them to a food pantry.;negative
Although this is a good deal for K-cups, the coffee itself is gross. I've been drinking coffee for over 30 years, and this coffee tastes like hot water with a hint of chemical flunk to it. I would not recommend, it has not even a hint of coffee flavor. If you want a good cup of coffee, pay a few dollars more and stick with Keurig labeled brand cups. I recommend Columbia, Nantucket Blend or Dark Magic.;negative
Corn syrup coffe creamer anyone ?;negative
"I bought this after emailing the Traditional Medicinals company and asking them why I can no longer find their ""pink"" pau d'arco tea on the supermarket shelves anymore.  They told me that, due to sustainability issues of the plant in the rain forest, they had to end their relationship with their supplier.  So I decided to try Buddha Teas' pau d'arco tea, which, frankly, was the only pink (as opposed to the much milder yellow) variety I could find.  Needless to say, I was disappointed.  Buddha Teas' pau d'arco tea lacks the pungent, woodsy flavor of the Traditional Medicinals brand.  Buddha Teas' pink pau d'arco tastes the same to me as Traditional Medicinals' yellow pau d'arco.  That is, weak and essentially flavorless, even after steeping it overnight.";negative
"Was this a bad batch or true average of this company's product? Was it a subjective dislike or is this rotten taste genuine to all tastebuds?

So many questions. So few conclusions.

The 12-pack was moderately priced. The packaging and facts pleasant enough. I'd never tried Yuvia but I've had Zico, Vita Coco, Goya, Amy and Brian's, Harvest Bay, Coco Zia, direct from a green coconut.. you get it. I go out on a limb to diversify my hydration situation.

Zico is an unsweet, ""green"" kind of variety with moderate aftertaste. Plastic container sometimes affects flavor.

Goya by polarity is sweetened, candy like, aftertaste of sugar. Did I mention sugar?

Vita Coco is sweet, but not sugary, with a nutty pleasant aftertaste. If you're trying coconut water first time I usually suggest this one. It's sort of a coconut rainbow to cut your teeth on.

Yuvia? Extremely tasteless on introduction to the tongue, which flips within seconds to kick you in the face with a disconcerting bitter rotten flavor that dissipates. I handed them off to other patrons of nature's Gatorade and the results were the same: bitter beer face, tongues out, throwing the offensive container away.

This lot of Yuvia sent to me wasn't expired I checked that much. But.. I will never buy another carton to try again. I drank the ones I didn't give away. I chugged them for nutrient and hydration's sake alone.

Coconut powder tastes better. A bottle of plain water is more refreshing. This brand for whatever inexplicable cause, takes the personal award of Worst Coconut Water.

I hope I just got a bad batch because you're out of YOUR nut if you've trained yourself to like Yuvia. Yuck, yuck, bleeeeeeck!";negative
"The ""Violet"" is not a true violet, but instead, more of a navy blue.  Besides that fact, it is NOT good for use on cookies.  Unlike airbrushing, the spray goes everywhere and has a horrible, chemically smell and taste.  I had high hopes for this product, being the Wilton brand, but unfortunately I can not recommend this at all.";negative
"Well, I had hoped to enjoy this coffee, but darn...the flavor seems odd, slightly burned and bitter, not smooth in the slightest. Of the eight different flavored coffees that I've tried since buying my Breville Keurig coffeemaker, this one is the least successful for me. Adding cream and sugar doesn't seem to help either, as it emphasizes the unpleasant aftertaste.

I'm getting smarter and buying samples of various coffees before I saddle myself with a large quantity of a product that doesn't work for me. I just wish I'd done it sooner.";negative
I've ordered from this company for awhile now, they started out great. Gradually went from great to really bad to a rancid taste. I don't know if it had to do with the weather or what but I hope they get better. I was a loyal customer and will go back if they do get better and fix the issue s.;negative
"Disgusting.  Expensive.  They stink like rotten fish, first of all. Second, they look and feel like cartilage. And the one bite I took would not break down when I tried to chew it.  Between that and the smell, I actually wanted to vomit.  I drained and rinsed them, boiled them with the lid off, then sauted them, then added homemade curry to go with it and try to mask the flavor.  I figured since they looked faintly similar to pad Thai noodles, curry would go well. I ended up throwing it in the garbage and throwing all the unopened packages away.

Just eat regular pasta or rice and account for the calories elsewhere. Yuck.";negative
"UPDATE....with star reduction...while these cookies do taste great, all orders have arrived with cookies broken or crushed. I am cancelling future subscribe and save orders due this problem

A tasty cookie that is also healthy.  I like it because it tastes less ""sweet"" than most cookies.  Great with coffee or tea.";negative
"It doesn't taste too bad; just don't expect to find the fine hairy tea leaves that are signature mark of white tea in the tea bag. Compare the mixture to any green tea mix and you'll agree they look the same whereas white tea has a lighter shade and fuzzies over it.";negative
Ordered 2 bags and I think the order is fulfilled by Costco. Both bags were ripped and the nuts didn't look that great, maybe because they were exposed for a while. Next time I will go to Costco and get them in person. For the price it was a waste;negative
"SUMMARY: If you're looking for a dark roast with full flavor for your Tassimo, keep looking. Hey -- it's Maxwell House after all. Check out the newer Gevalia Dark Roasts.

DETAIL: After Starbucks severed its relationship with Kraft, I was looking for a decent brew for my Tassimo brewer. The Maxwell House French Roast was Kraft's early attempt at this, and it disappoints. It's OK if you stop the brew short, but it's a bit weak if you let it go full cycle. It's arguably the best Maxwell House offering, but it's no Starbucks.

CONCLUSION: If you miss Starbucks, but want to keep the flexibility of the Tassimo, check out the three Gevalia Dark Roasts (Breakfast, House, and Italian), as these more closely resemble Starbuck's Breakfast, House, and Verona blends, respectively. These three form the core of my one-cup brewing, supplemented by a number of espressos and cremas available (Mastro Lorenzo being my fav).";negative
"This DaVinci Zero Calorie  Sugar- free Chocolate Syrup was disappointing. Of all the DaVinci Sugar Free Syrups I use and enjoy, this was just not good.  This is the first one I've had in a plastic bottle so im not sure if that's part of the problem. It's very weak with no chocolate flavor but a very strong bitter chemical bite, very artifical! I'm very acustumed to SPLENDA and it never leaves an after taste but some products containing SPLENDA that have other additives do. I use these syrups for cooking  with good success but I ended up throwing out the pudding I was making. This ""syrup"" is very watery, light tan in color and just doesn't resemble chocolate flavor in any way. DaVinci is an excellent Company with top notch customer service. They stand behind all of their products and are sending me a replacement flavor of my choice. I give them 5 stars but had to take off 3 for the icky chocolate flavor. I will continue to use DaVinci sugar free syrups and highly recommend them, just not this particular chocolate flavor.";negative
Oh, wow - this is disgusting. I've been on a sugar-free diet for several months now and can totally hang with any artificial flavoring / Splenda taste there is, but this is really foul. It smells awful when you open it, and guess what - it tastes equally as bad. I genuinely cannot understand what this could be used for, it's just disgusting. You are better off not buying this at all than wasting your money.;negative
Have ordered these before and this is my forth delivery, however, all 12 cans were dented, decided to keep because I needed to use right away.  This is the first time in a yr that I have ever had a problem, I would still highly recommend this product and I will be buying this again!;negative
Disappointing.  If the merchant had integrity, he would have identified this as a Lambertz product.  I was specifically trying to avoid product by this manufacturer, as I have found it to be always second-rate.  Better than Kirkland or the bottom of the barrel, but always somewhat wanting in quality and taste.  Had I known, I would not have bought this.  And I will not buy again.;negative
Unless you like super weak tasting coffee, then you'll like it. Came in good condition, fast ship, (then again I pay for prime)...but tried 3 times, at different size, smaller than usual on setting...and ...no taste.;negative
Very weak;negative
"Lots of folks here seem to love this olive oil, but I'm not in love.

The first thing to hit my tounge was bitterness, like from ground up pits. Then there was a flavorless smoothness, then a VERY peppery finish.  There was no hint of green, grassy, herbiness at any point.

The color is beautiful, tho a little pale;  it will be fine for sauting and cooking, but I could not use it fresh on a salad or for dipping bread.";negative
These are normally delicious (especially frozen!) but these were stale. I think they were exposed to heat and the cocoa butter rose to the surface leaving a whitish haze. Years ago someone from Hershey told me that can happen and that it's still safe to eat just not nearly as tasty. Disappointing, especially considering I added them to Christmas gifts I mailed before realizing they were bad. Amazon is refunding my money and offered to pay shipping on a replacement from another vendor but I've noticed others are having the same problem.;negative
Sour and slightly bitter, as if they were picked while not ripe and then freeze dried some how. Dry, but we soak in cottage cheese over night and add lots of sweetener - the sweetener helps some but there is still an aftertaste.;negative
"This was the second batch of British candy I tried. I think it's nice to at least try a couple of batches in case one may have been bad, but it doesn't mean the rest are. This time, they were both undesirable. The only candy I semi enjoyed was the strawberry Fizz Wizz, but I prefer the Pop Rocks we have here. Like in my other review, I admit to being a picky eater so I had my family try as well (they'll eat just about anything unlike me) and they weren't fans. I felt like my teeth were being attacked by some of the ultra chewy candy (I get it, it's sugar so it's not good for you, but rarely do my teeth hurt from candy).
If you're not a picky eater and want to try something new, I'd say trying this is worth a shot, but still, it's not ideal in taste.";negative
"I am a person who experiments with coffee, both in flavor, and manufacturer. Wanting to become more healthy and perhaps enjoy my coffee more I decided to try this product. I had a version of the French press when this arrived. I had used this to replace my typical 12 cut drip brewer. The content of this roast would not allow processing in the French press. It would cake and stop any pressure to move water thru it.

When calling on the manufacturer, I received a quick and courteous response. They were very helpful and fully stand behind their product. The fact that the ingredients were healthy was the main reasoning I wanted to make this all work. I recently purchased a single cup drip brewer, which I also enjoy. However, as with the last experiment, this mix will not work in it either, due to the same compactness experienced in the French press. The water stays puddled on the top and refuses to filter through, eventually overflowing and dripping to the base of the brewer.

When purchasing this substitute, be assured it is not liked other substitutes in flavor. It has a flavor all it's own not resembling coffee in any way. I find it more like drinking tea while mentally expecting to taste coffee. I totally support their recommendation that you pour it loosely into a cup and add boiling water, even eating the remaining grains to gain the full benefit of the ingredients. Just don't expect to brew it in a coffee brewer.";negative
"I got these as a laugh for the office.  Unfortunately, they were a dud.  Not one person out of 10 or so who tasted them could even stomach them..  Perhaps for kids only.  I wouldn't expect adults to ""love"" these but I thought they would be tolerated a bit more..";negative
"I'm a big fan of Jack Link's beef jerky, especially their flavored jerky's. I hadn't seen this one in the stores so when it went on sale on Amazon I scooped it up. Generally the beef nuggets and tendercuts style jerky's are not my favorite, for some reason the beef gets very rubbery compared to the regular style cuts, but I knew this diving into the bag of jerky.

At first the taste was like the beef had been dropped in a pile of debris on a smokehouse floor, smokey, meaty and ashy tasting. I thought maybe it was just the initial taste  and continued to chew. It only worsened as I continued and eventually I swallowed and was met with a disgusting taste left in my mouth.

Now that I have all four bags remaining I'm not sure what to do with them. I may give them away as a gag gift for the holidays and literally watch people gag as they try to eat this.";negative
"This year, I've tried every kind of gummy fruit snack around, trying to find something somewhat healthy, but that still tastes like candy.  After reading the labels on some of these expensive ""organic"" fruit snacks, I realized that you are better off with good brands from the grocery store.  Most regular brands have fruit juice as the first ingredient, which means that the product is mostly fruit juice.  Other additives make up 2% or so of the total.  Several regular brands have no artificial colors or flavors, but those that do contain only a tiny percentage of it.  Most of these so-called healthy brands have sweetener as the first four ingredients!!!  It may be organic sugar or tapioca syrup, but it is still sugar!!  The cheaper brands have more fruit juice and less sweetener.  (and they taste better!)  Your preference in texture and flavor may be different than mine, but my favorites are Mott and Ocean Spray.  They have only natural flavors and aren't as sticky or hard to chew as some others.  (I have TMJ, so prefer softer jelly snacks)";negative
I was hopeful about these lollipops. They have great reviews, you get a lot of them, and they seemed healthier than regular lollipops.

"First, I am very disappointed. I order because I love organic food. I never buy organic coffee because I didn't think about coffee also need organic. So I searching organic coffee in amazon and found it. Also, amazon recommend this stuff. Price is not bad, so I just order it. I also saw some pictures how they made coffee. But when I open, smell is not fresh. I was working coffee shop for while longtime ago, so I know something about coffee well. OK... So I grind coffee first, and still smells like burnt. Coffee roasting process is wrong I guess. If coffee roasting was wrong, coffee get burnt taste. I can't explain well with English, but it is sure. . I am sure this is organic coffee because we can see ""USDA"" logo. But I would like to don't buy this product again. I am drinking coffee always without sugar and milk. So, I know taste well.

When you mix with milk and sugar, you never know coffee taste. If you love coffee, you know what I am talking about. Fresh coffee should be have bubbles when hot water meet coffee. I just finished grind coffee BUT why bubbles is not showing?

I am amazon prime member, but I will not trust amazon recommend product again.
They should check more coffee roasting!! I know one person review is not really changed them. But I will use this coffee for air freshener..  I can pay twice more than this price If I can buy fresh coffee. Where I can buy fresh coffee? How can Starbucks coffee taste is better than organic coffee? Sould we drink this coffee because of organic? I am honest person. First time made bad review in amazon.";negative
"This ""Teas' Tea Latte, Black Tea"", does not taste very good. I do like black tea but not this. A pro would be that it is very mildly sweet; 18 grams of sugar per 8oz. serving.

"You know how in China and Japan they mostly eat white rice but at the same time some really smart integrated health care professionals in America insist that brown rice would be healthier because it has more minerals, B vitamins and a lower glycemic index?

Well, maybe that's a pile of noise.

Maybe the people in Japan and China actually know what they're doing this time (just like pretty much every other time). Maybe the miniscule quantities of vitamins and minerals in brown rice are more than outweighed by allergens and other noxious things (like cyanide) in the bran, which help prevent baby rice grains in the wild from being devoured in the first place.

On the other hand, I gotta say, it *does* taste good.";negative
"Price increase is ridiculous. This coffee has been around $10.49 for some time; now it's more than doubled in price. $21+ for a 10oz bag of coffee is outrageous and not worth it for any brand.

Luckily, I do enjoy the golden sweetener and will continue to purchase that.";negative

WARNING TO BUYERS: It is no longer the blue and green package pictured, by Sempio, made in Korea. It is now a brown packaging by Jang Foods, made in China. Horrible taste and texture. I cannot eat it, and I am not too picky about food. I just unsubscribed.";negative
I never expected granola to contain flax seed -- something I'm allergic to.  I sat down to a nice bowl of granola, and it sure tasted good! Then my throat started to itch. Then my stomach started to cramp. I stopped eating and checked the label -- sure enough, near the bottom, 'ground flax seed'.  My husband, who is not much of a granola eater, tried some a few days later, and although he isn't allergic to flax, he found it still made his mouth and throat itch. If you're not allergic to flax, by all means enjoy it, but if you are -- DON'T TOUCH IT!;negative

"I LOVE chocolate and adore raspberries (Godiva Dark Chocolate Raspberry Truffles were my idea of heaven).  This coffee has been a major disappointment.  I drink a lot of flavored coffees and decided to try this one due to the rave reviews and being a combo of two of my favorite flavors.

I've gone through one box, and am either giving the second one away (if I can find someone to take it) or just pitching it.  The quality control on the flavorings is HORRIBLE.  One kcup will be actually almost pleasant (though the raspberry overtones *always* have a ""tinny"" aftertaste), and the next will be so strong in both scent and flavor that it is unbearable and gets dumped.

If the flavor/strength of the chocolate and raspberry were consistent throughout, it would be two and a half stars.  As it stands, it's more of a waste of water and electricity.";negative
I was really looking forward to this salt substitute but it falls far short in my opinion. Tastes like a glorified version of Mrs. Dash and far from salt flavor.

Yum , real salt but good for you.;negative

This was my first time trying this bread. I was hesitant because it was Rudi's and I've never REALLY enjoyed any of their products. Apparently I was more masochistic than I realized. I made what should have been a delicious turkey and cheddar sandwich, everything was great, except the bread. I can forgive gluten-free products for being a bit dense, although SO MANY BRANDS have found a way to get past this. I can forgive them for lacking the moisture that wheat products tend to have, but that's happening less and less with other brands. But when my sandwich fell apart in my hands (more crumbles than I could count) after my first bite I found myself more annoyed at the those other things as well. When I got home I tossed the rest in the trash and ordered another brand from Fresh (La Brea- SO GOOD!).This bread is an utter failure.;negative
I have been buying cacao nibs for a while now.  I absolutely enjoy adding them to various breakfast items.

It was truly poor experience.;negative
Not as fresh as I had hoped.;negative

"This honey just arrived and I was so excited to taste it based on the wealth of information available about how good it is for you. I love regular raw honey and guess that I was expecting this to be similar with the understanding that it would be a little bit different but it is terrible! I has a very medicinal taste that I would equate to that of cough syrup which I also can't stand. I know that it is good for you but if you can't tolerate the taste then how can you take it for medicinal purposes when the time arises? I guess this has ruined me on Manuka Honey. So sad considering how good it is supposed to be for you. Guess I will stick with regular Raw Honeys.

{UPDATE} 5/14/16-After purchasing and trying this brand, I was ready to accept that all Manuka Honey probably tasted bad and that I would never like any of it because of the medicinal smell and taste. Well today I was in my local TJMaxx store and saw Manuka Doctor 20+ in the 8.75oz size and I said I would try it to see if it tasted different and if not, then I had another Manuka honey that I could use externally.  As soon as I got out to the car with the jar, I opened it and smelled it. The smell was still medicinal but not quite as strong as the YS Eco Bees Farms Manuka. Then I tasted it. I was immediately surprised!! This Manuka Honey was very good! I loved it and it was hard to put down. The color of the Manuka Doctor brand is a little lighter than the YS Eco Bees one but once I got home I then sat down and compared them side by side with a full on smell and taste test. Still I couldn't tolerate the YS Eco Bees Farm Manuka Honey, it tasted terrible to me and the Manuka Doctor one was so good in flavor. For those who cannot stand the taste of this particular Manuka Honey I would advise you to try to Manuka Doctor brand. Look for it locally if you have a TJMaxx close by. Hope this helps.. Now I am not afraid to try other Manuka Honey brands!";negative

Gross. Very bitter. A shocking amount of robusta beans used in this mix. I'm very disappointed that I didn't catch that. I read all the great reviews but I am unimpressed.

Item is being returned.  Nuts arrived in a clear plastic bag with tie-wrap type closure.

taste horrible but my step father had no problem drinking it when he found his way to it after I ran out of regular tea.

Perhaps there's inconsistency in production?";negative
Before I bought this, I read the reviews.  There were several raves and a few who said it tasted AWFUL.  Since I have always loved seaweed, I bought it.  I found it inedible.  I am definitely confused by the rave reviews.  Perhaps I got a bad batch?  It tasted like lobster bait smells.

Just made some today. I didn't use much and it brewed up super dark, which made the fact it didn't have much taste pretty odd.

My popcorn arrived today in all it's overpriced glory, and I've popped two packs of it so far. Compact, not fluffy, and more than half of the kernels don't pop in a pan, and I've been making pan popcorn for decades. The packets of oil are all leaking, and there's a hint of rancidity left behind in the pan from it. The flavor itself is stinging and chemical flavored, not butter. Very unpleasant. Worst popcorn I have ever had in my life... even JiffyPop is superior, which is scary to say.;negative

"not only does this latecomer not get it, this product is a joke! I was hoping these would be as good as or better than the original coffee single creator, Folgers (or at least that's who I heard of doing it first back in late 90's).  Maxwell House is stingy with the amount of coffee put into each bag, yielding a very weak attempt at brown water. I know the directions are based on 6-8oz servings, but who really drinks coffee in such a small quantities?  Besides, Folgers coffee singles directions are based on those same 6-8oz servings, but just like tea bags, they can stretch and sufficiently flavor much larger quantities of water(I use 2 Folgers coffee singles bags for a 22oz mug and absolutely enjoy the good, strong flavor).

In an effort not to be wasteful, I have found two solutions that work for me until the boxes are gone:

1) use one bag of this and one bag of the Folgers. Heat water to a rolling boil, pour into cup/mug over bags, wait a FULL FIVE OR SIX MINUTES, discard bags, then serve. This works for up to a 12oz cup/mug imo. Any bigger and you may want to add another bag.

2) use two or three bags of this. Place bags into pot, measure and pour in water, heat to a rolling boil, pour all into cup/mug, wait a FULL FIVE OR SIX MINUTES, discard bags, then serve. Again, assuming your cup/mug is 12oz or less.  Any bigger and you may want to add another bag.

Either method seems to work for me.  The coffee in both instances was not bitter and was at least better than instant. When these are gone though, it's back to Folgers for me! They got it right the first time and I actually enjoy the Folgers.  With Maxwell House, I'm just trying to get through the boxes.";negative
Has a bad taste;negative
I love Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  I love Jerky.  I hate to be to critical but this product for me missed the mark on both counts.  The favor was week, and for me had little resemblance to Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce.  The Jerky was a tad on the dry and crumbly side.  In an age of bold interesting flavor I was disappointed.  Really enough said.  I did have high hopes so maybe my expectations were to high.;negative
Way too many carbs.;negative
AGAVE is first ingredient in list, then stevia, so this tastes different!!  Plus, don't buy this if you're use to Now Stevia!!  Couldn't figure out why this stuff didn't sweeten my tea as Now Stevia, until I read the box.  Don't bother purchasing!;negative
"Extremely odd taste . . . this product was beyond disappointing. I'm a coffee nut, and when I add this (I've tried everything, direct and also liquified) it adds a non-cream flavor and puts an oily, slick surface on the java. This will not be a happy product for those of you who are considering replacing Cremora or some other powdered creamer with this ""natural"" product!";negative
Maybe i've been spoiled with brands like Lays, Doritos, etc and their quality control. A good 10-20% of each bag of these were inedible. Mostly bad slices of potato that shouldn't have made it into the bag. Too bad, otherwise i liked the taste.;negative
"Nothing to write home to Mom about here. The Elves have lost their touch somewhere along the line. Maybe their tree factory got hit by lightning with them in there.
Great for dog snacks and I can't figure why manufacturers don't make a cracker that has taste and plenty of filling and price it accordingly. People will pay if the product is good. Too much junk out there and these crackers are pitiful.";negative
"Sunkist Fruit Gems are always delicious, and they are made from real fruit juice. While they do have corn syrup and dyes, they are a slightly more natural choice than many candies, and they taste very fruity! Real fruit tastes better... but sometimes these are pretty hard to resist! I do hate the excessive packaging however. I shove all the wrappers into my plastic bag recycling that goes to the grocery store, but they really should come up with biodegradable wrapping like rice paper or choices that other companies use, if they even need to be individually wrapped, which I'm not sure they do as I've never had one that melted... I'm not sure it's possible.

However, this bag is not the best choice on Amazon. I made a mistake, which I didn't realize until later - currently this bag is being sold Prime for over $8/lb, while you can order 2lb bags Prime for just over $6/lb.  I initially bought it because another reviewer complained that the flavors were all Raspberry and Lemon - which I love! But that's not how it went down. Most of mine were Grapefruit, which is my least favorite!
Here are the flavors included:

*Raspberry
*Blueberry (never had before - quite good!)
*Lemon
*Orange
*Grapefruit

As another noted, there are NO lime flavor. The flavor lineup change came because Jelly Belly bought out the Fruit Gem manufacturing. I personally don't get why keep grapefruit and dump lime, which I like better - but I do think the blueberry is a good addition, and it's the only blueberry candy I've ever eaten that was not artificially colored an unnatural blue. Although they are made with fruit juice, they do use dyes too - so don't get confused, this is of course not a health food.

Check out the other bags on Amazon - Sunkist Fruit Gems are going to be the same everywhere, so make sure you're getting the cheapest deal per pound. As of right now, even though you're buying the highest bulk amount available, these are being sold well ABOVE the per lb price of 2lb bags. Just buy 2 or 3 of those, and spend less.";negative
I purchased this brand of popcorn in an 8 ounce portion pack, and loved it. This one, however, which I bought to replace when I ran out, tastes very fake and awful. I wanted to love this, but it's gross. Not the same as other Great Northern Popcorn packs!;negative
Dry. Without taste. Dry. Could not discern an oatmeal taste, nor could I discern any raisin flavoring. Did I mention these are dry? Don't waste your money. I'd send this back if it was possible after opening and trying to eat one of these dry, flavorless atrocities. Oh yeah, these are devoid of any flavor or moisture. I would not even give these to a dog.;negative
I used three of these K-cups trying to make coffee.  The seal between the top and the actual cup of the K-cup failed on all three.  If you've never had this happen, you can't imagine the mess it makes when coffee grounds are forcefully sprayed all over the area surrounding your coffeemaker.;negative
These cashews had no flavor at all and they were not fresh.  If you eat them you can't even tell what you are eating.  They look like cashews but have no flavor at all.  Very disappointed. I bought the 10 pound bag.;negative
Did absolutely NOTHING!;negative
"My husband is an energy drink addict on the weekends in his attempts to stay up all night. I thought maybe if these worked for him, he could cut down on his energy drink intake and therefore cut down on all the calories and sugar that comes with it. Unfortunately, these did absolutely nothing for him.

I tried them as well, thinking that it might just be him. I don't really drink anything with caffeine besides a coffee every few days sometimes and do not ever drink energy drinks or anything of the sort. I tried drinking one of these an hour before I would normally start getting tired at night for four nights in a row. And all four nights, I was asleep before my usual bedtime. These might work great for some people (as shown by how many good reviews these have) but they didn't have any effect on either me or my husband. Looks like my husband will be making due with his energy drinks for a while longer.";negative
I'm a popcorn gourmet but this is HORRIBLE. Was elated day I received so popped one batch in oil in pan. Very tiny kernels that only 1/2 pop & very little product when finished. This is NOT HULLLESS ( but maybe no popcorn truly is) This popcorn made my mouth so sore I couldn't eat for 2 dys & gave me terrible tummy upset--which I had to go to Dr. about. Writing Amazon about this product. Beware!! Will return  this product;negative
a little too tart for me;negative
"""Partially produced with genetic engineering"", it says right under the ingredients. There's no need for that. I'm not up on what GMO's are all about but I read science that it's a bad thing for my dog, so I avoid them. I imagine they might not be so great for me either, and so ends my interest in Snyder.";negative
Very disappointing!  Lacks flavor.  If someone told me I was drinking salted caramel flavored coffee I'd be surprised because the caramel flavor is very weak.  I thought this was going to taste great but sadly it doesn't.;negative
"I've had the White Cheddar Kernel Seasoning and it was fantastic. So, I was surprised how terrible this ""flavor"" was. Not like the tangy barbecue chip taste I was anticipating. More like sickly sweet. Not good.";negative
I am always looking for sources of protein for my teenage vegetarian son so I thought I'd try these bars - also the price was right. My kids tried them and won't ever eat them again. The texture is exactly like styrofoam. I'd have to say that the flavor is ok, it is salty but I like that. I didn't like the texture either but it is low in calories, 70 for the bar. Since I'll be eating the whole box it's good that there is something good I can say about them.;negative
VERY WEAK FLAVORING;negative
"I normally do not give these kind of products reviews based on their taste, but, god, this stuff tastes AWFUL. Tastes like cardboard. The first one you eat will be okay. But the second time won't be as great. Then the third time it will taste bad. Fast forward a couple days and you will vomit just thinking about trying to finish the box.
I'd rather have my arm broken than eat this hyena crap.";negative
I expected more chocolate in the taste for its darkness. It was not to be. In fact, it has a weaker chocolate taste than regular cocoa. I use it to make chocolate milk mix for my grandchildren, and they seem to be reasonably pleased with it. For anything else, we find a better cocoa!;negative
I would consider these more of a meal replacement bar than a snack bar, considering the calories (at least for me). And that has been the only way I eat one. They are so good, that you will not want to stop and it is a lot of calories. The spiciness of the ginger chunks is addictive. I try to only make my own snacks like these, so these are a very nice alternative to making my own. I have now also tried the peanut butter chocolate banana, YUCK. I absolutely love these three flavors together and was super excited in these bars, yuck, it tastes like coffee or burnt something. I love coffee too. I will stick with the lemon ginger which I love!;negative
I use 2 big hand-full of it into a 1/2 gal jug for hot water infusion that lasted at least half a day.  Not much taste or affect.  Could be that the product is old or next time to try boiling it first and then infuse...;negative
Sooo spicy! We are moderate spice eaters but this brand is way too spicy - so beware. The box has many packets that Im not going to be able consume. May try using 1/4 packet and mix with bottled coriander, cumin, cinnamon from McCormick or Spice Island which defeats the convenience of having a premixed package.;negative
"This is worse than the worst store bought pre-ground junk. A complete waste of money! I made the mistake of buying two bags since we drink a lot of coffee; and, we could not even drink the first bag.  We replaced it with Choc full nuts (which is poor in our opinion) from our local store and it was significantly better than this 8 o'clock.  We will be going back to the 5 lb Coffee Bean; have tried two varieties of theirs and they are decent.
As to the Taste of 8 o'clock:
Nasty, just plain Nasty! Herb pretend coffees tast more like coffee flavor than this. It is weak, lacks any pleasant flavor tones, has awful after taste and even smells bad.  It is truly bad enough to make you want to stop drinking coffee!
Do not waste your money.";negative
"My son and I both love Indian inspired food, and were excited to try this mushroom & potato masala tonight.  It smelled wonderful, and unlike many similar packaged meals the fat and sodium content were not outrageous. The mushrooms and potatoes looked better than the package. However.....

As I went to place the food into the microwave (just washed, clean, white bowl) I saw what appeared to be a long piece of dark, wiry hair attached to a clump of ....something. (I'm very blonde, and have extremely short hair.)  I checked the ingredients to see if the strand might have been something else--piece of a pepper, perhaps--and asked another adult for their opinion.  We regretfully decided it was hair, and tossed the food.  No idea what the dark chunk attached to the possible hair was, but I washed my hands several times in HOT water.

I'm not sure what to do with the remaining packages, but I don't think I will be able to bring myself to open another one.  I know this sort of thing can happen at restaurants or with any prepared food, but felt compelled to at least give a heads up to other potential buyers.";negative
The volume is less than I anticipated, and so I find it too expensive.  It also has too much sugar in it for my household.  I am accustomed to Larabars, and was hoping this nut mix would be comparable. But it is not.  I will not be ordering it again.;negative
"I don't understand the rave reviews. This stuff was NASTY. It didn't even taste as good as the $7 bottle of olive oil you can buy at Trader Joe's. It didn't taste like olive oil at all. It tasted like canola oil, only bitter. And the price is RIDICULOUS. Right after I bought this, I saw it on clearance at my local grocery store for $5 (probably because they were trying to get rid of it because it tasted so nasty; I checked the date the bottles on clearance weren't even close to their expiration date). Since there was no way I was ruining a salad with this stuff, I asked for a refund. Seriously, save your money.";negative
"I've been a big fan of Mangoes.  I've been eating mangoes since I was 3, at least that's the earliest I recall eating mangoes.  I'm a mango fanatic and have enjoyed so many different varieties of mangoes.

I ordered this one to make smoothies, but when I ate a few pieces, I realized this tastes so different.  Doesn't even taste like mango.  Maybe I received a bad case, but the taste was so bad, it's been sitting in the pantry for many months now. :(

I wouldn't buy it again.";negative
I lived off their juice (even though it was $7 a bottle but it was oooh so good lol) but then my Walmart stopped carrying it. :( Decided to try what I thought would be the powdered form instead. I followed the directions, added a scoop to my coconut water and shook it...and shook it...and shook it. I even let it sit to dissolve. It stayed the same. Is it *supposed* to be like this?? May be better in a smoothie in the Vitamix or something as far a getting any type of benefit from consuming it . I was not impressed with the taste either - honestly I don't know WHAT it tasted like. I just had to eat it out of the bottom of my drink bottle like grinds but there was no taste. Not what I was expecting. At.all. I can't believe this. :(;negative
I love Yogi teas and was excited to try this brand, since I love the Vanilla Spice Perfect Energy tea. Fruit-flavored teas are my favorite, but it's hard to find a version that's caffeinated. Unfortunately, this was a miss for me. It tasted mildly like raspberries, but there was also a piney taste that didn't even allow me to finish my cup. I looked at the ingredients to try to figure it out - maybe it's the sage? Unfortunately, I will not be repurchasing.;negative
this is a glass jar that was shipped to me in a thin postal bag, not wrapped in anything, needless to say it was shashed to smitherines and leaking all over the place. And the smell, what was left that was all over the place smelt bad like a little manuerish ! Um yeah it made its way to the trash can and it stains everything;negative
Product itself is not bad but the container barely comes with any product in it.  Less than a quarter full.  Misleading and way overpriced for what you get.  If container was full, this would have been a 5 star review.;negative
Very disappointed in this product.  Could not find the beef granules I'd used for so many years.  This product does not add a good flavor to my dishes.  In fact, it adds a strange flavor which I do not like.  Bought this to share with a friend (2 jars each) and both of us are discarding them as unacceptable for our use.;negative
It died after a long struggle.;negative
Didnt have a label on it.;negative
"There is most definitely an aftertaste. I'm used to Splenda and miss it. Still investigating its effects and hoping its not the killer that its been portrayed to be. I really wanted to love this Stevia but I've just had coffee and as strong as coffee is I can still taste the Stevia.  This has nothing to do with ""NOW"" as I really like their products...it's just Stevia overall. If you don't taste the after taste then you are lucky. I wish I didn't.";negative
Probably the worst creamer I have ever tasted and very expensive for the little dab you get. So now I have two bags of this disgusting stuff. The glowing reviews must have taste buds that drastically differ from mine. To me, this creamer has a weird metallic, unsweetened,  over ripe pumpkin taste that just makes my stomach turn. It lingers like a sour thickness on the tongue even after you rinse your mouth out.;negative
I think these were old even though I couldn't find an expiration date. The gravy was very thick and it was all mushy. I've had them from the grocery store and they were good. The consistency was very different.;negative
Almonds are not crispy. Very soft and even feel like they are stale, old. Checked but can not find a use by date. I thought they had to print that. Anyway, I passed them off to a friend that didn't care. Next time stay with Blue Diamond.;negative
I have purchased 3 other varieties of nuts from The Peanut Shop and monthly receive a can of the Habanero flavor on a subscribe and save basis, but sadly these nuts are awful.  They are so salty they are inedible. My husband, who eats all of these nuts, complained how salty they were and asked me to try one.  I only ate one half of one peanut and I could barely finish it.;negative
I did not like the medium roast compared to koffee kult's dark roast. The beans of this medium roast were really small, almost like little split peas compared to the bean size I think is normal. There is no oil and shine to the beans. No matter how much or little beans I brind (burr grinder of course), I can't get a nice smooth brew - just really acidic and sour tasting. That might be your thing, but for me, these didn't work out.;negative
hard to eat;negative
"I would consider this very herbal rather than spice. The rose hips are a bit strong to my liking.
I would also prefer a stronger cinnamon and orange spice flavor. I added a little bit of liquid stevia and it helps a tad, but the aroma of the rose hips is so strong that overwhelms the rest
I will try to add more next time but I have a feeling it is just going to increase the rose hips flavor.

I would consider this a swing and a miss.

*Update* I am now considering it a total failure. I even picked out many of the rose hips and it still doesn't have what I would consider a Herbal Orange Spice flavor";negative
One of the packages was not sealed properly and popcorn spilled out of the box when I opened it.  I didn't request a replacement because, after trying it, I didn't care for the popcorn.  It's not this product in particular - I think it's white popcorn in general.  It's much smaller than yellow popcorn and doesn't pop as well.;negative
"i received my 6 tubs of peanuts today, and the containers and packaging were more than satisfactory. i wish i could say the same for the peanuts.

they taste funny...and greasy and half raw. and, i can't return the unopened tubs. so i guess i'll have to boil them to get the oil off then mix them into oatmeal or cottage cheese to disguise the off-taste,

or maybe i'll just feed them to the squirrels.";negative
Not crazy about these;negative
Bought unwittingly because they threw Ceylon into the title of this cinnamon.  It has a pungent smell, unlike Ceylon cinnamon which lead me to do some research.  The pungent smell, the dark color, and the fact that it is Indian cinnamon prove that it is indeed not Ceylon cinnamon.  False advertising.  I'm going to try to return.;negative
"I was excited to get these, because Brazil nuts are my favorite.  I opened the bag, popped one in my mouth and spit it out. It did not taste good at all. Tried another and it was not as bad, but not good.  My daughter thought they were disgusting.  I tried about 6 nuts and every nut had a different flavor - none of them good.

I would not have bought these,  if I had realized they were not returnable.

Better nuts were: Oh Nuts! Jumbo Brazil Nuts.";negative
Did not taste good;negative
"Amazon's excellent customer service allowed me to receive a replacement box of these crackers when I started opening the bags and finding tiny pieces of crackers.

However, the second box came exactly the same way.

The taste of the Original crackers is a lot like a water cracker. Not much to it but it's absolutely perfect for whatever topping or filling you're using.

I would order them constantly if they were not all broken upon arrival.";negative
Due to the low price and good reviews, we thought we'd give this 'balsamic' vinegar a try.  Don't waste your money.  Our standards are pretty low as far as vinegar goes, I mean how much can 'balsamic' vary, right?  We were wrong.  It is red wine vinegar at best.  Very thin, and does not have that savory sweetness like most balsamic vinegars have.  Look elsewhere unless you are looking for red wine vinegar.;negative
The Tulsi Signature Blend was pretty off putting. The flavor was overly peppery (peppery tea? Yuck).  It  had too many contrasting flavors that made it a chore to drink. And I enjoy many different kinds of tea.  This was a rare miss for me.;negative
It's so bitter and grainy. It was like eating old coffee grounds. I have never spit out chocolate before, but I could not eat this. It's definitely not my kind of chocolate at all. I had never had stone ground chocolate and honestly, I had no idea there was such a thing. It's grainy like large chunks of sand, if you're looking for smooth chocolate that will melt in your mouth then you will not like this.;negative
I am so sorry to have to rate this product so negatively. I drink coconut water every day, and was hoping to get around having to ship or carry water. This tasted so bad, it made me gag. It tasted soapy and salty, just like my recent colonoscopy prep. I tried adding some sugar, but it didn't help at all. Very disappointed. It is one of the few times I have had to ask Amazon for a refund. Save Amazon and yourself some money and time, unless you are willing to add this to something really strong. Then it might taste like Gator-ade. Ick.;negative
A poor taste and texture.;negative
I've only made one cup of this coffee and could not stand another.  It is some of the worst coffee I've ever tasted. I have such good memories of having had coffee and Begnets at the Cafe Du Monde in years gone by.;negative
"I wasn't paying attention and paid .50 each when the label has a retail price of .25!

I'm not blaming Amazon because it was a fulfillment through warehouse, I'm blaming myself so don't make the same mistake some of us have made";negative
"WOOOOOOOW....

Amazon doesn't allow me to give this product a 1 star review no matter WHAT I WRITE! Now I am FORCED to give this horrible product 2 stars.

**update**
finally, it went through!

this product taste horrible. just bad overall which i can't mention because if i do, this review will get removed.";negative
not my flavor. misordered.;negative
"So bummed I got a bad batch. The last large container of this brand's oil was delicious--probably one of my all time fave coconut oils. The last one? You can smell it when its bad; its pretty plain to tell. The good stuff smells simply like coconut, light and aromatic. The bad stuff has this slight acrid scent that's unmistakeable. Luckily Amazon refunded it but now, I feel cautious buying another one. If it's bad too, at some point I look suspicious, not the company...like I'm trying to score free coconut oil.

POSTSCRIPT: I got another container. It came in a beat-up box with a cracked lid. The oil isn't bad but still has the slightest funky smell. Lesson learned? Some things are better bought in a store. It's a big container of delicate oil sitting in lord knows how many trucks, etc. for hot hour after hour.";negative
This is NOT a loose leaf tea.  More like tea dust.  I like Twinings just fine and like to have some standard black tea around so that if I buy a flavored tea that is too strong in flavor, I can mix with unflavored black.  The crumbs in this canister were so bad I had to go out and buy tea bags.  It cannot be used in an infuser.  It is also noticeable that the flavor is far weaker than the Irish Breakfast tea they sell in the bags.  Nearly worthless as a loose leaf tea.  Wish I hadn't purchased.;negative
I ordered this and tried several cups. It was so watery and tasteless. Not only did I have to pay shipping for this and the Vanilla-flavored packages I purchased for over $60, I now have to pay shipping to return it and they  won't credit me for the opened package which I'll need to throw out.;negative
i actually don't really care for this stuff too much. I got it because the local chinese place doesn't give us enough sauce with take-out, but this is way saltier than their stuff. Same basic flavor but just too much of it. Wife likes it but not my cup of tea.;negative
"The salt substitute that is used for this is noxious. I wish they had included the spices but just left the fake salt out.

My family really likes the flavor of regular Cavender's, but it is high in sodium and contains MSG. :(

If you have had potassium chloride products before and don't mind the taste, you may not have any problem with this, but I just absolutely hated it.";negative
unfortunately, the twinings earl grey tea in this entire shipment of six boxes was STALE.  the bergamot scent almost entirely absent.  the tea leaves flat and bitter.  either the warehousing was improper or twinings has become a very poor purveyor of teas.  i am beginning to think the latter. sadly. nick patricca tea lover;negative
I love taro flavor for my bubble tea drinks , I was very hopeful about this product initially ,  but disappointed on the taste . I don't think I'll even use the the rest of the bag, which is a waste . Glad I got the smallest size .  I've definitely had better . I'll keep looking and not order this one again .  This tasted strange to me and not a rich taro flavor .;negative
"These chestnuts do not taste anything like ""chestnuts"".  In fact they don't taste like anything at all.  I will order fresh chestnuts grown in the US and roast them myself.  Amazon was very responsive to my complaint.  Thank you Amazom for listening to your customers.";negative
This tea smells like ginger root, but it does not taste like ginger tea made with fresh ginger root or made with other ginger products.  The flavor reminds me of chemicals.  Also the tea bags do not cost seven cents each as the listing indicates.  Each tea bag cost forty cents and provides a weak cup of odd tasting tea, even if steeped for 15 minutes as the package suggests. I will buy Stash Ginger with Lemon in the future.;negative
Was I supposed to get 4 bags. I only got 1 bag and it was open and all over the box.i have found much better buy around the holidays. Most good grocery stores are loaded up with all the specialty flours for pasta at way more economical price. This same quality flour for $2.99 for same amount of $. I had purchased this thinking there were 4 bags and only got one. And it was all over box. They didn't even tape it shut.;negative
Sadly, another low score.  These did not look anything like the picture on the package.  There was almost no strawberry and the grain was very thick and not appetizing looking or tasting .  Took two bites and threw them out.  I never throw out food.  I would not torture myself by forcing myself to eat these.;negative
"So not worth the money....Tasted like ultra cheap grade B candy you would find at dollar stores.
Chocolate was waxy and had no flavor at all!
Soft center chocolates had funny texture (not creamy at all, more like gooey plastic) and they all tasted the same.
Do yourself a favor and get See's candies....(those are AWESOME).";negative
eh...;negative
I have been on a pickled vegetable kick as of late, buying every kind I can find since I discovered how much I love pickled okra-- a vegetable I usually can't stand.  I really wanted to love these, but I didn't at all. :(  They were definitely not crispy, and were actually quite soft.  I like freshly cooked asparagus, but these, for some reason, were just not good.  I tried to make myself finish at least the one jar I had opened, having given the other 2 away. But I gave up, and dumped them.;negative
best by date is May 16, 2016 I did not bother to read the best by date when I bought the taco kit on March 29, 2016 why would I right?  the price was $2.60 what a bargain I thought!  opened the box and found 90% of taco shells were in pieces!!  the taco shells/chips were stale and was unable to eat them. sorely disappointed;negative
"Maybe if they were cut thinner they wouldn't be quite so hard and sharp to chew. But otherwise they're fair. I don't like using palm oil, doing paleo. Somehow I thought these were paleo, maybe it was another brand. Red palm oil retains nutrients. This ingredient list doesn't not say ""Red"" nor does it say: palm Kernel oil.";negative
NO FLAVOR;negative
This Yogurt Starter is NO GOOD!  It is old and has gold crystals inside each packet (thinking powder is what it used to be??).  I have tried 3 times and each time my yogurt came out totally THIN & UNSET.  Had to throw it away and that cost me 1.5 gallons of milk.  Trying to contact Vendor to get a refund but unsuccessful so far.  DO NOT USE THIS VENDOR AS THE PRODUCT HERE IS BAD!  There are several bad reviews and one actually shows the picture of what is inside each packet that was the same for me.;negative
I'm sad that I purchased and entire box I will never get through it, I will have to give some away to friends and family. The taste is alright, but does not compare to regular chai tea, even if you steep it for several minutes it still tastes too watered down. The aroma is nice, but it does not taste like it smells.;negative
Says genetically modified on the package.  Tastes delicious but just doesn't seem worth it to me, even if the genetic modification is nothing of consequence.  I'll buy an organic product next time because of well, the liberal media (just kidding about the reason why!);negative
These crackers taste great and we like that they are organic. However, the texture is too soft to make it through shipping. We buy and enjoy other Late July products at the local branch of a popular grocery store that features lots of imports and organics, such as their cheese flavored and whole grain crackers. Perhaps if that store carried this type they'd be okay to purchase from there, but when we opened the case of these that arrived on our doorstep from Amazon, about half the crackers in each box had been reduced to fine crumbs during shipping.;negative
"I hate to be the only dissenter here but these are not the kind we used to buy in the sixties.

They look the same but the texture is different. Now I admit I know nothing about the candy business or how bubble gum is made but I do know companies use filler and often cheaper ingredients to make more money.

The old type you could bite off a hunk and wind up with a wad of bubble gum roughly the size you bit off. And the more you chewed the softer it got.

These Bubble Cigars once you have chewed them for about a minute turns into a small lump a quarter of the size you put in your mouth and the lump is so tough you have to spit it out- it is just too tough to chew. Like a piece of hard rubber.

I admit they look the same and the flavor is close to the sixties but they are not anywhere near the quality of what we used to buy. The old kind you could chew for hours, blow bubbles with , and the flavor would last as long as you chewed.
These will do none of that.

They just seem to be made from very cheap ingredients with about 70% filler.

It's a shame because they used to be really good. But these are not what we grew up with.
It is very cheap bubble gum made in the color and the shape of the old Bubble Gum Cigars many of us used to love.

Fortunately, they do not cost very much so you can try them yourself without being out too much money.";negative
At the time I purchased this, the description said this was a 24 pack.  It turned out to be a 1 pack with 24 tea bags, very disappointing.  Tea bags cannot be purchased individually so this cannot be considered a 24 pack.;negative
"There's a very good reason for the disclaimer on this website.  These pumpkin seeds are imported from China (!) by a company called Yankee Traders.  Ignore the fact they're called ""pepitas"" which made me think they might be from Mexico, if imported (which wasn't mentioned, either).  Then there's the label which mentions that these seeds are processed in a facility that ""also processes products containing peanuts, tree nuts, soy, fish, milk, egg, crustacean shellfish and wheat ingredients.""  I'm not allergic to any of those, but nonetheless after consuming about a half cup of these as a snack in the afternooon and at bedtime, I woke up with a headache, upset digestive system and other unpleasantness. Considering all the accusations regarding poisoned pet and for-human products that are Chinese-grown, made or processed, which have been in the news over the last few years, I can't help but worry about these seeds.  I guess that's what I get for not wearing my glasses to examine the label carefully before consuming a new product.  So much for healthy snacking -- you shouldn't buy these if you do have allergies, or if you have concerns about Chinese food-related imports.";negative
These are a big disappointment to me. I am used to the Atlantic City Boardwalk salt water taffy and these just don't compare. There is something about them that is lacking. I can't put my finger on it, but am going to search for the 'original' AC Boardwalk taffy. I have moved to NW PA and there's no way I can justify driving back to AC for taffy, and my budget can't afford any more casino visits - lol.;negative
Great product. Great service.;negative
Taste like paper and much too tiny.;negative
I was expecting some really good tea based on the reviews I read but that is not what I got.  First of all, it came without any manufacturers seal on the tea bags.  They came in a ziplock bag.  That should have been my first clue to pitch them.  I opened the bag and was greeted by a rancid smell that had nothing coconut about it.  Very disappointed.  Amazon made it right for me and I tossed the whole ziplock of bags.  I will never order this brand of tea again.;negative
probably would not buy again;negative
"I think I am being generous by giving it 1 star, it deserves none. The seeds are terrible, they are soft & taste slightly bitter. It's almost like they are old & have been left out in d open for days. Unfortunately I opened the pack & emptied it out but did not get the time to return it. Now I am stuck with loads of useless fennel seeds. I get much better ones at other grocery stores especially Indian grocery stores.

Update: Like another reviewer I too suffered a loss of taste for months & it felt like I will never be able to taste anything ever again. Thankfully it's over & I will never buy it again. Don't understand what's the problem with it. Even today I don't recommend it.";negative
Well, they are not YELLOW and they did not come with the balloon at the bottom of the stems so the pedals had started wilting.  This was not the Valentines Day roses that I planned on them receiving.  Very disappointed.;negative
This used to be the best hibiscus tea ever and my recent shipment is horrible!  I've ordered this several times and I used to get nice big pieces that were soft now it's dry and crumbly. I didn't even bother to open the bag it looks so terrible. What happened??? I am so disappointed. I'm sending it back.;negative
It has the proper look to the rice crackers you get in popular mixes but the flavor is closer to dust and the texture is hard / brittle like glass not like those delicious cracker bits you eat first in the common mix. But they look perfect hence two vs one star;negative
UGH!  What an aftertaste!  I only used a very small amount mixed in with my other sugar substitutes to make 3 cups needed for my recipe, but that awful taste permeated the entire end product!  I will never use it again!  Also, that brown color overwhelmed the end product as well.;negative
"Best sea salt ever. I've been using it for years and each time I try a different one because I can't find it in local stores, I'm disappointed at the taste, consistency or quality of the other salts out there (except maybe good-quality Himalayan pink salt).

However, four out of six salt containers arrived with broken/torn bottoms and most of the salt was in the packaging, rendering it unsuitable for cooking purposes.

$30 is a steep price for two containers of salt. I will contact the seller and report back.";negative
Do not buy....comes from CHINA;negative
"I love Asian food. This however is some sort of conspiracy to induce Gaijin to ingest raw sewage packaged in plastic. Everything was acceptable all the way through opening the package, adding the ""dry vegetable"" and boiling water. Then came ""spice packet"". Soon there was an odor. And not a pleasant one. This was further befouled when I added the ""mustard mayonnaise"" package. At this point I had before me a plastic bowl of putrescence. Nevertheless I braved on and swallowed several globules of the creamy brown material...and gagged. Caveat emptor!";negative
I had to use a lot to lighten my coffee to the color I like- but then it was odd tasting. I tried two cups of coffee with differing amounts of the nutpods creamer. The second time I used less but the color of my coffee was unappealing. Using less did reduce the odd flavor but I just couldn't  love it- and I *really* wanted to. I ended up tossing the remainder of the opened pod and giving the other three containers away.;negative
"Maltesers are fantastic, but I wouldn't buy any food from Amazon ever again.  I've read too many reviews about stale food, and wow, this was about as stale as they come!  I tried eating them anyway, but after I got them, found them for sale in a store.  Wow!  What a difference!  These were terribly stale from Amazon, and I would be VERY hesitant about buying ANY food from amazon ever again.

UPDATE 2/2013: Since this time I've ordered a few other food products from Amazon and been happy. Maybe a fluke with the ones I got (or the Maltesers in general).  Just had to clarify, since I can't say that all food on Amazon is stale.

UPDATE 7/2013: Have since ordered a LOT more stuff from Amazon, and realized that the seller probably had more to do with the staleness. Bought in Oct 2009 from Nutricity.  I'm not saying they're a bad company, but in 2009 they had some stale product.";negative
Still hard after soaking;negative
"This is very weak compared to Liption Diet Iced Tea Mix, Lemon.  For a 32oz cup, I need 4-5 tablespoons (70-75 ml of powder) to have a moderately strong drink.  Compare to 2 tablespoons (28-30ml) for the lemon drink.

The peach flavor is very mild even at the stronger level, and the tea is not as dark.  The jar says 10 quarts, but I guess my expectation for strength puts it at half that.

For peach tea, I recommend Diet Snapple Peach Singles.  One packet will do a 24oz bottle, and 1.5 packets will do a 32oz cup pretty strong.  Amazon's version is twelve 6-packs of the Snapple Singles for twelve dollars, and that provides 54 quarts of strong tea, vs Lipton at eighteen dollars for 40 quarts of weak tea.";negative
"ordered ""C+H, Cane Sugar, Golden Brown, 2lb (Pack of 2)"". mainly to try on pork as part of a dry rub; instead of the resealable package(s) as noted I received one gray generic package mainly identified with a magic marker ""X"" (another magic marker mark covered over) and not resealable; haven't even opened it yet, the product could be anything, from anybody, or it could be useable but need repackaging to save the remainder after first use; and did it mean two one pound packages or two two pound packages (4 lbs) which is what the price would indicate; not very happy with Amazon about this!";negative
"I have purchased the 5 pound bag of Spicy World Citric Acid in the past with no issues.  So this last time, I ordered the 10 pound bag since the cost was even better in the larger quantity.
This citric acid has to be old.  I teach classes on cheese making.  I use this for making mozarella cheese.  My last few classes (18 people attended) our mozarella cheese came out too soft. When making the small mozarella balls, they ""melted"" on the trays.  I tried making different batches checking all my chemicals to make sure they were good.  The last thing I tried was making this with different citric acid.  It worked.  This 10lb bag was bad. Citric acid lasts a very long time, so I am guessing this size of bag had been sitting for awhile.  Disappointed.";negative
"I'm a big flavored coffee fan, and I don't really like strong coffee either, but even I find these flavors weak, weak, weak.  I can barely taste either the coffee or the flavoring, and even when a cup is brewing, the smell doesn't rise and fill the room.  Honestly, the flavored coffee from Folger's and Millstone (available at the grocery store) are better.

On the positive side, I did receive these in less than a week from ordering.  There was also a good mix of flavors in both packs (you get 44 K-cups in all), and the packages were in good condition when I received them.";negative
Dry. Crumbly. Tasteless.;negative
Tastes horrible...Yuck!;negative
"Product count was not accurate.  I only received 47 K-cups instead of 48.  Also it is pictured in original packaging but the cups are loose in a plain brown box.  This doesn't allow you to see the ""best by"" date, so you have no way of knowing if the tea is fresh.";negative
Didn't like taste at all;negative
"I buy Torani Classic Caramel Syrup often; I love it in iced coffee. This doesn't taste like it normally does. My father-in-law purchased this one for me from my Amazon wishlist, whereas I would normally buy it from World Market.
This one came in a plastic bottle instead of the glass bottle I've always gotten before, despite the description specifically stating it would be a glass bottle, and has a horrible alcohol aftertaste. Pretty sure I won't be able to drink all of this stuff because of the taste.
Not sure if the bottle difference is the reason for the taste difference, but I've never had this problem with the glass bottle syrup.";negative
"It's called a ""medium"" but in America it could be called a ""hot"". Too spicy for me. It's hotter then Tabasco and that's the limit of hotness that I enjoy. The spiciness overpowers any garlic flavor for me. I wish Lee and Perrins still made their garlic sauce because it was awesome.";negative
After tasting these crackers, I looked at the date on the box and it read 03 NOV17th.  I am OUTRAGED that these would be sooooo old.  I have eaten these before, but the box I received hardley had a cheese taste to them, and the crunch seemed old.  I demand my money back.;negative
This is advertised as 40 varieties of coffee. Some may say, yeah, there are 40 different k-cup pods in here but come on... How many versions of medium roast coffee can you have. There's Brooklyn medium roast, real tree medium roast, Brooklyn breakfast, blah blah medium, blah blah breakfast. Take a good look at the picture. 90% of the coffee include is medium roast coffee. No actual flavors. Just coffee flavor. Now I'm not saying that this is bad medium roast coffee. Actually it's quite good, but to advertise this as a variety pack is just wrong. That is the reason for the 1 star rating. Because of switch and bait. If I wanted medium roast I'd just buy medium roast. So just know what you are looking at here. It's 40 pods of medium roast coffee with a variety of different stickers on them.;negative
NOT for me!! Weirdest taste ever!;negative
"Recently bought this product with the hopes of makes a no calories added pumpkin flavored latte.  With a great imagination & super sense of smell you may like this product.

Rancid oil of bergamot. 3 hours now and cannot get the foul taste out of my mouth, so I'm writing this review. Every negative review on this tea complains about a chemical lemony taste. Well, I would have to agree only I know that the foul aftertaste is from an oxidized oil. Try Numi Earl Gray organic tea--it's real bergamot leaf and not an extract oil so no chance of rancidity.;negative
I have to be honest I really thought these would be good I like starburst but these taste like bad medicine and it was expensive I didn't know when I purchased them buy I could have gotten these at a local store for half the price I paid here.  These were really disappointing.;negative
"Well, compared to the miso soups I have had in sushi restaurants, even compared to the Kikkoman Shiro Miso Soup.... This one does not taste like anything like them. It has a strong salty taste. I had to really force myself to finish the cup. Now I have 23 envelopes left and don't really feel like eating them.

I was so excited to find a all natural miso soup without conservants... But this taste is just not for me. Maybe it is the ""real"" miso soup, but as I said, it does not taste like any miso soup I have ever tried before.

Recommendation: try a smaller pack first to see if you like it before you buy the 24 pack!";negative
Wouldn't recommend. I love the tiger nut flour and use it weekly. However, the actual Tiger Nuts as a snack wasn't something that I enjoyed. They tasted like hard, dry cardboard to me. I tried soaking them in water to see if it would help bring out more flavor and it didn't.;negative
"My husband and I bought an ""Annies"" mac and cheese one night at our local store.  It was amazing, and we were so excited that we decided to buy a large lot online.  I couldn't find the exact style we bought, but the lable on this box was almost identical to the other Annies.  I was WRONG, this was awful - the cheese was a powder instead of the pre-mixed packet that came in our original box.  It was watery and smelled like vomit.  It left a bad after-taste.  I do not recommend this particular type of Annies.";negative
"We have ordered cases of the Sea Salt/Olive Oil chips and they have been well liked.  A good balance of crisp, salt, oil flavor and appearance of pale yellow potato like chips.  Decided to try the ""kettle"" version.  HOW AWFUL!  These chips are overly geasy.  They taste of stale olive oil.  There is no freshness date, no manufacture date, no expiration date on any of the bags, anywhere.  This case of chips was completely un like the regular olive oil/sea salt version. .  The chips were greasy to feel, oily in appearance, so oily they were transparent and looked like oiled sponges.  I don't know if this was just a bad batch, poor qualilty control or simply the off taste of a bad product.  I WILL NOT ORDER THE KETTLE VERSION AND DO NOT RECOMMEND THEM AS WORTH THE COST.  Such a shame, when most people at least did not feel quite so bad eating what seemed a more healthy chip.  Now they look so saturated with oil that no one would eat them.  THE REGULAR OLIVE OIL WITH SEA SALT ARE SO MUCH  BUY THEM INSTEAD OF THESE
BETTER, FLAVOR, SALT LEVEL AND LACK OF GREASINESS";negative
There is a whiff of cherry flavor in these candies, a decided downturn from what they once were a few years ago.  Haribo seems to have cut production costs to keep down the cost of the candies.  Too bad.  The public will pay more for a good product.  Some of the other European imported gummies far exceed Haribo in flavor and texture.;negative
Some of the packages i ordered had actually expired & they had just stuck a label over the top with a different date...not impressed. I had ordered this previously & liked it so ordered again but they were expired...gross!!!;negative

"Yes, people will like Pamela's gluten free bread mix.  I did too BUT do the math on the very high amount to sweetener in this mix.  9 grams per slice (based on their stated 16 slices per loaf)!  This is 144 grams for the loaf which comes to 1 1/4 cups of sweetener.  As you know that's 15 tablespoons in the mix (approximately) so compare that to your favorite recipes.  I see no one else coming even close to this in mixes or recipes.  I can't think of any reason they are doing this except for taste - to make it more sellable.  Just a heads up since we need to be cutting back on sugars not ramping up.

Okay.;negative
this is very disappointing to say the least..  I just got it was excited to try it in my coffee it has no smell no taste absolutely nothing ..i used a whole teaspoon and stopped still nothing at all.  You cannot believe any of the review listed thats for sure. I am so disappointed its unreal..;negative
After using the normal Ideal sweetener for many things, I ordered this in the hopes that it would replace some/all of the brown sugar in cookies and such.  For some reason, I just can't get anything I make with this stuff to taste right.  I've never used another brown sugar substitute, but I wasn't terribly impressed with this one;negative
I take these to work for breakfast & lunch, and I love the Lentil Couscous & Split Pea ones so much that I figured I would give this one a try... I will not be ordering it again. It is okay, but kind of bland, even with crushed red pepper added, and the rice is weird to me. It also has kind of a fake lime flavor, which I don't really like. I am pretty bummed out about it because I really would love to find a great vegan tortilla soup. Oh well.;negative
Funny taste. Boxes are significantly smaller than the originals. Not so fresh. Prizes in box are just directions for an internet download. Was very disappointed. This is definitely the Cracker Jacks I had as a kid. Ate 1 box. Threw the rest away.;negative
"I ordered from this seller as the K-Cups WERE SHOWN AND ADVERTISED AS ""EXTRA BOLD"" - showing the ALL GREEN Cap that clearly indicates this.  However, when I received the K-Cups, ALL HAD THE WHITE RING AROUND THE COVER (indicating it was NOT the X-TRA BOLD), and NOWHERE on the covers does it indicate X-TRA BOLD!

I made 16 ou coffee cups, so already have to add some instant coffee to my cup to make a nice, reasonably strong cup of coffee at that size.  Since the cups I received have LESS COFFEE in them because they are NOT EXTRA BOLD, I'll now have to add even more instant - making my total cost more.

So do NOT BUY from Discount Brewers if you want X-TRA BOLD!";negative
I wanted to add more protein to my diet and thought this was the answer...wrong.  I had high hopes for this protein as it is both gluten and lactose free (difficult as I can't gave either) but it is disgusting.  I used this for the 1st time and added it to my morning shake of Amazing Grass Chocolate Green SuperFood, almond milk and 1T PB2 powdered peanut butter, which I love and look forward to drinking every morning.  This protein powder is so gritty I had to chug it down.  The rest will be going into the trash.  I would not recommend this protein powder to anyone.  Yuck!;negative
"Lots of good reviews, but some people complaining about staleness. Could they be right? I love these bars (usually buy them from Costco), but during the  pre-Thanksgiving rush, I opted to buy these online instead of braving the crowds. How bad could it be?

Stale.

Not bad enough for me to toss, but let's just say I'm happy that box is done and I'm back on the Costco boxes! So the details - I tried the last (online) bar today right along side a new Costco bar. The online bar was harder, bit stale tasting (the sugar was subdued) and the nuts were not as robust in flavor. Just seemed a bit unflavored. I hesitate to say, cardboardish.

I won't be buying these again.

Now a review of the bars (general, not buyer specific). AMAZING. Love the flavors and light sugar taste. Also love that there are no sugar alcohols or artificial sweeteners and still low sugar count. I used to buy the Nugo Slim bar exclusively and have added these to the mix.";negative
Tasty but not very soft;negative
"First tried on popcorn ... Nope.

Then tried mac n cheese ... Nope

Then we tried mac n cheese again, a little different ... Better, but still no good.

This stuff just doesn't have any FLAVOR. It's bright and colorful like that ridiculous processed nonsense we all know and love, and the label even says it's made by the same mfg, so ya might think this would be the same ... but it isn't.

I really wanted to love this stuff but my atherosclerotic tendencies demand more flavor. If you're gonna clog 'em, clog 'em tasty. That's what my doctor says anyway.";negative
Love these but all were broken.;negative
"Looks-wise these are great for making herbal tea, and also to use in homemade bath salts. However, the description says they are ""fragrant"" which they are definitely not. Mine did not smell whatsoever, if anything they slightly smelled like stems, but zero flower smell is there. Very disappointed!";negative
Very confusing!  The label states 8 Carbs with 2 Fiber... So, you think 6 net carbs isn't too shabby.  Then you see there are 12 servings.  Huh?  Is that a misprint?  The jerky tastes like really cheapo, horribly processed jerky.  Think of gas station jerky...only softer and icky.  Plus, it is not very clear on the description that these are a split package of a small amount of jerky and another side of a small amount of stale nuts.  I have learned from the other EPIC products that I have tried that these are just really nicely packaged products with very poor quality meats.  To me the smell like dog food.  And the texture is about as bad!  Really expensive too!  Just buy the best salami or beef jerky and pass on these.  You will save money and actually enjoy your snacking.;negative
No taste.;negative
"I suppose the offering says ""tea"" and not ""tea leaves,"" but this is tea dust.  Nothing close to a whole leaf to be seen in the whole package.  No complexity to the chai spices.  Very disappointing, I wouldn't order again.";negative
"We bought this after reading the positive reviews.  This is not an attack on any of the reviews or reviewers but we don't think this drink has any redeeming qualities.  Since it is sold as Cappuccino, we expected it to taste like Cappuccino.  It does not.  It is sickeningly sweet with phony tasting toffee flavoring and very strong aroma.  This product appears to have little to do with coffee and a lot to do with sugar.  The serving size (portion) is 35 grams.  Of that 35 grams, 20 grams is sugar (the first ingredient in the ingredients list).  (FYI, it also contains 3.5 grams of fat and 140 calories per portion).  Instant coffee is listed near the bottom of the ingredients list.  If you love coffee and/or cappuccino you may want to steer clear of this product. We tried it one time and discarded the rest.  We hope this helps.  Cheers

"Not too smooth and left a bad aftertaste; worst part, weeks later, can still taste this stuff. Perhaps the non-organic coffee's are using McDonald's style of enhancing flavors (unhealthy man-made chemicals which do nothing good to the body) of which makes the real-thing taste bad. I do not know but certainly was not impressed /";negative
"What I ordered was the ""French Roast"" flavor. What I received said it was French Roast flavor. However, upon opening, it smelled and tasted strongly of MINT.

these were the worst flavored sardines I HAVE EVER TASTED. this is the 1st time I ever saw a white mustard sauce that had a horrible taste.  I honestly think they were bad.  I will stick with Crown Prince Bristling Sardines in mustard sauce. Even my cat wouldn't eat these.  The only thing I can say good about these they were big but again I have to say very tasteless.;negative

Too oily.  My last order came in and each jar had to be wiped down .  The jars were not opened, but the outside of each jar was covered in oil.  Not to mention the product itself is too oily and runny.  Not at all like the Teddie Peanut butter I remember.  I have cancelled my future orders.;negative
i bought this coffee once before and loved its flavor and aroma, but this time it seems like the quality has taken a dive. the coffee was pretty offal, it lacked flavor and body, its sad that i prefer brands like folgers over this.;negative
"I KNOW they say these are a super food. I KNOW they're supposed to be crazy good for you. But so far- no matter what I do or try them with... they just taste like funny beef jerky to me.  I even LIKE beef jerky, but man... I can't wrap my mind around the taste of these.

I've not given up on them yet... and if I find the magic recipe, I will CERTAINLY revise my review.

Please read this knowing this is the only brand of these I've tried. I plan to purchase an additional type and see if there's a difference, or if this is one of the very, very few foods in the world I just don't like.";negative

I've made tea with the Stash Moroccan Mint Green four times now and it not only doesn't have the mint flavor, it doesn't have much of a green tea flavor either.

The site would not let me copy the page so I will not be able to quote so you will need to look it up yourself.  Dr. Mercola claims erythritol is WORSE than High Fructose Corn Syrup.  It also often contain ARSENIC and other POISONS.  It is 99% FRUCTOSE and it effects are diarrhea, headache, stomachache.......................  The body cannot process it and that means if it is not completely eliminated it will stay in the body - what the body cannot process or eliminate will disrupt body processes in one way or another.

These are delicious premium cookies and pretty goshdarned expensive - an indulgence that I happily treat myself to once in a while - and I've never regretted the cost until this last order. The company changed their packaging from a nice little (cookie preserving) box to a resealable bag, the net result of which is that I paid a premium price for a bag of broken cookies and crumbs. The product pictured shows the old box - the product actually received is the new bag, and is filled not with cookie joy, but with crumbled disappointment. Won't be ordering these again.;negative

I read reviews preferring Da Vinci, so I gave it a try.  I prefer Torani.  Torani has fuller, truer flavor.  Da Vinci was very thin and had minimally higher sodium.  Can't really justify the price for Da Vinci.  Torani was strong enough to provide flavor and go a long way before needing to be restocked.  I am sorry I bought three bottles of Da Vinci.  But I am certain now, after my taste testing, that no matter what the flavor, Torani has a satisfactory rating with me, and Da Vinci has an unsatisfactory rating.;negative

When I spilled out mine into a bowl I noticed that it was mostly made up of Twizzlers and Jolly Rancher pops, both candy that are cheaper than the others..I'll get by with this for its Halloween after all, and beggars to the door can't be choosy.  But its disappointing that you don't get what you expect and am paying for.  That is, an equal mix of everything listed.  Recommended for the price, but not for the variety...;negative
I wanted to make yellow curry at home -- I love yellow curry! -- so I bought this.  Well, it was nothing but hot, no taste, just heat.  Yuck.  I tried a few different things to adjust how I was using it but none of them worked/resulted in something remotely tasty.  So, I tossed about 90% of this curry paste in the trash.  Pfft.;negative
DO NOT BUY!!! COFFEE HAS GONE BAD!!! This used to be my regular coffee but the new bag that I purchased and received in September 2014 is BAD. The coffee tastes SOUR. It is totally undrinkable and not eligible for return so I am stuck with $50 worth of bad sour coffee that I will have to throw away!!! Safe to say I will never buy their coffee again!;negative
I ordered the cocoa butter chips to make chocolate. Intead I received a jar with a huge block of cocoa butter. I guess the product is the same thing but I'm not really sure. Even if it is, it's far less convenient and not what I ordered. I contacted the seller who quickly responded with an appology and said the correct product would be shipped immediately. That was during the holidays.  It's the last week of february and still nothing. I do not recommend doing business with this seller.;negative
Lousy tasting junk!;negative
"This company is tops when it comes to raw macadamia nuts. I buy them on a regular basis, but thought I'd try 2 pounds of these hazelnits. Big mistake! I  have had hazelnuts that were in chocolate and liked them, so I had no hesitation when buying these. I wonder about roasting them to salvage them, and could use a suggestion as to how to avoid throwing them out. They certainly are not edible as they are now. (Update) One week later: I spoke with the company and was told ""They are supposed to taste like this""!";negative
Take this in my organic tea, no sugar, honey or anything along with foreskolin, Garcinia Cambodia and detox cleanse by Schwartz. I have not lost a pound. I can't tell a difference in the way I feel. I guess these products just was not for me.;negative

"This so-called natural sushi ginger includes the preservative, potassium sorbate, which is a synthetic preservative.  That's not exactly ""natural"" in my opinion and had I know that this product contained that preservative, I would not have purchased it.

You will notice that the photo of the package does not include the term, ""natural,"" on the package itself.  That term is only in the title and write-up here on Amazon.  I don't know who is responsible for these write-ups but I would suspect it is the specific vendor/provider of the product and not an Amazon's employee, but I don't know.

You will also notice that the ingredients are not listed in the ""information about product"" area, unlike the other Roland sushi ginger product, which does list potassium sorbate as an ingredient. For those of us who seek out foods without preservatives, the product information provided here plus the use of ""natural"" is misleading, at best.

Clearly, this product should not be touted as ""natural.""  To be clear, fundamentally, potassium sorbate is non-toxic and is regarded as safe. However, its synthetic characteristic is not looked upon favorably by many nutritionists and health-conscientious consumers.  Prolonged use of the preservative could lead to allergic reactions, nausea, diarrhea and nutrient loss in food. Toxicity of potassium sorbate is equivalent to that of table salt.

Given the large amount of sushi ginger that you will receive if you order this--a total of 96  ounces, you will indeed consume it, and its preservative, for a prolonged period of time.

Unless you toss it out, like I will be.";negative
This tea works for me. I have been drinking it for about a week. Like another reviewer 30 min after I drink it my hair starts itching so much. But, I received it after the date I was promised.  I give 3 star is because of this seller, but the product itself deserves a 5 star. I will buy it again from a different seller next time.;negative
Very bitter aftertaste. I recently had some monkfruit at a restaurant as a sweetner and liked it. I bought this one because it wasn't mixed with other substances, which I thought would detract from the taste. Sadly, I was mistaken. I guess one needs something to detract from pure monk fruit taste because it is very bitter and unusable. Back to the xylitol, I guess....;negative
"I really wish that the ingredients had been posted.  Here they are for the rest of you: Water, Organic Alcohol, Organic Agave Syrup, Organic Coconut Milk.  This very, very faintly smells of coconut, and kind of, almost, tastes like it.  Not sure why an extract, particularly one as sweet as coconut, needs a sugar in it?  As heat typically decreases the intensity of flavor(s), I can't imagine this ""Extract"" imparting much coconut flavor into baked goods.  I will try it in ice cream and frosting and update this review at that time.  I am thinking that, in order to get a super-duper coconutty flavor, I am going to have to just take the time and reduce some pure coconut milk.  Or, maybe I'll try juicing a fresh coconut.  Has anyone else tried this before?  Results?  I am open to suggestions.";negative
"Meh, its not bad. I didn't like the ingredients in the back. It states ""artifical flavor"" which is essentially not healthy since its ""artificial"" , will be looking for organic brand once I use up all of these.

We thought this was the greatest coffee ever - at first. As we tried others, we found it wasn't as great as we thought, or maybe our taste just changed. Hectic schedules need less caffeine, not more - hence we switched to Green Mountain Half-Caff.;negative
Truly disgusting, sat like a rock in my stomach, weren't sweet at all, didn't taste like cookies and cream at all.  If I could give it 0 stars I would.  Ended up giving them to a food bank, and I feel bad even doing that.;negative

"We had a BOGO free offer to try this flavor. Wish we had asked to buy a single because we hated it despite loving coconut water and liking other Dark Dog flavors.

The energy boost is actually amazing and withoit jitters or crashes so hubby mixed this into other drinks or just choked it down.

It has, to me a strange metalic taste and some odd other taste probably one of the great energy ingredients but without a stronger flavor to mask it I can't stand it.";negative
"Sugar-free pumpkin spice.  Bleh.  This has no flavor at all!  Ok, not entirely true.  It does taste like chemicals.  I realize that most ""pumpkin spice"" flavorings aren't about the pumpkin, but are about the nutmeg/ginger/cinnamon/allspice that go into pumpkin pie.  This has NONE of that, as far as I could tell.

The sugar substitute likely contributes to the off flavor, and I was ready for that.  But no spicy taste at all?  What's the point?  In my opinion, none.  Perhaps another flavor would be better, but I'm afraid it's one strike and this company is OUT.";negative
Too small and virtually flavorless;negative
K-Cups are defective. Filter collapses and you get a cup full of grounds or a partial cup of coffee. Whwen you try to remove the K-Cup it makes a huge mess dripping grounds and coffee all over everything. Called Tomothy's customer service three times and you get an anwering machine and they DO NOT RESPOND to your complaints. My Kuerig works perfectly with four other brands so it is definitely a defective product.;negative
Bought these because I LOVE Little Secrets. The gingerbread flavor is VERY strong. I ended up giving the unopened bags away. Won't be buying this flavor again. My favorites are the dark chocolate and peanut butter. Will just stick with those.;negative
Some packaging contains only 18 sticks (instead of the standard 20) and the size of the stick is about 2/3 size of the original.  You can still find the original but you have to read the fine print!!!  This new one is 1.7 g and the classic is 2 g.  The size of these new ones could easily get lost in a tooth cavity!!!!;negative
Really not very good.  Sorta 'brownie-ish' in flavor but its very dry and really stretching the definition of 'toffee'.  Maybe the way its made but nothing whatever in its flavor.  Pass on this if you're looking for toffee and also probably if you're looking for a good brownie experience, too.  Cheap enough to try, not to recommend to anyone.  Was going to have it out for the Christmas party but now will have to wait until everyone has had the good stuff.  Otherwise, I'm thinking compost bucket as it's just not good enough to waste the calories on . . . .;negative
love them as a kid.;negative
There are lots of unpopped kernels. I would estimate 25-30% of the kernels do not pop. I have left it in the microwave long enough to slightly burn the popcorn and there are still large amounts of unpopped kernels. The popcorn itself tastes average.;negative
"Unfortunately, this product doesn't look much like that which is on the package.  Maybe they've changed recently or got some cheaper alternatives in, but if you know matcha at all, you know this isn't what you're going to want.  The only good matcha is that which is made in Japan, and this is nothing more than a Chinese knockoff.

There are 3 main grades of matcha, though there are multiple sub-grades for those who are very serious.  The top grade is ceremonial tea which is pretty expensive.  Then there is the regular grade which most people drink, and then there is the culinary or cooking grade, which is about the lowest.  I'd call this at the bottom of the regular or top of the culinary grade.  I've seen worse, but this stuff really isn't worth drinking if you've had good regular grade matcha.  I bought the product and have since switched it over to a culinary container and will likely start making capsules from it so that I can use it without having to taste it.

Note the color of the product on the package.  That's what it's supposed to look like, a very bright and vibrant green, whereas the color of the actual product is more of a greenish brownish color and quite dull in appearance.  Some have described it as tasting like dirt, though I wouldn't go that far.  Nevertheless, if you want really good matcha, look elsewhere and look at the negative reviews.  Some negative reviews won't tell you much, but you can tell them from the ones who are specific about the matcha and reference it's grade and appearance.";negative
Pretty sour. If they were fresh raspberries I'd probably return them to the store, but I like the texture & they give a satisfying crunch. They leave a bit of a bitter aftertaste though, so not sure if I'll buy them again, especially at the current pretty high price.;negative
"The kiwi I received are not green at all. They are a pale yellow. They have sulfites and blue food color added- which would normally keep the expected green color you'd think, right?

The texture is powdery and rubbery at the same time. The taste is chalky, sweet, and faintly fruit like. I wish I could return these. They taste gross and I don't see how I'm going to use them. I usually enjoy dried kiwi straight as a candy like treat.";negative
The good news is that it totally works to relieve congestion quickly, BUT the bad news is that upon researching the ingredients I found that the first two are potentially seriously dangerous, especially when taking other prescription medications.

Don't count on getting what is pictured!!!  12 of the 30 I received were medium or light roast!!!  VERY DISAPPOINTED. I like dark, bold coffee and this was a stop gap measure to get me through moving in two weeks... without buying over 100 pods as is my typical order from Keurig. I supplement thought Amazon on certain kinds of K Cups.  THIS APPEARS to be broken box cups that are repacked into this assorted box... which would have been PERFECT if it actually was Extra Bold coffees!!!!;negative
A hot chocolate packet was the first K-Cup on my new Keurig (it was 1 a.m. and I wasn't ready for coffee before bed). I had read they ran a little watery but I decided to try it on the 10 oz. setting, took a sip, and tossed it. The next morning I made one with 8 oz. and added some whipped cream. The taste was kind of grainy and it was still pretty watery. My husband made one to try at 6 oz. and said it tasted like sugar water. I might try combining 2-3 6 oz. servings to use the box up but we won't be buying more.;negative
This candy tastes nothing like the candy I got of the same brand at CVS, made my husband and me queasy. We both love Truffles, but this does not deserve the name, When it at room temp. it was like tary sludge in the middle and if it is warm it is like a liquid oily mess in the middle. Never again.;negative
I had gotten the regular before, found it pleasant. This time I got the regular flavor and the champagne.  They were so watery the top was just liquid. Even stirring, ketchup is far thicker. The regular taste was edible, but the champagne... I'd sooner eat cat food. The smell and taste were so disgusting I rinsed the watery mess out and recycled the container. Total waste of money. Cat food would have been more pleasant.;negative
"I was on the sugar free energy drink kick for the longest time... I knew sucralose (Splenda) was causing me problems as any artificial sugar will do over time. So I searched and searched and this is the only energy drink that uses Stevia instead of artificial sugar as a sweetener. The taste isn't that bad and I drink them at room temperature. People used to sugary drinks (which I can't stand at all) probable won't like the taste. But if you are use to diet drinks and can learn to like different taste this drink would be the healthy energy drink to switch too. I just wished they made Guru energy shots.

WHI IS MY RATING SO LOW??? THE PRICE...it was $32..now it jumped to $50...I won't be buying anymore....WHY AMAZON WHY???";negative
"I'm beyond disappointed in this cherry cheesecake. It was just delivered and it looks absolutely nothing like the picture. I mean nothing like the picture!! Looks like a very thin thin line of red cherry juice was swiped crossed the top... and there's NO CHERRIES! Isn't this a ""cherry"" cheesecake? Then on top of that the cheesecake isn't even level. It's almost like they threw the cheesecake in the freezer and everything smushed to one side. Who wants to order a $40 cheesecake that looks like this?

So I'm going to have to go to the grocery store and buy two cans of CHERRIES so I can put on top of this cherry-less ""cherry"" cheesecake. I will post photos once it completely thawed to show you how terrible this cheesecake looks. I will never ever buy from this company again.";negative

Why do they put coconut ? I can't stand coconut flavor in my morning coffee .It says Almond but there's a terrible coconut flavor .Not even close to real cream ,you need Half a carton to get it to even look remotely close making ur coffee freezing , let alone the taste is no where near real cream .As a non dairy ,no soy seeker for health reasons this doesn't even come close .My journey continues, but  seriously doubt I'll ever find any coffee creamer that compares to real cream .Might have to go back to real cream ,health issues or not .Depressing cup of joe without real cream and this stuff will never do the job .Lose the coconut Califia and go back to the drawing board for me .;negative
I tried hard to like this and hoped to like it for the antioxidant benefits. Unfortunately, no matter how I cooked it I found the grains to be too firm and not aromatic at all. I found it to be lacking in flavor as well and no one in my family enjoyed this rice. We typically eat jasmine, brown, and red cargo rice and could not get over the texture and firmness of this black rice.;negative
Came crystallized :-(;negative
I do not know if the previous review have ever had a real coconut cookie. Can't, for the life of me, understand the raves about the great coconut taste... these cookies have zero coconut flavor. If you read the ingredients, this cookie has 2% OR LESS of coconut. My cookies were not stale. They did not taste bad. But, they had neither the taste or the crunchy texture of a coconut cookie. They are not crunchy at all. They taste exactly like graham crackers. Again, not bad tasting but very disappointing just the same. These cookies have a soft texture. These were very cheaply priced and would do for kids snack or maybe with your break time coffee but it leaves coconut lovers high and dry.;negative
The tea was good but a bit expensive for tea. I wanted to try a turmeric tea because turmeric is so good for you. It has a mustard taste. Like French's yellow mustard. Would not purchase again at that price. If it was $5.....maybe.;negative
I've ordered many spices from this company and continue to reorder from them, however, this is one spice I will NOT be reordering.  It was tasteless and has a funny color, almost like a neon yellow .. very weird.  NOT happy with this spice!!;negative
I bought the lemon and raspberry cold brew teas at the same time. The raspberry was wonderful. I tasted like summer with no artificial overtones. This was extremely disappointing. It tasted very artificial. I have tried to give the bags away to friends, but I have not found anyone who likes it. I will try to use it and doctor it up.;negative
"Not a bad cereal or a bad option, but it's a misnomer/hyperbolic name for a cereal...there aren't many pumpkin seeds or raisins, and the crunch comes from the relatively bland bran. Canceled my S&S immediately; wish I'd tried one box before I sprang for 6.";negative
Great.....now I agree with those of you writing about damaged product. The bottles are not square but bloated and round. The labels are peeling off, have air bubbles, and are not even straight. Amazon needs to explain this product and the deception.;negative
"They taste great, the price is outrageous. I only buy them if I can get them for $2 or less per bar, otherwise I can just make one by mixing nut butter and honey. That's all it is.

But the reason for my one star review is because of a longggg piece of human HAIR embedded into the bar. Disgusting. I tore open the end of the wrapper and kept it wrapped, and started eating. I was halfway through the bar, and I noticed a long hair. It was literally embedded into the bar. I know for sure it was not from my contamination because 1) I don't have that kind of hair, 2) I didn't unwrap the bar completely and noticed the hair as I unwrapped it.

I read on their website that they hand made these in their ""lab"" in cali or wherever. So basically its a bunch of people just smashing ingredients together in their kitchen with a fancy packaging machine to make it look professional. I just bought 3 cases of these, I might take them all back, because what ELSE is mysteriously embedded into these bars???? Sickening.

Lastly, the whole refrigeration thing is a marketing scheme. There is absolutely no reason from a food sanitary aspect for these to be refrigerated. I read on an interview article from one of the founders that the ONLY reason they are refrigerated is to prevent the oils from separating from the bar and pooling on top. The other reason he stated was because it gives consumers the IDEA of freshness, and wholesome ingredients. Don't be fooled, when was the last time you saw peanut butter, cashew butter, almond butter or honey being sold in the refrigerated section? They are shelf stable. Basically these guys just didn't want to add a simple emulsifier to keep the oil and water together, and wanted a way to trick consumers into thinking its better than the other bars on the shelves room temp. BUYER BEWARE.";negative
"First of all, I bought these with prejudice.  I'd recently purchased Starbucks sauce and syrup and they included the pumps at no additional cost.  I got spoiled.

So I didn't think to order pumps when I bought Ghiradelli and Torani sauces through Amazon.

After reading reviews and looking at prices, I bought these.  Disappointed.

Got a workout pumping the Torani Pumpkin Pie sauce.  But eventually it came out.

Broke a sweat pumping the Ghiradelli Caramel sauce so I left it alone for a while.  Thought the problem could be because the stem is too long.  So, I cleared away the caramel and trimmed off 3/8"".  Pumped some more for about two minutes and got a weak cough from the spout.  I thought to myself, ""it won't be long now.""  Except now, the pump doesn't even rise.  Got annoyed and started writing this scathing 1-Star review.  Looked over and saw the pump came back up and gave it another go.  Voila, caramel sauce.

Changed the review to three stars for making me have to work -- Oh, and for the packaging or lack of; I'd expect them to be individually cellophane sealed instead of open in an envelope.

*edit 02/03/12
Knocked it down to 2-stars.  Like another reviewer wrote it's not good for thick sauces, it definitely isn't.  The stem and spout are just too narrow.  I have to apply great pressure, put my body in it, to pump the caramel sauce.  Too much work getting my morning coffee.  I will spend more for the right pump.";negative
"Edited March 2018:  The two boxes I usually get were not the same quality this month.  They were ""wet"" and texture was off.  They are not expired, but they're open, so I cannot return them.  They have this month to return to the previous quality or we will no longer purchase.

To preface, I've bought this same brand of kelp noodles at Whole Foods before, so I know what to expect with regards to flavor, consistency, etc.  But when these came in the mail they were very different than what I'm used to--were dried out, gamey, and ultimately, after trying a bite, I had to throw them out instead of using them in the recipe I had started.  I tried preparing them the way I usually do (soaked in warm water and detangled with my hands) which normally works well, but it didn't help to rehydrate them.  I subsequently purchased more kelp noodles at Whole Foods which were perfectly fine, so it must have been an issue with a particular batch or how they were stored.  I will continue buying kelp noodles, but unfortunately would not purchase online again.;negative
Not impressed. Insanely sweet. Provides very little energy, no more than a cup of regular coffee. A vacuum left by removing the liquid from the plastic bag stops the flow after about half of the content has been used, making it hard to release the rest of it.;negative

"I ordered this set of chocolates because it appeared to have flavors that were missing from another Kit Kat bundle that I ordered from another web site.  My shipment did not include all of the flavors that were listed in the item description, which was my entire reason for ordering this set in the first place.  In addition to the large back of bite-sized Kit Kat, there were also 3 plain Kit Kats in the bunch. I can get a plain Kit Kat at any local store, so it was disappointing that they included these instead of trying to put in more variety.

Of the flavors listed in the item description, I didn't get Rum Raisin, Wasabi, Citrus, Apple, Sweet Potato, Strawberry, Raspberry, or Mixed Juice.  They included some other flavors that weren't listed (Ice cream, Sakura and Roasted Soy Bean, Caramel Purin, Sake, one in a white wrapper that  I assume might be white chocolate, and one in a pink wrapper that looks like it might be cherry blossom).  I would have preferred to get the flavors that I was expecting to get, though.";negative

"I've had Terra chips many times over the past nearly two years.  I purchased the 12 large bags of Sweets and Apples with the 20% off coupon.  The sweet potato chips are okay, with a good cinnamon flavor.  But the apple chips are extremely chewy, rubbery, and are inedible.  I don't remember this in the bag I had from the grocery store.  They are also dated to expire next month!  How can anyone use 12 big bags of chips in one month.  I don't think I can give them away now that I see they are stale or made wrong.

I also purchased the original flavor in the small bags of 24.  They are fresh and taste the same as usual, and are dated until December.  This leads me to believe the Apple chips are stale.  Very disappointed.";negative

"I am a regular, case purchaser of Bob's products. In the past, it was Musili.  I noted that there was a granola product which I imagined I would prefer because of the crunch. Muesli is not intended to be crunchy but Bob's is an excellent product.  Having said that, I was very  disappointed by in the Granola for the following reasons: (a) The granola seemed like it was intended to have a crunch but it was chewy instead as if the crunch went stale.  I checked the expiration date on the case from Amazon and it was fine being more than 6 months out.  Of course, I couldn't check to see if the bag had a hole in it in view of the fact that it was obviously already opened by me.  It did, however, come in a case but I don't want to open another bag so soon and take the risk of it starting to go stale. (I tend to use it slowly because I mix my cereals. Despite Bob's being made from great ingredients, it has the highest sugar (12g) of any other cereal I use and the most carbohydrates. Why can't they reduce that amount of sugar?). So, in goes some Bob's along with a Kashi product and/or a Multigrain Cheerios. (Don't laugh; the Cheerios have the lowest sugar load of just about any cereal made (6g); and (b) This is the most unforgivable thing about Bobs that I have never seen on virtually any other product. Despite their long dissertation on the bag about their interest in consumers, THEY HAVE NO TELEPHONE NUMBER LISTED!  I am not a big caller to manufacturers but a quick call to a Customer Support person (or to Bob himself) would have given me the information I needed - was the cereal stale or was it made chewy for a particular reason.  I just cannot comprehend why such a supposed consumer oriented manufacturer would make instant contact an impossibility.  (No, there was no email address either which is not normally seen anyway but perhaps would be a reasonable substitute for a company without a phone number).

So, I remain eating potentially stale cereal and will reconsider my purchases of Bob's other products. (People laugh at me anyway when they see so many boxes of Bob's in my pantry).";negative
"I really wanted to love these, but I just can't get on board. The flavor disappears after chewing 3 or 4 times, but the kicker is that it gets super soft and sticky once you're past 30 minutes.

I hate to say it because I paid so much for them and I have a lot of respect for Wild Planet, but I'll be feeding the rest of these to the dog.;negative
These 4 steaks are very mediocre and thin with little flavor, especially for the price.  Steaks usually cost double in a restaurant vs buying them and cooking them yourself but they basically the cost is same or are less and in addition from a restaurant one also usually gets a salad and 1-2 sides so in light of that these actually cost more.  Next time I will purchase steaks somewhere else.;negative
Can dented when it arrived;negative
"Man I had to write two bad reviews this month & I feel bad. I saw great reviews & was recommended this Jerky. My 5 year old niece & I love jerky so I tried to get a soft, easy to chew, non-spicy bag for us to share. Bought three bags of the ""original"" flavor and it's the toughest cuts of meat with silver skin that we strangled on. My teeth are sensitive and I could barely chew this. My teeth still hurt hours after eating it. I know I sound like a wuss but I have chronic illness. I prefer the thicker cuts of meat cut against the grain where as this is cut with the grain of the meat so it's chewy to say the least. Sorry for the bad review but I always want to be honest to help others. The flavor isn't bad but has a slight kick for kids, my niece said it was ""too spicy"". I used to make homemade jerky and it's a similar flavor but may need some pineapple juice to tenderize the meat some. It's not bad as far as flavor as I said but if you have tooth issues you might want to keep looking, this is nearly as tough as leather on some pieces.";negative
I love Wild Planet sardines - they're great!  I like to order the ones that are plain in extra virgin olive oil, which I thought this was (according to the description).  When they arrived they had an additional ingredient - aqueous natural smoke - AKA liquid smoke.  I contacted Amazon & they sent out a replacement apologizing for sending the wrong kind.  The same kind arrived again - smoked, not the plain kind.  I realize the photo for this listing says lightly smoked, but when speaking with Amazon, they said that the photos are not always accurate & I should rely on listing information. Just so you know, this particular listing information is incorrect.;negative
Was expired over 12 months;negative
Has weird aftertaste.;negative
Flavor is fair - nothing special.  The big issue is that it almost always comes out bitter.  I've tried adjusting the water temp, the steep time, and only use filtered water.  However, it's really tough to get a smooth, non-bitter cup.  It's a great price, but I'm afraid I won't be buying it again.  If someone else has had better luck avoiding the bitterness, let me know!;negative
This was our favorite coffee last year. We stopped drinking it for about 4 months because we were trying tea.  Well, we ordered a new batch last week of 50 cups and they apparently changed something with the product. The coffee is disgusting. Bitter, and undrinkable. Very disappointed!;negative
I like mushrooms but I'm sorry this product was inedible to me. Way too strong, I tried to get flavor out of my mouth with tuna jerky but the mushroom lingers. I would like a vegetarian option but this isn't it I'm sorry  Also non refundable but I didn't see disclaimer when I purchased. This is the first product I couldn't return with Amazon.;negative
Way too much sugar!!!!!!;negative
We tried this after purchasing the Angelino brand. this was very disappointing. The flavors were very weak and the regular roasts all tasted wateedr down. I had to brew them on 6 oz to get flavor. I would not buy this one again and I plan on going back to the Angelino brand;negative
Same great taste but for some reason the top cover that gets poked a hole in with the Kuerig maker is a little loose and allows for a bigger hole to be made, thus I have to deal with coffee grinds in my coffee.  I have to put a piece of tape on the topof the kcup cover to prevent it from tearing too large of a hole.  This is NOT a problem with my Kuerig Machine.  All my other K cups have tiny holes in them when I brew.  But these have a bigger hole because the top is not tight enough.  WILL I GT A REFUND???????????;negative
"This  breakfast tea has a weird aftertaste, not sure what to make of it, but I am used to drinking a different brand of organic black tea with a robust but smooth flavor ( I know that sounds contradictory right?); anyways I think I just bought a 16oz bag of stuff that I really will not be drinking or ordering any more of. I don't know it might just be up to personal taste bud preference, so I think another reviewer found it great. I may suggest you buy a smaller quantity, try it out to see if you like it before ordering a huge bag like me and then you're stuck with all that tea you don't like.";negative
What happened? Maybe I got a bad batch...  I have been buying this same jerky for quite a while. It has always been quite good with a strong but pleasant hickory+soy sauce flavor.  This time it tastes like not enough soy sauce was added and the hickory flavor is weak.  It also tastes slightly like rubber bands...;negative
This stuff was awful. Could not do anything with it. It was for my daughters birthday and I had to run down to my local Walmart and buy the wilton brand. Amazon refunded my money, which was the only thing OK with this situation.;negative
I was very disappointed in the condition of the lettuce upon delivery. It was half wilted (like, brown edges and everything), and it had also been squished under heavier groceries. I couldn't use it at all. Will not order again.;negative
It is purple.  It is very sweet.  I am sure that there must have been a lavender growing within 1000 miles of the bottling plant.  It is pretty poor for flavoring drinks.  Mostly you get sugar and pale purple color.;negative
The expiration date was 10/15 but they were spotted almost to the point of looking white, stale tasting and even had a bad after taste.  Like another reviewer said I was expecting them to be like the yummy Joya ones..  Sad to say but I threw the box away as felt it was stupid to eat the calories when they tasted so bad.  This from a chocoholic!;negative
I've purchased these in the past without any complaints. Sincerely Nuts arrived this time infested with almost  microscopic size ants. Yes I mean ANTS an ENTIRE COLONY OF ANTS!  After opening the bag my home was overcome with light brown ANTS!  Aside from living up to thir unwashed name, this time the seeds are damp, being nasty can't begin to fit the bill.  Ive never had an insect problem, now I have poison everywhere and my investment in my recent purchase has been overwhelmingly disgusting. I would have gladly returned the just opened bag button chose to rid my home from these though little insects instead.  So beware of unwashed seeds, as they could arrive with company ..making them completely useless, beyond disgusting in addition to a waste of money.  I noticed that Ziploc top on this latest bag was differently that of my first bag, fewer rows of zipper freshness to keep the freshness in,and the ants as well.  Be aware you might get a bag that's from the same batch my insect ridden bad arrived with.;negative
Started dying the minute I opened it. It has a few leaves clinging to it that I'm trying to salvage through sheere force of mind over matter. I would not buy this item again from this seller, much to my dismay. I had high hopes upon receipt, but it's failing fast.;negative
I purchased the Chocmod Truffettes de France Natural Truffles 2.2 lbs several times over the past few years during the holidays. They are mostly for gifts. Our family enjoys truffles and chocolate but these just don't taste very good when I tried them. They really lack a rich chocolate flavor and taste mostly like oil or fatty filler. My kids and wife love chocolate and candy won't eat them. I threw the box out midway through as it just lingered in the house. Would not buy again even though the low cost/pound is enticing.;negative
Decent cooking oil, but NOT as a dietary supplement. When used in large amounts as a dietary supplement (example: a tablespoon in a cup of decaf coffee for a boost of energy) it makes hubby and me feel ill afterwards with a queasy stomach. This does not happen with our other high quality, organic coconut oil brands we have tried. Now I only use it for cooking in small amounts and for my homemade topical health products.;negative
We have yet to find (trust me tried ALOT of them) a mix that Bob Red Mill's sells that taste good.  It's down right awful and gritty.  If you think this is good your surely missing out on alot of other great products.  It seems some new age products coming out are alot better tasting and the consistancy is much better.  Search around try Jules but this stuff is gross and regreted buying a case of it.;negative
"Ordered the Pineapple/Coconut and the Blue&Blackberry flavors.  The pineapple-coconut is an acquired taste.. one that we will probably Never acquire!  Yuck.  The Blue & Blackberry is pretty decent, but this stuff is waaaay too expensive.  It takes more than a ""few squirts"" to get a drinkable flavor.  If the price were about half of what it is now, we would probably purchase more.";negative
after adding this to my morning smoothie it had a negative effect on my disposition.  normally a very happy person, i became irritable and grumpy and got angry over the least little thing.  i researched it on line and found others who had similar experiences.  with all the other wonderful powders available, such as acai and maqui,  i would avaoid the maca root.  it threw it out.;negative
Too tough to cut or to chew even after being soaked for 5 hrs and then cooked in a stew. Tasteless. Stomach issues as well by one customer. Would have returned but cook threw out the package.  We have not had this problem with the ones already cut up and sold in plastic bottle.;negative
"Instead of just being pork rinds, oil, salt and vinegar, they have lactose and maltodextrin on them, contributing to 2g of sugar per serving.  Many people (myself included) who buy this kind of snack who are on low carbohydrate diets; they will not be happy about the sugar.

The labeling on the package is very strange, and I am surprised it gets by the nice government men who worry about this sort of thing.  It says Total Carbohydrates are less then 1g, so they get to put zero grams.  Ok, fair enough, I have seen that before.  But then the label admits to 2 grams of sugar, which is a carbohydrate.  How they can get away with saying they have zero grams of carbs when there are 2 grams of sugar is beyond me.  I assume it is just that nobody has caught them yet.

Then there is protein.  The nutritional analysis says 8g of protein per serving.  Not bad for a snack food.  Right next to the 8g is says ""Not a significant source of protein.""  Huh...A slice of cheese is about 8 grams of protein, as is an ounce of meet.  I believe those are significant sources of protein.

I went to their website, to check out the nutritional facts.  I did notice they were high in sodium.  What I missed was that they claim the number of servings in a 1.75 oz package was three (3), so the sodium in a package is actually three times higher.  I doubt many people expect a 1.75 oz package to be three servings.  I just looked up Fritos Corn chips.  A 2 oz package is considered a single serving package, and the analysis on the back shows one serving.  So when Fritos tells you the sodium level, it is only 320 mg for the entire package.  For these pork rinds, the 1.75 oz package is 900 mg of sodium, about half of your daily requirement.  A little steep for a snack.

Although I went to their site to look at some nutritional info, they don't shows the label or the actual ingredients on their site or at Amazon.  If they had, I would not have purchased it.  They use partially hydrogenated oil, a kind of fat may be destructive to your health long term.  Since the government broke down and required that partially hydrogenated oil be listed on the label, a lot of the food industry has switched away from it, as people are correctly suspicious of it.

To add insult to injury, I was unhappy with the taste.  They have a chemical, nasty taste.  I suppose that is subjective, but a few bites left me a little queasy.

I feel bad having bought this, but perhaps my error will be of some use to others looking for a low carb snack.  Please pass this company's products by, and let's find someone else who can actually provide us the food we want and the information we need in a rational, ethical and legal way.";negative
"There was a time when this was a good product.  A ""go-to"" item for the cocktail crowd.  With time it has degenerated.  Now -- most cherries have lost their stems, and the fruit is pretty banged up, so torn open.  A big difference from this same product a couple years ago.";negative
should be called raspberry dust;negative
I found half filled packs and packs that were actually empty, lots of them.  For this price I expected more.  I tried to contact the company twice and received NO ANSWER.  Big red flag.  I finally gave up and will not be ordering this again.  I did order the same product in bulk form in a bag from another site (netrition) and found the granules to be smaller and easier to dissolve.  The granules are too big and they don't put enough in each packet making it not sweet enough unless you add like 3 or 4.  Ridiculous....use another brand!! .;negative
Based on the good reviews, I bought four cartons.  Big mistake.  I at firs thought our coffeemaker had failed because we were getting grounds in our cups and the maker was full of grounds and most of the water went into the tray .  Surprise!  I cleaned the unit per instructions and it worked fine for one cup and then acted up again.  I again cleaned it out and tried Newmans Own coffee.  It worked perfectly.  After many cups I went back to the Dark Magic.  Like magic - plugged again.  It even popped the top seal on the coffee cartridge allowing grounds to go everywhere.  I think the difference is that Newmans Own has a built in filter and the Green Mountain does not.  I just don't understand the high customer ratings because I am sure my maker is not unique in any way...and it works with other brands.  So, Now I have three full cartons of useless coffee.  Once I figure out how I will have to talk to Amazon and see what can be done.  PS:  the coffee tastes fine (until you hit the grounds in the bottom of the cup).;negative
I was very disappointed with the lack of taste of this maple syrup.  I wanted to use it to make maple cookies as a surprise for my son who loves anything maple.  I did not tell him what kind of cookies they were, and asked him to tell me what they tasted like to him.  He couldn't.  I explained that they were supposed to be maple cookies, but he could not taste it all.  He did acknowledge that they had a very slight maple aftertaste after I advised him of the kind of cookies they were supposed to be.  I am very unhappy since this was to be a surprise gift sent to him since he lives in another state. I would never buy this again, especially not for cookies.;negative
"Okay coffee but better beans in 5LB bags can be had for roughly same price, maybe just a few dollars more. I habe no idea how this item became a bestseller... shows how many dumb/unknowledgeable bees can ""hive mind"" together and placebo each other into thinking this is a bestseller ""hive"" lol. Look for other coffee that's also packaged better... these beans came unclear ziploc unlike foil-lined paper bags of other offerings.";negative
"I should have heeded the negative reviews for this natural maple extract since it imparts almost no flavor.  Yes, it smells wonderful and rich in the bottle, but once you add it to a recipe, it adds nothing.  I wanted natural maple extract to make maple walnut ice cream.  Real maple syrup leaves ice cream too icy if that's the only kind of sugar I use, and so I wanted to half the syrup but boost the flavor with this.  I hate to say it but McCormick's Imitation Maple Extract has more flavor than this -- that's not a good thing.

I'm going to have to keep searching for a real maple extract that actually isn't a waste of my money.

"This is not 6 bags like the title and description CLEARLY stated!  Since then, they have changed it, but many bought prior to the change.

"We wanted a a pasta that was not made from flour. I saw reviews from other sources and was interested.  When  it arrived,  I was surprised at the weight of the packages. This was due to the liquid (water?) it is packaged in. However, the bags burst open and the liquid covered other items in the order, even tho they were in their own box in the order.
Next I noticed the smell. Off putting fishy smell.  Even when the unopened package was rinsed when used later, we could not get over the smell. The taste was not not much better.
It does offer an alternative from regular wheat pasta, just not for a right fit for us.";negative
"With all of the rave reviews I wanted to try this.

I am unsure if I got a bad batch or what.. but.. it just was not good in so many ways.

I am unsure why the following would happen, but in the popped version of the popcorn there were an enormous amount of hard hulls. This does not, or at least has never previously, happened to me. It made the popcorn not really edible as they found their way between my teeth all over.

I guess I was ok with eating something with ingredients I normally wouldn't, once in a while, if the end product was really good, but for me it was not.

Some of the things I wouldn't normally consume include the artificial colors and additives that I did not look into enough to realize they were there, before my purchase... I guess yellow coloring sells popcorn in the theater as it gives the impression of being buttered, I would prefer something more natural and do much better with picking out my own popcorn, popping it my way and adding a bit of my favorite pink salt.";negative

"Update. The owner did email me some useful tips on how to get the full benefits of this tea. Unfortunately, it's still not helping to lower my blood sugar. Please don't let my review persuade you not to buy this product. Try it and see if it works for you.

I'm happy that most reviewers got good results from this tea because it didn't happen with me- I find this product to be very weak in flavor and that's with the first brew; not the second or third time of reusing.

I emailed the company to see if there's something I could do differently in getting better results but haven't gotten an answer yet.
My blood glucose still stays the same even if I'm drinking this three times per day. Truthfully, I get better results using sage tea. Oh well, it was worth trying I guess. Just wish I wouldn't have purchased two packages.";negative
very weak/faint garlic flavor;negative
I bough this tea to see if it would be a good replacement for the Traditional Medicinals Smooth move... YEAH NO! this is painful! I love the triple Leaf brand, & this tea works but this just will not be a tea I purchase again. TM's tea does not cause the painful stomach cramps this one does. I wanted one without the stevia and I will just have to test out another version of TM's smooth move at this point.;negative
"I like my coffee stronger than these, even made on the smallest cup it was too weak compared to Barista Primo ""Italian.""  I usually buy the Barista Primo brand, but thought I'd give this one a try and save a little money (72 k-cups for under $35.00).  It wasn't worth sacrificing the flavor of a stronger cup of coffee. I will not buy again.";negative
Received meted;negative
I got these for my husband as he mentioned loving them when he was younger. They tasted so much like chemicals I was unable to finish even one cookie. He says they are not as good as he remembers. I got the three pack. He's taking to work to share. They are not very tasty.;negative
I bought this with serveral other teas because soda has gotten too expensive.  We make tea by the gallon and then put them in the frig.  This saves a lot of money as there are 9 people in our household.  This tea does have a very nice flavor but you have to hunt for it. All-in-all I will not buy it again because it is just too weak.;negative
"I bought this with expectation that it would be sweat... but no. The outer layer of the Apricots has a dry coating? It feels like there's light coating of flour. It leaves your mouth a bit dry and has a stale taste. These have a very faint sweat taste. It has been months since I purchased it and yet it still remains almost untouched... They may be good for salad after dicing, but don't expect vibrant Apricot sweatness from it.
I should have just stuck with Mango slices...";negative
"I bought these with some raw chips and snacks which were wonderful, but some for reason the seeds had black spots and smell and taste moldy, I thought maybe they were just that way. Did some reach and found out. You have to make sure the temperatures are stable when stored so not to draw moisture. I received these that way. I don't know if it happened in shipping or what. It maybe to your advantage to get next day delivery if available.
Sorry for the review. I hope this was an isolated issue.";negative

A friend brought me back from Sao Paulo's duty free shop this amazing limited edition of Toblerone. I loved it so much and I looked for it everywhere. However it is a limited edition which is too bad and quite expensive. I was happy to make my purchase and when I finally got my hands on it was devastated to find that the chcolate was stale with the characteristic white patches of chocolate that has been stored in refrigerators or gone bad.;negative
Meh, I'm not really that big of a k cup fan but these are pretty bad. some are stale.. others taste horrible. It was fun at first but mad were they a waste of money. Sent some to mu husband on deployment, at least he seemed to enjoy them.;negative
Oh my, I had to throw all three away - crumbled apart as if months old. Toast was not possible! The biggest piece was about 1.5inch long on one side. Really nasty flavor - I have eaten this type of bread for years with great pleasure, but these had a faded, dusty, off taste. Nothing I have ever experienced or expected with this brand. I suspect either a knock-off, or so old that should not have been sold as new!! Very disappointing.;negative
This popcorn is nicely packaged and healthier than most, but the taste is so bland and boring.  I prefer Black Jewel brand.  I had to eat it with melted butter which is yummy but defeats the purpose of a low-fat, healthy snack.;negative
The taste is not that great;negative
The cucumber flavor was terrible and I threw away the bottle after one sip. The other flavors are not very good. It seems more like you are drinking some kind of liquid medicine that's been flavored to hid a medicine taste. Furthermore, each bottle is supposed to provide about 20 servings, but the reality is each bottle is good for about 3 servings. These are a waste of money.  I'm hesitant to ever buy any water enhancers after this experience.;negative
My own fault, I thought I was ordering some variety of veggie jerkee. This tastes like salty coconut flavored bacon bits, and for my taste, it would ruin any actual food I put it on. Maybe an extremely small amount on a baked potato wouldn't be horrifying, but it wouldn't be an improvement either. I'll try to give it away but I can't imagine any of my veg-head friends would want it either. I hate wasting money, I'm not rich! It's way too salty to even compost.;negative
"We ordered these first on December 23, 2013. They were the individually wrapped Washburn Dad's that had that logo on their wrappers.
Reordered on January 17, 2014 and did not receive the same candy. These were in a different bag, with a printed label that stated Washburn Dad's, inside the candies were wrapped with clear cellophane wrappers with no logo. When husband tried one he said they were not as good as the first order. Must be a different brand and not what was ordered. We probably will order again, but it will be the last if not the correct brand candy.
Disappointed!

Edited to add: When we filled in the Seller Feedback we were with the impression that these were the Original candies not the generic, otherwise it would have received less stars and a feedback saying so. Must remember to try them first next time.
We did however just receive a package of Dad's barrels from another seller today and those are the correct ones.
Husband will be happy to have great tasting candy again.";negative
"I did not think coconut and dark chocolate could ever taste bad.
I was expecting mainly those 2 ingredients. I was wrong. It's mostly a date flavor and texture with a sprinkle of coconut and a thin chocolate coating. I did not taste cashews or almonds at all. Maybe the folks that are rating these bars highly have acquired a taste for such items.";negative

"According to ""The Ramentator"" this is he hottest ramen on the planet. It's actually not that hot but has a slow building afterburn from the habanero peppers. It's the wrong kind of heat for ramen -- really belongs in a chili.";negative
I've tried all the flavors at least once.  Original and Teriyaki multiple times.  First batch of Original and Teriyaki was great, 2nd and 3rd batches too over-flavored.  Pepper was too peppery (and I love pepper).  Hickory was too strong/salty.  Just not consistent.  Not going to waste more money on this product.;negative
"I will never buy the Teriyaki flavor again. It definitely is not the traditional teriyaki flavor like most store-bought jerky is. This one was just sweet, and way too sweet at that. It also molded after 3-4 days. I sent it back, got another one in. Before I even opened it, I saw mold on it.

I have bought their Sweet-Hot flavor before, it is awesome! A little sweet with a kick. And I don't know why, if it was just the teriyaki but the Sweet-Hot did not come molded, or mold after only a few days. I slowly munched on it for a couple of weeks and it was still fresh and mold-free on day 14 as it was day 1.

I recommend Sweet-Heat. DO NOT BUY TERIYAKI THOUGH!";negative
I bought this because it was described as recyclable. However the recycling process is no different that that for any  other k-cup. Empty the coffee, clean out the plastic part and recycle. And did I mention the coffee is subpar?;negative

Taste horrible.;negative
Number one complaint... Packaging it was very thin and was ripped open and oregano was all over the inside of the box that it was shipped in. Flavor weak I was expecting more, kind of disappointed. I would not buy it again. There was way more stick and stem then leaf.;negative
I love gluten-free organic healthy food but this one is just plain icky. At first bite it is bland and hard to chew, then the flavor turns to something resembling a dog treat that ends with a strange inedible aftertaste. They taste nothing like peanut butter. I hate to be harsh but how can you mess up a peanut butter ball? Perhaps we got a bad batch? The almond butter balls are MUCH better.;negative
Only reason I'm giving this 1 star is because they sent me desecrated peppermint shavings. They were supposed to be leaves as advertised but it was literally a mound of completely destroyed peppermint mulch. Which is very difficult to use, it's so shredded that it comes through the fine mesh tea balls and gets into your water. Other than that, I love this brand, wish I would've taken care of the issue right away and gotten a replacement for the actual leaves as advertised. Will order them again once I've used up the mulch and hope I will get the right thing next time!;negative
i already wrote a review on this product in the english toffee flavor and it clearly states that i like the concept of the product but not the nasty bitter taste. if you use 1 or 2 drops its not sweet enough, 3 or more drops and its a bitter sweet taste. i still have 2 almost full bottles send a self addressed envelope and i will send you mines for free. will never purchased this product again and this is coming from someone who don't eat regular sugar at all so i wasn't expecting an overly sweet taste!;negative

"My wife's doctor recommended Glucerna shakes for her in-between meal snacks. She chose the Glucerna chocolate flavor and was very disappointed. Too heavy an artificial chocolate flavor. After tasting some I agree the company has to go back to the drawing board and come up with a better, normal, every day candy bar-like chocolate flavor like ""Glucoburst"" which is also available at Amazon. Com  It is not a thick shake but is great tasting. Also, Victus.com has their ""Enterex Diabetic"" a thick shake which beats most diabetic shakes for flavor and has no fructose or corn syrup,check it out. Don't settle for just any brand just because it says ""for a diabetic"". Try at least three or four different companies before settling on a brand without fructose added if possible. Check out ""fructose & diabetics"" on the web also log onto the ""nutrition reporter.com"", their article has some very, very negative information regarding fructose and corn syrup. Please read the article it's very informative.  Good luck in your quest for better tasting protein shakes.

I'm pretty sure this was the first 'sugar-free syrup' I've ever bought. So maybe they're all like this...but this stuff has a weird aftertaste. And the overall maple flavor just isn't very strong. I doubt I'll use it again and I think I'll just go back to the full sugar stuff.;negative
I have opened 6 cans now. Each is primarily water with tiny, shredded bits of chicken meat floating in fluid. Sorry, but if you own a cat that's probably where you'll donate this product. It is so watery you can shake the cans and they sound like there's nothing in them but fluid. This was an expensive disappointment.;negative
I made the mistake of forgetting to stock up on Aldi's Hot Dark Chocolate mix during the holidays. It is only stocked there seasonally. I tried this instead and it's terrible as it is very watered down and mostly all sugar. I will use it in microwaved milk.;negative

"Contains sulfites and dyes.  I'm evidently allergic to this product because my face swelled up as I chewed it.  My dad used to make excellent crispy green papaya preserves.  For the crispiness, he used to marinate the strips in baking soda; the Domino cane sugar added the flavor as it cooked.  I don't cook so I've tried many brands of dry or preserved papaya in order to find a similar product but none compare to what Dad used to make.";negative
I bought these for a bachelorette party and was disappointed when many arrived broken.  Contacted the seller hoping for replacements for the completely damaged pieces but seller would not replace them.  I ended up replacing the damaged ones myself at a local gas station.  Wish I had just purchased them local to begin with.  Any savings I got from purchasing in bulk and online was lost when I had to buy replacements for the unusable damaged candy.  Plus the ring pops I received were all unusual flavors, it is a variety pack but I expected at least a couple of the classic grape and cherry flavors but didn't get a single one in my assortment.;negative
I just didn't care for the taste;negative
This product tastes terrible. It is sweet enough for me because don't like sticky sweet tea. But it is SO weak! I would hardly call it a concentrate. I started with half tea/half milk, then less and less milk. Horrible. There is barely any spice to it as well. Do yourself a favor and keep looking elsewhere.;negative
Pretty bland compared to a lot of Thai Kitchen's products.  I was expecting to actually taste some curry flavor -- but even adding the flavor packets from 2 packages, its was just colored water.  I'll still probably use them -- they are gluten free rice noodles, so maybe as the base of some other dish -- but not as a ramen-like snack or light meal the way I do with their Spring Onion flavor.  I do feel a little like was cheated out of an awfully high price point for something that produces colored water and 2 cents worth of rice noodles....;negative

This stuff is not coconut flour just like the other reviewer said  it is just ground shredded coconut, it almost is just a very fine shredded coconut (but still not very fine) Not at all like coconut flour!

"The texture is smooth...but waxy smooth rather than the smoothness of a regular chocolate bar. I ate two pieces off one bar and it gave me gastric distress. So, watch out! Try just one square first. The price paid for this chocolate bar is WAY overpriced. That much I do know. I can compare it to a few other sugar free chocolates out there and I'd say Russel Stover's sugar free candy actually tastes more like chocolate...and you get a greater variety with Russel Stover's. I can eat 3 pieces of Russel Stover's and have no gastric issues. NOW, eat too much of any sugar free chocolate and you'll be sorry. This Chocoperfection does have an odd taste. The chicory root? I really didn't know if I was eating chocolate or what. I'm sitting here writing this review after having eaten these two squares of Chocoperfection an hour earlier...and my stomach is still doing dipsy doodles. I will say I tried it and won't be purchasing anymore. I might find someone that likes it...but I'll warn them to start off with just one square.

Lastly, this milk chocolate bar reminds me more of a dark chocolate...or semi-sweet. Only, it doesn't taste like dark or semi-sweet. Even the color looks dark and not exactly like milk chocolate. Stick to Russel Stover's. They will be much easier on the wallet, and you'll get something that tastes like milk chocolate.";negative
This came highly recommended from some foodie friends but honestly I do not think it has much aroma or flavor.  I am a Manhattan drinker and I thought a few drops of this would spice up the drink but it is not strongly flavored enough to make a difference.  I may try it in some cooking applications such as marinades or mincemeat pie, but I think I'd probably use 1/4 of the bottle.;negative
Quality wasn't great. Tasted stale.;negative
This item is not normal for Achva. It wasn't near its expiration date. Halva/Halwa is supposed to be soft and flaky. This item had a gooey texture, was greasy and had little flavor to it. The picture on the label does not resemble the product inside the package no matter what one's expectation level is. Being stale would have been a step for this item. No matter what price this is put at, don't waste your money.;negative
I took a chance on this and bought two and hadn't tasted it before.  It just didn't taste as good as other brands to me.  It was sort of yellowish and after using it a couple of times, it just didn't make the grade for me.  It could have been old, but it seemed over-sweet and not as flavorful as the other brands that I really like.;negative
"It comes out of the can in the shape of...THE CAN FROM WHENCE IT CAME!!! It looks like SH**. (And with artificial flavorings etc, it could be SH**). I figured I would swallow my conspiracy-theory consciousness and give it a taste just to be fair. EEK (and we're not talking about a purple cartoon cat here), I didn't like it!!! My 94 year old mum didn't like it!!! But then who am I to voice my opinion since it will probably get yanked! YOU TRY FOR YOURSELF!!! AND IF YOU DIE AS A RESULT....DO NOT BLAME ME!!
UPDATE!!!  UPDATE!!!  UPDATE!!!  UPDATE!!!  UPDATE!!!
I am someone who for many personal reasons does not like to waste food so, before donating it to charity, I TRIED IT AGAIN!!! The result was the same: I GAGGED!!! So, I'm NOT DONATING THIS TO CHARITY as I do not want a murder rap pinned on me!!! ROSARITA, MEET REPUBLIC SERVICES!!!";negative
I'm definitely not a sloppy Joe expert, but this didn't taste anything like any sloppy Joe I've ever had.  I'm rather disappointed with this, since we use so many Mrs. Dash products and all the others we've tried have been great.;negative

"In search of the perfect white mocha to add to my Americano coffees, I decided to try out this one. Sadly, it is not the one for me. Everyone has their own tastes and preferences. To me, this just tasted like sweetened condensed milk with some very artificial-tasting white chocolate-like flavoring added. My husband doesn't seem to mind it, but he's not as snobby when it comes to chocolate and coffee as I am. The search continues...
(Also, on a side note, keep in mind that this sauce does take 3 weeks to be delivered after order is placed.)";negative
I HAVE NOTICED THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM AS ANOTHER REVIEWER- I USED TO BUY THESE ALL THE TIME AND THEY WERE WONDERFUL- THOSE CANS CAME FROM THAILAND- NOW I AM GETTING SO MANY SHELLS AND JUNK IN EACH CAN- I HAD TO SPEND HUNDREDS OF HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS ON A VENEER FOR MY FRONT TOOTH AFTER CHIPPING IT- THESE JUNK CANS ARE FROM CHINA- A SHELL EVERY ONCE IN A BLUE MOON IS ONE THING- HAVING MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF SHELLS IN EVERY SINGLE CAN IS QUITE ANOTHER!!!;negative

I don't know what kind of vanilla this is, but I opened it today and it has NO vanilla smell whatsoever.  I've never in my life seen vanilla like this.  In disgust, i rummaged around my cabinet and found another brand that I had from THREE years ago, opened it, and it smelled delicious.  Three years later!  This Nielson Massey one is going in the trash.  I recommend looking for a Mexican vanilla.;negative
Got recall about it;negative
Not a Dark Roast.  Not close to French Roast.  I could not even call this a Bold medium roast.  However it is not bad coffee.  Just not a Dark Roast.  I  used 6 oz instead of 8 oz and could not get how anyone who drinks French Roast could call this strong.  Maybe it is a good support for cream and sugar.  Not for strong coffee lovers.  Had to give away.;negative
"I did not think that one can leave a negative feedback for canned beans, but I could not resist. I am so disappointed, and to be honest, I am not sure in who.... the bean farmer or the Libby's, who cans them. These beans are unbelievably bland. There is no taste, no structure. These beans taste half way dry on the inside. Granted, that I rinse all of my beans to wash off some salt and preservatives, but the actual bean taste should and does always remain in all beans I ever rinsed. I never had that issue before, but I ever purchased specifically Libby's beans on the outside to know if this is a common thing in the brand. It could be that these are super organic, and all I ever had recently was the face monsanto junk. Who knows.....

I bought kidney/ red beans from Libby's as well, and I have not tried those yet. I am afraid it will be a great disappointment as well. I may actually take them to a shelter.";negative
Not as advertised;negative
The chocolate flavor was sickly sweet, as if they went overboard on the stevia in this one. It did not taste very much like chocolate at all either. I really hope they improve on the flavor. It would have been nice to have a tasty non-dairy organic protein shake option. Guess we will stick to the Orgain chocolate shakes for now and try this one again in a few months.;negative
I'm sorry but these were my first time trying these but very disappointing.  Some strips were very sour and the rest were just plain bad like maybe a bruised or bad spot didn't get cut out.  I ended up throwing the bag away.  I won't be trying these again.  They are too expensive to be gambling on.;negative
"The idea of jarred organic minced ginger is a good one, though likely not as flavorful as freshly grated whole ginger, it would be convenient.  This mushy, puree-texture ginger from China has sugar and rice vinegar added, but comes with no protective safety seal under the lid.  The lid arrived loose and jar leaking, making the opened minced ginger unsafe to eat.  The company would do nothing about it without a ""photo of the damage.""  Thankfully, Amazon stepped in.  Alternatively, one may purchase nonorganic minced ginger from a different company who packages their minced ginger properly, or take a bit more time to grate your own fresh ginger.  Due to ongoing packaging problems, this Chinese ginger is Not recommended.";negative
not that great;negative
Maybe something with the fact that these are repackaged, but I had 2 in my order that failed.  Started to drip, then stopped and overflowed in the machine getting grounds everywhere.  Quite a mess each time it happened.  Never had that happen with any other brand of pod.;negative

I was looking for some meat sticks. Like actual real beef in stick form. I've had the tillamook beef sticks (delicious). I saw these AND WITHOUT reading any reviews (smh) I ordered these. They sounded and looked good. I think I was hungry at the time. Anyways, I got them and ripped open and took a huge bite and literally spit it out. Snap into a slim Jim? That's exactly what these are. Horrific horrible meats packaged in tube form. I ended up given them to my dogs for treats.  In conclusion: if you like slim jims, you'll love these knuckletastic tubes of heart meat and such.;negative
"The vanilla flavor has a sour or bitter aftertaste that totally eliminates any enjoyment.  The chocolate flavor is fine, and I don't notice this taste with other brands of sugar wafers.

Definitely NOT buying vanilla again.";negative
As is often the case with products geared toward those following a low carb way of eating, this product is a cruel reminder of what we can no longer eat rather than an acceptable alternative to the thing its supposed to be. The entire family experienced terrible gastric distress after eating just one of these (The maltitol from the chips is likely the culprit) and honestly....they tasted like I'd rather be fat. As another reviewer suggested, you're better off skipping the boxed stuff and locating a recipe online.;negative
"I love Hormel Compleats. They're all very convenient, since I can stash them in a cabinet in my office and not worry about remembering to bring something from home, or about it getting stolen from the communal refrigerator.

I didn't care much for this... the dressing is pasty, gluey and has way too much celery for my taste. The gravy is too salty. The chicken breast is dry, stringy, and difficult to cut unless you remove it to a plate, which defeats the purpose of such a quick microwave meal.";negative
"Stale nuts, so stale and too many bad ones. I bought these, the candy ones (awful!) and the regulars - all were very disappointing. Too many stale ones, bad ones and rotten ingredients used in the choc and candy ones.

I found a better provider, it is hard to find good hazelnuts these days and the provider I found has already sold out for this year.";negative
Ok, not what I thought.;negative
I couldn't tell you where it happened, but when I received the shortbread it was the first thing I opened. Unhappily the cookies were all in crumples and only one cookie was whole. The good thing is, the flavor of the shortbread cookies is really nice, so I will use this in the crumb topping for my apple pie.;negative
It tastes fine. However, the little bit of glue added to hold the tab to the bag of tea causes a hole to form when I pull the holding tab away. The tea comes out into the cup, and I have to dump the tea. This happens to about 20% of the bags.;negative
I am not a fan of the Indian Tonic Water. I usually order the regular Q tonic and love it, but they were out. So I substituted this....that was a mistake. It is soooooo sweet--it has sugar instead of agave. I have now reordered the regular Q tonic and will mix some of this in with that just to get rid of it.;negative
This product is using a slightly different formulation on the standard Hershey's chocolate or the age had given it an off taste.  There is a difference in the graphics on the individual bars when compared to the local product.  Expiration date was less than 3 months.  I will not order again, can buy better and cheaper at Walmart.;negative
These are made in China and claim to be USDA organic, since the USDA can't even get to all the new organic farms in the USA, I have my doubts, to put it mildly, about China. I never would have bought these if I'd known, but once in my hands I found it in the small print, ARGH. As it is an edible item they won't let me return it. BEWARE;negative
"I REEEEEEAALLY wanted to like this stuff. It sounded like it was going to be wonderful.... but I was truly disappointed.  I have had black cocoa (being from New England and it being a required ingredient for TRUE New England whoopie pies), I've had dutch cocoa and even Hershey's cocoa... I've even had cocoas from all over the world and I have never been so disappointed as I have with this product (yes, even Hershey's was better than this).

There was not even a hint of any ""cocoa"" smell when I first opened the bag, or any time there after.  It smelled... horrible - I can't quite put my finger on what it was that I was smelling... maybe chemicals... this is a horrible way to describe the smell, but it is the closest way to describe what I smelled before, during and after using it:

I had an art teacher in the 8th grade, who was a dear woman, who smoked cigarettes and drank coffee like it was on an IV drip nearby.  She LOVED to get in our ""personal space"" to let us know how we were progressing during class.  The smell was so acrid, that I can still remember the smell like it was yesterday - even though it was over 20 years ago.  We didn't breath when she spoke to us (through our noses, that is) - but never mentioned that she was slowly torturing us - simply because she was so sweet.  THAT breath is what this cocoa smells AND tastes like - without exaggeration.  I am a cook, and as previously mentioned used many cocoas over the years, throughout the globe and THIS was the first time experiencing such a.... situation.

I buy cocoa to make my own homemade chocolate syrup for cold milk/ice cream/etc.  Even though the smell of the cocoa was so ""questionable"" - I checked to make sure that it hadn't gone past its expiration date (yes, THAT bad where I had to check) - and decided it may smell/taste better later when I used it.  It didn't.  The smell and taste was just as acrid as I was worried it was going to be.  Wasted so much time and money making this syrup only to have to throw it away because everyone in my family found it disgusting - in every way.  The syrup came out like a dark chocolate, which I liked - but when mixed with milk - it looked like sewage water.  Having to wash out the container the chocolate milk was in, was even more surprisingly gross - like a gray, charcoal-like ash soup... just thinking about it again my stomach is doing flip-flops.  The aftertaste was also much like I had licked an ashtray.  Even after brushing my teeth and tongue - I was still ""experiencing"" the after taste HOURS later.  I was so angry, I ended up throwing everything away - even though I had used the best/highest quality of ingredients in this recipe.

I'm quite surprised the ratings are so high - it is certainly not to my standards - and will be telling all my friends, family, fellow chefs and Amazon family - try if you dare, but don't say I didn't warn you.  Perhaps, if you're making homemade Oreos... or something of that nature that it might be all right - as long as you can find someway of covering up/getting rid of that funky after-taste/smell...";negative

"I drink a lot of iced tea. This is my favorite for making iced tea. I use my electric kettle to boil my water. I take about 7 or 8 tea bags, toss them in my pitcher or a pot, and add a couple of Celestial Seasonings True Blueberry tea bags, and pour in my boiling water. Best iced tea ever.

Update 06/17/2017:
I just purchased this again (this time in family sized bags). Not real impressed. The boxes were covered in tea dust inside the cellophane wrapping. Ditto inside the box. Lots of tea dust. Bags look powdery, too. I have not made iced tea with them yet, but I am expecting lots of silty stuff in my tea.

Won't be buying this again.";negative

I LOVE the powered variety of Oregon Chai, but I can't find any liquid brand that I like as much. In liquid form, they all seem too sweet. I prefer the individually packaged portions. That said, I needed caffeine free chai per doctor's orders, so this will do in a pinch.;negative
"What I like most, and have come to rely on, is the quality and integrity of this product. Ive used this brand for MANY years.
That said, this came in a 12 can case. Of this twelve cans, only FIVE were in good shape. The rest are all dented. As you probably
Know, dented cans are a safety issue sthat can affect the contents. Ive included a photo (the five in the background are the good ones).
I tried to pose the dented sides for viewing but its hard to tell...some of the wrapping is pulled away from the cans, and the dents seem to not show up in the lighting here. In any case, this may be a one time accident by the one who shipped to Amazon , who knows? Bottom line, unless I hear back from the vendor know that there was no attempt to right the wrong and purchase at your own risk. If I DO hear back, Ill revise this review (and stars to reflect it as well).";negative

This is just what it says it is. So no I do not like it XD The flavours are great though, at least the good ones. But in regards of the bottle, sometimes it would get stuck and not come back up, or it'd grab 2 jellies instead of 1 per grab. As for anything else the bad ones are TRULY really BAD. I would not recommend buying if you are sensitive to taste or just don't think you can handle it :s I mean baby diapers?! ugh disgusting! Just add poop flavor while you're at it!;negative

"""LoveTea"" Black Currant packs a caffeine wallop!  Doesn't have the rich fruit flavor I seek.
And ONE STAR for ""LoveTea"" packaging; the resealable zip-closure bag was heat-sealed right down to the zip, making it difficult to open and close.
Was given Black Currant Argo Tea as a gift years ago.  When I was nearly out of my Argo, I found the ""LoveTea"" on Amazon.  It came highly rated by two reviews, so figured I'd give it a shot.  It's just OK in comparison to my Argo thats more flavorful toward the berry/fruitiness.  While the LoveTea smells good and fruity, it's just barely there in the flavor. I'll need to mix this one with another tea in order to enjoy it.";negative

"I discovered Dreamfields pasta years ago, when I was doing Atkins.  I lost 60 pounds going ""low carb,"" and didn't add even this pasta back into my diet until I had reached what was apparently my body's preferred weight.  But I liked the taste and the texture, and the ""5 net digestible carbs"" were irresistible to a low-carb convert like me.

Since then, I have paid HUNDREDS of dollars for HUNDREDS of boxes of Dreamfields pasta. I have fed it to my family, recommended it to low-carbers and diabetics, and eaten it myself.  It tastes great, and surely a good-tasting pasta that delivers on its low-carb promise is worth the premium in price (and the shipping costs you have to pay when you can't find it at your local store!).

The problem, apparently, is that it doesn't actually deliver on that promise.

Today, I came back to Amazon to re-order, and just happened to notice a one-star review that alluded to the ""under-reported lawsuit settlement.""  I did a Web search ... and was stunned to find that in fact, Dreamfields did settle a number of class-action lawsuits purporting that its claims of low digestible carbs and low glycemic index/low blood sugar impact were false back in July.  As part of the settlement, the company agreed to pay out $5 million in refunds (with unclaimed monies being donated to the American Diabetic Association) and has agreed to remove its claims of low digestible carbs from its package labeling for at least a year.

Had I known about the settlement, I would have been entitled to several hundred dollars in refunds.  But I, and probably MOST Dreamfields customers, never even heard about the lawsuit, much less the settlement -- much less received any notice of the deadline for filing a claim -- which for some inexplicable reason, fell only six short weeks after the lawsuit was settled, on September 1, 2014.

It is hard not to feel cynical about a legal system that permits ""notification"" of affected consumers in any manner OTHER than the one most likely to actually reach them -- namely, ON THE PACKAGING OF THE PRODUCT ITSELF -- and particularly one that allows only 6 weeks to get the word out to affected consumers about the deadline for filing a claim.  I have received many class action notices in my life, and I have never seen one with a settlement-to-claim-filing-deadline window this short.

My anger about the class action rip-off aside, I am disappointed to learn that Dreamfields' claims about this product apparently would not hold up to scientific scrutiny (since I cannot imagine why else the company would settle such damaging class action suits) ...

... and I am ESPECIALLY disappointed to learn that the company is still allowed to use the slogan ""Health Carb Living"" on its boxes, particularly given that so many long-term customers, like me, are unlikely to have heard anything about the lawsuit or to study the nutritional label of a product they already ""know"" (and are therefore equally unlikely to notice that the company's substantive claims about the product have melted away).

To all those who said Dreamfields was too good to be true, I bow my head.  Looks like you were right all along.";negative
I agree with the others, the portions are small and for the price it is simply not worth it. I bought this to bring to a friend's house for Christmas and to say the least, I ended up going out and purchasing something else. I would not buy this again for the $25 price tag. If it was 10 or 15 dollars, then this would have gotten a higher review. The chocolate was good, but you expect that when ordering Ghirardelli.  The way is is presented in the description/picture is not the same way it comes in the box -- everything is laid in the basket, and nothing is overflowing out of the basket. (It is a very nice basket, well made) The total height of the basket with everything packaged in is no more than 6 or 7 inches.;negative

I'm not sure what part of this is supposed to be pad thai - the noodles are short and chewy and the flavor pack tastes mainly of salt. I know this is an instant product but I was expecting something that was vaguely close to Pad Thai rather than a bowl of hot water without much flavor. Although this is tagged as vegan, I suspect it's not very healthy since I felt like drinking a gallon of water after eating this.;negative

A lesson: ALWAYS read the side label of ingredients before you rip open a new box . And know that anything that says'' chai spice ingredients'' really means cinnamon because it is cheap. With Now Foods saving all that money by using cheap cinnamon, they cannot even be honest enough to display on the front of the box that it is a BLEND (of like all cinnamon).";negative
Poorly shaped, therefore too hard to remove wrappers. Flavors not evenly distributed. I originally purchased a few of these treats at my local pharmacy - they were in perfect shape with wrappers easily removed. I was disappointed.;negative
Not a huge fan of these. They have a strange, soft, chewy texture. I was expecting the texture to be more like jerky. I also don't think that they really needed to add fruit chunks to these. The lamb is my favorite of them all, but I won't be buying any again.;negative

"This is definitely not what I expected - and that's not because i'm used to poor quality tuna, either.
It was very salty and quite fishy.
In addition, for a product packed in olive oil, I was quite surprised that when put in the fridge, the olive oil didn't solidify at all. That means it's likely a commercially refined oil and health benefits are not particularly high.
It's ok, if mixed with some cream cheese and horseradish to take the edge off - but it's really not that great (particularly for the price). Too bad, because I love the fact that it comes in glass jars that are resealable and that it is clearly chunks/cuts of tuna.";negative

Awesome branding but doesn't follow through with taste or strength.  Coffee came in a box and a bag, which just added to the hype.  It was drinkable coffee, but nothing special.  I'm tempted to take off an additional star for hounding me with emails asking for a review.  I know they are important, but this coffee already has over 3000 reviews.  The annoyance seems unnecessary.;negative
I have tried just about all of the flavors of this stuff and I cannot find one that actually tastes good.  They all have a yucky 'herbal' taste on the back end and I cannot drink them...  Maybe others like the taste...I cannot stomach it...yuck...even Red Bull is vastly superior.;negative
In trying to lose some weight, I decided to try this smart shake because it was good for diabetics.  I did not like it at all!  There was a chalky aftertaste that stayed with me and since it is supposed to be a meal-replacement shake, you would have that taste in your mouth until your next meal.  I could not tolerate that, so I ended up giving them away to others who wanted to try it.  I haven't found anyone yet who likes this product.  I say, save your money and spend it on other brands that taste better!;negative
I really wanted to love these, but nobody's eating them! We love the other brand of these, so thought we'd try these since Sunkist has a good name.  The dark chocolate is a little grainy and the orange jelly us sugary, like when you stir the fudge when it gets stirred and gets sugar crystals instead of a nice smooth consistency.  Sorry, I can't recommend this unless you like grainy chocolate and jelly with sugar crystals in it!;negative

"I apologize to anyone who does not have this taste problem with ""Nu-Salt"".

First let me say, I am trying to reach the US RDA for adults of 4.7g of Potassium per day to combat severe edema. I was rarely salting my foods, but I was hopeful that low potassium (about 2g/day) with above recommended sodium intake (>=1.5g/day, not good) were to blame. Upon finally getting near 4g/day of Potassium including from supplementation, not only did I finally get control over my edema, but I started to experience many positive medical effects that I was ailing from and didn't realize getting the right amount of potassium was such a necessity. (not only do we need 4.7g/day of potassium, but it is necessary to keep the potassium to sodium ratio a little less than 5:1).

Now, I salt my foods with Potassium Chloride when needed (I buy no salt or low salt products now, which I never did before) and put ""better"" salt back in using Potassium Chloride (a potassium salt) further lowering my sodium intake while increasing my potassium intake. A win-win deal. :-)

Just a tip about using Potassium Chloride to replace Sodium Chloride (common table salt): some brands of Potassium Chloride, or potassium based salt... however you want to remember it, have a very thin line for taste tolerance from being just right to overwhelming the taste of the food you are trying to salt it on with an unpleasant metal taste. I found one product on Amazon that has a much greater margin of error when salting with it, which is so helpful, especially when new to using Potassium Chloride to substitute for table salt.

""Nu-Salt"", unfortunately, has that narrow margin of error when salting my foods. If it's low sodium broth or hard boiled eggs, I just add more broth or eggs, but commonly, you can't always correct over salting so easily. I've wasted too much food, even when salting a little, then tasting a little and repeating as needed. That's why I say it is a narrow margin of error, because I so try to not over do it, and then suddenly, with just a little more added, the food taste like metal and I ruined it.

Oh, want to know the Potassium Chloride based salt product I am now using with the wider margin for error when salting my foods? It's ""No Salt"". I won't touch ""Nu-Salt"" anymore. I bought both potassium products from Amazon. I do realize that everyone's tastes are different, so you may actually have a different experience and prefer ""Nu-Salt"". For me, I'm sticking with ""No Salt""... and yes, there is less potassium/gram in ""No Salt"" than in ""NuSalt"", which may be the sole difference in taste for me.

Want to know one of the many unexpected improvements I got when focusing on my Potassium intake and reducing my sodium intake to the ratio of about 5:1, respectively?

Potassium lowers blood pressure; sodium raises it. Yes, I had a nearly instant observation of lower (average) blood pressure when I started to get near the 4.7g/day of Potassium goal (and, respectively, near the almost 5:1 ration of potassium intake to sodium intake. Don't forget, I have mild hypertension and even I noticed a difference. It was only a few digits down on both blood pressure numbers, but I will take it!

I will post pretty much this same review for the ""Alta"" Potassium Chloride pills and the 2 brands of Potassium Chloride salts, ""No Salt"" and ""Nu-Salt"", so if you see my posts repeat itself, please don't get upset with me. I let you know ahead of time. :-)";negative
Had high expectations and ordered 4 different spices from SIMPLY ORGANIC.  Big mistake!  Tried the coriander, thyme, basil etc. Very little or no taste!  Buyer try one spice only, before you spent your money on tasteless herbs!  I enjoy cooking for many many years and will not buy another spice from this company;negative
I soooo wanted to like this.  As a vegetarian with Celiac Disease it checked all the necessary boxes but the taste and texture were just so not what I expected.  I guess I've gotten spoiled by our nearby Indian restaurant.  I'll have to keep going there for my spinach and paneer fix.;negative
These were great at first, but then they started causing stomach issues (ate them for breakfast for a week). Probably not a concern for most people since I have an insanely sensitive stomach. They taste great and are awesome for travel, which sucks since I can't tolerate them.;negative
"I am an experienced bread maker and was attracted by the ease of these directions. I should know better. First I made the rye loaf, exactly as directed, and IT DIDN'T RISE AT ALL.  It actually came out like a brick both in shape and consistency. Just awful. Had to be thrown out. I thought maybe I had old inventory and the included yeast may have been past date so I made another one of the three bags and this time I added my own brand new yeast.  Another fail -- it rose to about a 2"" height. Again it had a disgusting consistency and this time the baked bread smelled like old socks (that was the Italian herb loaf). I'm throwing out the third loaf. Not worth trying to make. Really gross results. I do not understand the positive reviews this bread mix has ... I'm wondering if they're real...";negative
"I just made two cups of espresso and was not impressed. It does leave similar taste as Kona (for me at least) and I am not a fan of Kona either. Kona's especial taste seems to be rooted in its lava nitrogen rich ground but I don't know why JBM taste that (I wonder though).

I usually sniff very deeply first to get a feeling about the beans and I did not get much from this one (this always remind me of Chromatography and how if you continue sniffing, you would discover new smells).

As for the flavor, it was not that prominent/memorable either.

Brief, I would not entertain ordering this again.

PS: I have not idea how this would turn as a regular coffee since I don't drink my coffee regular.";negative

I give this item 1 star  solely because the description for item, and the packaging shows 2 different amount....header states 2 ibs.......picture shows 3 ibs...i did not really pay attention to header description.....just read back & front label on product..... so i called amazon & the customer service lady said its suppose to be 3 ibs as shown in picture....well i recieved a 2 ib bag....so she took care of the situation like a professional ......she also stated she would report this era to the approperiate channels..i would refrain from purchasing this item until the era is corrected..... the picture shows what i recieved the other picture is what i should have recieved.;negative
I thought I would give these a try since the regular raw cacao nibs brand by Healthworks was out of stock. These had a horrible vinegar smell, and had no taste whatsoever. Looks like they weren't fermented and dried properly. I was really disappointed with these, and won't be buying this brand again. :(;negative
"These lentils might be non-gmo but they are not organic.  This from the Paolouse Brand  website -

""The farm operation has been using the latest in sustainable agricultural practices. We have been using Direct Seeding and NO-Till practices since 1982. These changes have greatly reduced soil erosion, have increased soil health and helped us control our cost in an ever-rising input cost environment. In 2006 we became ""Food Alliance"" certified.""

No-till means they do not break the soil to plant and cultivate the crop.  Instead they rely on chemicals like Monsanto's Roundup to control weeds. Why would you pay a premium for lentils that are drenched in herbicide?  I bought five lbs. because I did an Amazon search for organic lentils and these came up.  This is not the first time that Amazon has misrepresented the organic label on its website. These lentils are probably no better or worse than the brands you can buy in Walmart. I won't be buying them again and we need to get hold of Amazon's customer relations and tell them that unless products are carrying the USDA Organic label they should not come up on a search for ""organic"".  Organic farmers go through a lot of hoops and expense to get certified with that label and they are limited in what they can apply or feed and how they must grow their product.  It cannot start from GMO modified seed or livestock.  This adds expense to their final product that is not justified by mainstream ag-industry practices that are looking at their bottom line and producing as much food as they can as cheaply as possible.  They are taking advantage of  premium organic pricing by being faux organic, ie, ""Natural"" or ""Food Alliance Certified"".";negative
"I HATE paying the $3.50/$4.00 for those little shots of 24 Hour Energy at the convenience store.  So when I saw this comparable product at a much better price, I thought I would give it a go.  The price is great, but I just gotta say the Red Rain shots did very little for me.  I have no idea why.  I resorted to drinking two of them at once.

Kind of a bummer. I'm a bit of a caffeine junkie.  A giant iced coffee in the morning.  The big Red Bull or an energy shot late in the day.  For all of its hefty price, the actual 24 Hour Energy shots REALLY work well in my experience.  No jitters or anything and a noticeable pick up.  I really got nothing out of the Red Rain energy shots at all which is too bad.

The taste is okay.  If you're less used to these types of energy drinks, maybe this will be more effective for you.  I'm going to assume though that the type of person who buys a 24 pack like this drinks these frequently.";negative
IT'S SO-SO;negative
Although item was not expired.  It tasted stale and not as crunchy anymore.  Seems like item was stored incorrectly. I also ordered the same product from a seller (Ebay)  that ships directly from Hawaii and you can definitely taste the difference of how much better and fresh it is.;negative
"I purchased these because it says 4000mg daily. Gee... Then 1000mg pills arrive. Directions say take two daily. 2000mg. What happened to the 4000mg daily? I was trying to purchase larger mg pills. I despise being deceived by companies. Be truthful, state on the label how many mg is in EACH pill. This is a problem with calcium pills as well.

Pills are fine, smell fresh. There was no problems with the pills at all. I will take this bottle and be done with them. I prefer to use a brand that tells the truth on the label vs trying to make their pills seem like a ""better bargain"".

I will take them, but it is deceptive advertising. Buyer beware. I will not purchase from this company again.";negative
"I'm not a fan of sugar substitute. If you like sugar substitutes, this one is not bad. I don't need sugar substitutes and don't want them in my food intake. This would have been an amazingly good drink if not for the subtle hint of sugar substitute in every sip. They really should plaster a big sugar substitute somewhere on the labeling. The 100% juice is a LIE and no sugar added is another lie because they only tell you half the truth about adding sugar substitute.

The sugar substitute used is Rebiana a Stevia extract. This is a type of fruit extracted sweetener, so they claim 100% fruit because the sugar substitute is derived from fruit, FALSE FALSE FALSE advertising. I had to strain my eyes to read the ingredients on the can to find that information, nowhere, anywhere on the packaging does it state that. I am sorely disappointed with V8 company for deceptively tricking me into buying something I did not want. You can google Rebiana to learn more. I'm sure it's great for people that want a sugar substitute, but that is not me.";negative
"Yuck! I didn't notice a ""bad"" taste... but the texture! I made a pancake. The batter would not cook up. The pancake kept falling apart. I tried in anyway, and the texture made me want to gag. It was gritty and dry... and just plain weird! It was not at all like dough. I would rather not eat a pancake than to eat this! For other cravings, I prefer low carb tortillas.";negative
They taste horrible;negative
At least they taste fresh? For the amount of sodium that is in this(960mg, 40% of your daily value), you would think it would be super flavorful. Nope. It was terrible. I was trying to find something quick, easy, and tasty being a nursing mother. I'd rather cook a whole meal with a screaming baby than eat this again and it's unfortunate that I bought 2. This gives healthy eating a bad name.;negative
"***This is just an alert I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER IN HOT TEXAS***

First off I really do LOVE these cookies under normal circumstances. This batch arrived a gooey melted chocolately mess. Putting them in the refrigerator upon arrival did firm up the chocolate BUT the Milano experience wasn't the usual pleasant one.

***This is just an alert I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER IN HOT TEXAS***";negative
Really harsh and bitter flavor. Strongly recommend that you avoid it. Other brands, such as Bigelow, are far superior if you favor of mellow flavor. Mine did not come in a nice box as shown, but seem to be thrown together in a generic cardboard box, so I had to find better packaging for it in my kitchen.;negative
Frozen during delivery;negative
I bought this with high expectations from all the positive reviews. I don't care for it. I wish I wouldn't have gotten a whole case. I like my cappuccino with a creamy consistency. I feel like no matter how much of this I add, it keeps a watered down taste. Will not get again.;negative
I noticed nothing. Just gum.;negative

This tea is very weak and not very flavorful. I have to use at least a tablespoon of tea with infused and steep for at least 5 minutes and it is okay (not great but okay). It was the only loose decaf English breakfast I could find, but honestly a Twining tea bag is better. The best loose tea I've bought is Twinings English breakfast tea (I only have to use a flat teaspoon and it's delicious and plenty strong/flavorful) but I can't get it in decaf.;negative

I love the regular style Pop Chips so when these were a Deal of the Day I grabbed a case of them. That was a mistake because these are gross.

I guess I'll take them to work because those people will snack on anything when it's free!;negative
They are hard and stale, and the chocolate coating is waxy, do not buy these. and the seller lied on the page saying they are always fresh, They aren't, even though they are not past the expiration date, these are completely inedible.;negative
First off, I LOVE this drink. I am addicted and have probably gone through at least six packs of twelve. In other words, a LOT. Then, duh, I read the fine print and discovered that this is a product of Taiwan. Taiwan has had a history of food safety problems. Talk about disappointed! I am wondering what kind of safety control is in place when this product is imported into the United States? If anyone knows, I welcome the information. In the absence of reassurance, I am afraid I've placed my last order for this yummy stuff.;negative

"Heads up...because now this product...clearly labeled ""KELP GRANULES""...IS a BLEND!!!

I have eaten this product of kelp for many years...BUT now it is heavily mixed with alaria (wakame) another sea vegetable...and this product no longer tastes like the IODINE-rich, knock-your-socks-off tasting kelp that it used to be! The taste of the kelp used to SUPER iodine-y...and that's a GREAT thing...which means it was unadulterated kelp.

Shame on you Maine Coast Sea Seasonings...BIG disappointment in yet another ""health"" company going sketchy and gypping its loyal customers by totally downgrading the formula and keeping the news of its reformulation/BLEND a tiny footnote...while keeping the large label ""KELP Granules"" on the front of the container as it has been all these years.

Honestly folks, this blend tastes like a mere shadow of how these PURE KELP GRANULES used to taste (and is supposed to taste). This product used to only contain dark, potent-tasting kelp...period. The taste was powerful! Now it is dialed back about 50% due to weaker blend of alaria. Hey? Did you think we wouldn't notice Maine Coast Sea Seasonings? Or, just hope we didn't care?

At least change your label to be honest about your KELP BLEND Granules.

PS, Amazon, as usual, was totally gracious in letting me return this item when I realized these 6 containers of Kelp...were a blend of kelp...and not the original product I thought I was ordering.";negative
"I wholeheartedly agree with another reviewer katogrey that this product in no way compares to the Rishi Tea Organic  Green Tea Jasmine Pearl product which I enjoyed for years.  Like katogrey, I too ordered it on subscribe and save of the Jasmine Pearl product and was notified that it was no longer available so I ordered this 'non-pearl' product.

This product is a different grade which is OJT-OP (per wiki which says ""OPmain grade, in the middle between OP1 and OPA, can consist of long wiry leaf without tips"").  The end brewed result is a slightly bitter taste flat taste with barely a hint of the jasmine flower aroma.

I will cancel my subscribe and save on this product and hunt down the Jasmine Pearl.  It might sound a bit corney and commercial-like, but after a hectic getting breakfast ready for the millionth time morning, I sit down to my cup of Rishi Jasmine Pearl tea, close my eyes and transport to a wonderful place that smells like Jasmine flowers and tastes like dancing green tea.";negative
Kitchen Basics is NO LONGER IN EXISTANCE.

I've eaten a lot of macadamia nuts in my days, but these were the worst I've tasted. Zero flavor, smelled like play-dough upon opening the bag. They just didn't seem fresh, borderline rancid/stale.

I ordered this with high hopes, given all the good reviews.  But unfortunately I have to agree with A Consumer that this product doesn't seem to have any chocolate flavor at all.

"Although this is obviously a quality product, it is not at all like the photo on the front of the packaging.  It is very misleading, as well as the fact that pricing is about a dollar an ounce.  The weight is mostly wet salt, so that you are not getting anywhere near the same amount of vegetables as 14 ounces dry weight.  The seaweed is in very large wide leaves that are dark green, and do expand quite a bit after rehydration.  The leaves stay dark green even after blanching and refrigerating as suggested on the website recipes.  They do not turn a bright green at all.  Perhaps fresh seaweed turns a bright green after blanching, same as other vegetables, but not after it is dried and salted.

The leaves are tender and mild, like a spinach or kale, and will pick up the flavor of the dressing.  They are not fishy tasting and are not slimy, at least not after being blanched.  Since this is really fairly enjoyable, I gave it two stars.  But I won't be buying it again.  I can get fresh spinach and fresh kale a lot less expensive than from New Zealand.

I am still very disappointed that this is not the product shown on the packaging.  And I would really like to know where to get that one, bright green, tender threads like I have enjoyed elsewhere.";negative

We love fruitcake and decided to try a small  1 lb Trappist cake first because the order was pricey at $26.  We were disappointed in the cake.  It was dry and tasted like sawdust. Even though it says it is soaked in brandy, there was NO flavor what so ever. After slicing off one small piece for each of us we put the rest in the trash. Live and learn.  I trust Amazon products but this one was very poor quality.;negative

"Granted I have never had a chestnut before so my ignorance is profound in the area of comparison (& maybe a fair review), however this is what I can say regarding this product...
1) Roasted does not equate to crunchy goodness. These nuts have the texture of being boiled and have a waxy coat on them like apples from the store
2) The smell will take your breath away-literally! My husband took some heavy convincing to even try them...I had to apologize to him and my father for having tried them. They taste like old spoiled MOLDY peas and the flavor does NOT leave your mouth or nasal cavity. I tried to blend them in a chocolate vanilla protein smoothie and it masked most but not all.
3) and perhaps most importantly I could not find and expiration date anywhere so they could have actually expired and there was no way to know.
4)There are 5 or 6 bags so....if this is a trial run to experience chestnuts for the first time I would really pass.

Again I have no previous experience with a chestnut but I will say Im done for life on ever trying one again I think. I rated two stars bc I don't know what a chestnut should taste like but when 3 of us cant stomach them I just have to think they aren't good.";negative
It arrived in the 'ready for shipping box' only the outside of the box was damp in places and the inside was very soaked from the leakage of the creamers.  I have had to throw many away and some are not easy to see why they are leaking.  For some reason the seal tops are on but not adequately and I go put into my coffee or tea and I get a clump of mucous like substance instead of creamer in my drink...another waste...that is not going to pass my lips.  I love the creamers, love the subscription program as I change flavors and mix and match...plus I don't have a refrigerator so please do note this review is for this one delivery only, all other times I have been happy, but they all came double boxed and in good condition and most enjoyable.  Amazon has never let me down before on my creamer purchases this time just a mishap...;negative
"If it is doing me any good I cannot tell it. It is a very refreshing drink when I mix 2 tablespoons of it with 2 tablespoons of lemon juice, 1 teaspoon of Ceylon cinnamon, 2  tiny measures of Stevis which is probably 1/16th of a teaspoon or less.

Sure enough, it passes all the ""real olive oil tests"" like being able to burn it, and seeing the thickness... so on..  but man, it is soooooooo bitter. If this is what real olive oil tastes like, i'm guessing i'm going back to the fake stuff.

I wrote the company to tell them about how I did not like the changes they made a couple of years ago to this product.  The texture and quality are different and the packaging has changed, and NOT for the better. This WAS our family's favorite graham cracker. They told me they changed production and there was no going back to the old way.  Too bad, they lost a customer. Also, the last case I received went rancid before the expiration date.  I store these in my pantry, which is cool and dry.  Not sure why that happened, but it was a waste. They also arrive very cracked and broken, due to the way they are packaged. I won't be buying these anymore.;negative

"The taste just isn't nearly as good as other brands. I have to use about twice as much to make a matcha latte that tastes like anything, but then it tastes awful. Burnt flavor, nothing like the matchas I've had in the past. I tried returnung, but returns are not accepted so I just threw away $17. What a waste.

Edit: I contacted the company and they issued a refund. They did say I might like their ceremonial grade instead of culinary but I don't see culinary specified anywhere on the listing. The listing does say it's great for tea or matcha lattes, which it isn't, and them saying that lead me to believe it was drinking quality. I don't believe I would enjoy cooking with it either.";negative
This product tastes like old spice (or what I expect old spice to taste like) - was like drinking tea made with the bags as opposed to what's in them. I tried multiple steeping options - and up to 4 bags at once to attempt a different taste and especially a stronger brew. That didn't help. It was just a watered down old-spice tasting mess. Ordered from Amazon itself, so there's no returning - and as I've done before, wouldn't want to resell this crap to anyone else. What's lower than 1 star?;negative
"This is one of those scam products that uses the name of something that isn't actually contained in the product. Despite the name ""chipotle,"" it contains no chipotle peppers. The first ingredient by weight is salt, so if you have any concerns about your sodium intake or your general health, avoid this product altogether. Fool me once, right, but I'm also kind of shocked that Amazon would sell a food product, or allow it to be sold, without access to the ingredients list. It's like shopping in the 19th century; buyer beware, because there's no way to know what's in it from the online listing.";negative

"I've tried a couple of other Dr. McDougall entrees that were pretty good for fast food in a cup where you just add boiling water.  But this one really misses the mark.  First, the mushy little noodles don't taste anything like Pad Thai.  It looks and tastes like some brown gravy-ish thing, not particularly terrible but not particularly great either.  When I first opened the cup and saw less than 2 inches of noodles on the bottom, I thought, ""Wow, these things must really expand a lot to fill the cup!""  But after adding the powdered sauce packet, pouring in the boiling water, and letting it sit for about 5 minutes....nope, still about 2 inches of noodles and that was it!  Way overpriced for just under $2 per cup.  I think Dr. McDougall needs to go back to the test kitchen on this one.";negative
"I missed that it had stevia in it.  I'm not a big fan of stevia as it tastes funny, but not sweet to me. So this product does not taste as good as crystal light's raspberry lemonade to me.  But it is all subjective as everyone likes different things.

I normally put one packet in my 32 oz water bottle. The crystal light, Target and Walmart brands taste perfect in it. Not a strong flavor,  but I definitely taste it.  Similar to flavored water.

I'm not sure if I got a bad batch, but the jar of the classic gourmet sauerkraut I got smelled like old socks.  Didn't taste good either.  I guess I should count myself as lucky as even though I ordered two jars of the classic, they messed up my order and gave me one jar of the classic and one of some other type I didn't order and a third jar of another type I did order.

"I was actually quite disappointed with this product.  I have fond memories of my brother and I, as children, making and imbibing Fizzies soft drinks.  I mentioned it to my husband and, sure enough, he had fond memories of the product as well.  Seems as though every baby boomer recalls Fizzies and has something to say about it - usually good.  Well, I guess this is one of those cases where a memory is best left to just that.  What is that old adage - ""you can never go home.....etc.

I was thrilled when the Fizzies arrived - imagining this delightful, good-tasting drink from my (very distant) past.  What's more Fizzies is calorie-free - I can drink as much as I would like. Yeah!  Well, then, - plop .... fizz, fizz (it does DOES fizz, just as I recall) and then I took a sip.  Yikes!  This stuff is absolutely awful - nothing like I recall.  Did we really drink this stuff?  It tastes like baking soda in water only worse because it has a dreadful after taste from the sweetener, as well.  I had all I could do not to spit it out into the sink.  Somehow, I do not recall Fizzies tasting anything like this.  This just can't be the drink we relished as children - either that or our tastes have morphed considerably.  Most likely they changed the recipe and formulation when the whole saccharine issue caused it to go out of existence the first time.  I can't recall whether or not it was calorie-free back then. Such issues were simply not relevant to young children.  As for now, I am thinking that perhaps it can be used in lieu of a baking soda rinse - recommended by some dentists for people with gum disease.

If you enjoyed Fizzies as a youngster, my recommendation to you would be to leave Fizzies to dwell in your mind as an memory.  I don't think you will like its current incarnation.  My box (yes box - they sell it only in bulk) is now in AZ where I will be working again come Fall.  Were that not the case, I would happily send the box or a sample there of to any one who requests it.  For all I know, you may love Fizzies and think it is the greatest thing since pimento loaf (with sliced bread).  Somehow, though, I do not think such will be the case.  I am fairly easy to please when it comes to food and beverage - I like just about everything in that domain but I certainly do NOT like Fizzies.  I would strongly recommend that you find Fizzies locally and buy a SMALL box of it before ordering it on Amazon where only the larger quantities are for sale.";negative
We have tried and tried to like this so we would not waste it but it just is not right. We have even tried giving it away but once they try it they don't want it either. If you have tried it and like it, leave your address and I will send you ours!;negative

"I received this bag, and while the bag states it's certified organic, nowhere on the packaging is there any USDA seal or world certification seal or any other seal to verify that this popcorn is indeed certified organic. The USDA recommends not buying products that don't have these seals as ""the seal is intended to assure quality and prevent fraud."" In this case, I am highly suspicious of the deceptive marketing practices of this product and do not know if this produce is indeed organic as advertised. I am returning it for a full refund.";negative
I'm a coffee drinker and have tried various brands.  The price was great for this but in the variety pack there might have been a few 'bold brew' that tasted like coffee.  The others were incredibly weak.  The flavored coffees were awful.  Would not recommend this to anyone that enjoys coffee.;negative
"Though the company says it was fresh; it tasted rancid to me. I think they could find a better way to package this oil so it arrives in better condition. For my money, I'll look to a health food store near me for future purchases. This stuff just doesn't travel well through the postal system. Maybe if they packed it in ice it would stay fresh in transit.
Saving grace: I make soap at home, and turned this into a bar of soap my sweetie loves.";negative
Meh. Love the package, a soft squeeze bottle which makes it very easy to manage with one hand. But the taste, not so much. I was hopeful that the MSG content would mean the flavor was lively and fresh. But its heavy, dull, very chemical in smell and taste. Even the aftertaste is a disappointing experience. Homemade is best, Hellman's is second best. This is just weird.;negative
We bought these to use at church for the Lord's Supper on Sundays (Acts 20:7) and I didn't mind at all that every box of bread was a little burned. Some of the older people at church were really mad that it was burned and we ended up not using five of the six boxes, so it was a HUGE waste of money.  They taste just fine but the burned parts really bothered a lot of people in our congregation.;negative
It doesn't fit my Keurig.;negative
Normally, I love THE REPUBLIC OF TEA brand. IMO - This LEAN GREEN tea is DISGUSTING Im disappointed and won't drink it. I still have it, I won't toss it out but 2 stars is a kind rating.  Drink at your own risk, it has a strange taste- aftertaste.;negative
upon the research of histamine intolerance, i tried 1/4 tsp of this in plain water. withing 45 minutes i broke out in hives and my tongue swelled up. i had an allergic reaction to only a very small amount of this;negative
"PLEASE DO NOT STOP HERE. This stuff is far more like Miracle Whip than it is Hellmans. Even though is says it's ""REAL"" mayo, it's FAR from it.

It's vile, IMHO, but I have the same opinion of Miracle Whip, too. If you like that stuff, I am pretty sure you'll like this.

The price is good, but it's not good if you can't stomach the product. This will be tossed, sadly. I can't eat it!";negative
This is nothing like the other Terrasoul vanilla bean powder I bought two years ago. And that product is no longer available here on Amazon. This stuff is brown just like the Sunny Day Organic vanilla bean powder, which is also terrible, not much vanilla flavor!!  I hope I can find the original Terrasoul vanilla bean powder which was black, like a vanilla bean is, and had oodles of vanilla flavor!!;negative
"When I bought these preserves, they came really well packed - wrapped securely in lots of bubble wrap. As I was unraveling the bubble wrap, I saw something black... which when looking closer was very obviously a whole, winged insect. I have pictures (which I'll look at posting here). The company apparently didn't care - I sent this all to them (very obviously their unopened product). I really wanted to try cloudberry, but no way I'm touching this stuff or anything of their brand (even though I realize that in eating anything canned/jarred, I probably eat insect garbage all the time - I still should never see a whole insect floating around in my food). I also notice this stuff is very runny - just an observation of the jar & something that might be helpful to anyone who might buy it.

(P.S. Amazon, of course, is awesome and refunded my money, telling me to go ahead and dispose of it)";negative
Received wrong item;negative
meh.  pretty tastless;negative
"Waay too salty, and the ""butter flavor"" comes off as being filled with sad margarinelike chemicals. Not something I would order again...Now I water it down a LOT to get a reasonable flavor...Next time, a bit less ""flavoring,"" and LESS touting that it has a ""butttery"" flavor, which it certainly does NOT have at all...Actually, this is the WORST food product I have EVER gotten from Amazon. Just terrible tasting. I wound-up just throwing these OUT, as the taste was too TERRIBLE....Just bad flavor, masking any true grit flavor.";negative
I received this item in Aug 1. I looked at it and was pleased with the selection. Then I started looking at the 'best used by' dates, the cookies and peanuts, etc. are fine. The chips expire on either Aug 1 or Aug 15!  Aug 15 is bad enough, but to expire on the day they were received is unacceptable. Buyer beware!;negative
i searched amazon for gluten free gochujang and this came up.  no gluten or wheat was listed under ingredients.  when the product arrived, the very first ingredient on the label was wheat.  i can not use this as intended.  WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!;negative
it was the most expensive water enhancer and the taste was not what I call tasty, matter of fact it was not that good. the one was kind of tasteless the other was very bitter.  I have 3 more to go which I am not looking forward to.  It also only was good for 5 glasses but I think I used more than I should but I wanted to get a flavor taste;negative
Bala Sarda the founder will send you an email telling you how great their tea is and will refund your money if you don't like it. When you respond to the email, they don't bother to answer. Some of their teas are quite good but this one is not. Its worse than Lipton and a lot more money. Their customer service stinks.;negative
"So I had just finished my third 1KG box of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/China-Green-Tea-Special-Gunpowder-1-Kilo-1000grams-or-35-27-Oz-Guaranteed-Authenticity/dp/B0009X65FC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">China Green Tea Special Gunpowder 1 Kilo (1000grams or 35.27 Oz) Guaranteed Authenticity</a>&nbsp;in the last year and decided to see if this Davidson's was any better.  To my dismay, it's not, but it sure costs a lot more!  After four brews with the Davidson's, I'm very dissatisfied.

First off, the color of the gunpowder pellets are no different between samples, but the Davidson's uses bigger pellets, meaning bigger, older fan leaves.  The Temple of Heaven (ToH) gunpowder green uses smaller leaves, so when you brew there appear to be many more leaves because there are.  The Davidson's often has several leaves and their attached stem rolled up into a single pellet.  The Davidson's also has significantly more dirt, dust, and loose stems in the package.  In fact, it looks like I got the bottom of the barrel.

****  Your Quality Control Is Terrible, Davidson!  ****

The idea that it is organic should have some impact on the flavor, but the Davidson's is more bitter, and the tea is orange/yellow after 3 minutes of brewing in RO filtered water heated to 170-180F in a French press.  The ToH tea is a greenish yellow, and has a better flavor with less bitterness.

Overall, I am very unhappy with my Davidson's purchase.  The ToH gunpowder green is better quality for less than half the price!!!

When compared to the other gunpowder green tea options available, Davidson's Gunpowder Green Tea is a 2 star gunpowder green tea for flavor that loses a star for poor pricing and very poor quality control.";negative
"This was 5.5 oz.  I did not know how big a bag 5.5 oz would fill.  It is a small bag.  And they charged $15.99 for it.  I thought maybe it would be huge, not knowing how many lemonheads would be in a 5.5oz bag.  This is ridiculous.  I got the same size bag of Brach lemon hard candy for $2.14.

Do not buy this as it is outrageously priced.";negative
Did not like it as all!;negative
"This appears to have a good blend of flavored and regular decaf coffees.  Don't believe it!  It is just a collection of different regular decaf coffees.  The entire pack contained only 4 flavored coffees out of 30.  A waste of money!  If you want a decent combination, stay away from this ""variety sampler pack"".  You won't get genuine variety.";negative
"We've tried many Martha White corn bread mixes and I really like the product. This one has a funny undertaste, can't explain it, it almost tastes like molasses.  I think we'll pass on this one. Oh and one more thing; the expiration date is August of this year.";negative

"No MSG, no hormones, no antibiotics, makes for a great purchase in my book.  So why only two stars?  Unfortunately, after giving Golden Valley a chance with both this and their&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sweet-N-Spicy/dp/B000E4ARBE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sweet N' Spicy</a>&nbsp;flavor I couldn't make myself enjoy the taste.  The texture is strange, it reminds me of chewing cube steak.  You know it's beef but you also know it's a little too chewy to be steak.  It's possible people who like their steak rare may enjoy the chewy texture as it's not too tough as far as beef jerky goes.  Plus, something about the flavorings they use gives the meat a sour, almost rancid taste.  I'm guessing it's the apple cider vinegar as it reminds me of fruit or apple juice that's turning bad. They need to improve their flavors before I try them again.";negative
tropicana is usually a great product, however, I do not recommend purchasing this product. By the time it gets to you, it taste like it has been heated and  cooled down a couple times. Does not taste good at all.;negative
"I have since changed my opinion of these rice cakes.  They are satisfactory but not great.  However, the newest variety (to me) is Corn, Quinoa and Sesame.  Now these are good and I'm ordering a case of them (as soon as I finish off the plain old white rice ones).
  My comments of last year:  Disappointing to say the very least.  No flavor at all.  The texture is almost strange, like biting into a bit of squeaky plastic.  But, with butter and salt they become somewhat acceptable ONLY IF one is starving.  I'm disgusted that I ordered a whole case of them (based on great recommendations here at Amazon); the rest of the case (of 11) just might just go to the local food bank.  The size is different and they are fairly sturdy.  And, too the packaging is not easily closeable, requiring a plastic bag to keep them fresh.  Also, this case was more expensive than other brands.  Even the el cheapo Quaker rice cakes are better than these.
  My absolute favorite would be Real Food Rice Thins (whole grain) - a bit more flavor and different texture and a bit more expensive here at Amazon.  My former fave was Lundberg's variety of rice cakes; great variety and some are organic.  However, they are way too fragile and break into many pieces.  I call them my kitchen sink snack since that's the only place to eat them without scattering crumbs throughout half the house.  I've complained to the company to no avail so that's just the way they are.  It is a fine product even though they are so fragile and crumble just getting them out of the package.  I've almost given up on them in favor of Rice Thins.";negative
"NOT the old fashioned candy of yesteryear!  This is broken pieces of

For years I would purchase Applets and Cotlets when visiting family in Seattle. The family has moved and no more Applets & Cotlets. I was happy to see that they were available through Amazon. Imagine my surprise to find the box contained hard pieces of my once favorite fruit candy. The best used date on package indicated September 2017. I suspect these were produced a year ago and sat on a warehouse shelf for close to 10 months. Learned my lesson: either travel to WA state or order directly from Liberty Farms.;negative
I love chocolate-flavored coffee, and this is the 11th brand I've tried.  The picture on this package got me off to a bad start by reminding me of those commercial donuts with frosting that looks like plastic and chips off.  But the flavor of the coffee is the real problem.  At first it seemed like there was a hint of coconut, but it ended up tasting like some chemical, even after I added milk.  I tasted little if any chocolate flavor, and it was so subtle that the chemical taste overpowered it.  This is adequate if all you need is a morning dose of caffeine.  If you want to try a new brand of chocolate coffee with rich flavor and no aftertaste, I would recommend Millstone Chocolate Velvet coffee instead.;negative

These taste terrible. Way overpriced, with the high price tag I was really expecting these to be good, they were a HUGE disappointment. The worst part is I forgot to cancel my subscription and now I have another inedible box of these things that I wouldn't even pawn off on my co-workers. They tasted nothing like any shortbread I have ever had, seriously I think cardboard would taste better. They are hard as a brick and the only way we were able to eat them at all was soaking them in milk and that didn't help much. I ended up throwing them away. There was one flavor (I don't know which one) that tasted so bad all of that flavor was thrown away.;negative
Inedible.  This licorice is horrible.  It's a teeny, tiny box of hard tooth breaking pellets and the taste is rancid.  I ate one tiny piece and spit it out and had to rinse my mouth.  If I could give it 0 stars I would.  I'm serious -- don't  buy this.;negative
This oil doesn't smell good. I ordered it to use for cooking or as a dietary supplement but I didn't like its smell and also it feels like it has a granular texture, you feel like you have tiny pieces of crystals in your mouth. I didn't return because I opened it a little late and now I will be using it for my skin and hair. It is not eating quality I think. I used much better brands so I know how a good quality coconut oil tastes, smells or feels.;negative
I don't know if I received a bad lot or what.  I read the many reviews that said this was creamy and delicious.  Not here!  Mine is gritty and makes my mouth all dry like I eaten a persimmon that's not ripe yet.;negative
"I read many positive and negative reviews about the flavor, in my case the vanilla, but I decided to give it a try for myself.  I could never have imagined how awful this product would taste.  I have taken many, many supplements, but nothing I have ever tasted compares to the terrible flavor of this protein powder.  It is pretty close to undrinkable, and it is difficult to hide the ""unique"" flavor by adding other ingredients.  My suggestion would be to try something else, anything else.";negative
"UPDATE: Since becoming Karen's Naturals these are not the same. The 2 bags I purchased under this new name are mostly dried red peppers. Very little corn, carrots, or peas. I won't be buying these again.

Purchased for my 4 lovebirds to give them a bit of variety in treats. They quite like the Just Veggies, and I have been giving this to them for quite a while. I sometimes add dried red/green/jalapeno flakes that I pick up at Penzey's. The birds are fond of this treat. They are also fond of dropping bits of the Just Veggies on the cat as he passes by.";negative
"I was unpleasantly surprised when I first tried this coffee (Ordered two large cans of the stuff).  It's just plain bad.  There is very little or no caffeine  buzz going on, which is odd for 100% Columbian. As far as ""Supremo Bean"" is concerned, I would really hate to try their ""regular bean"".  Very rough, agonizing taste over-all.  I would have sent it back if that wasn't such a hassle.  We though about donating the remaining unopened can to a local church, but than we decided that would be cruel. So, live and learned.  Very shocked that Costco would put their label on this product. As other reviewers have said, maybe I got a bad batch?";negative
Not to my taste.;negative
"Somehow I knew I'd come to regret paying 11.00 for a 2-pack of taco shells.
Since changing to a low carb way of eating I have had to give up tortillas & taco shells but when I found these shells I thought of how nice it would be to have a low carb taco shell option for mexican dinners with the family. With only 4 grams of carbs per shell these seemed like a great option but are not sold in my area so I was prepared to pay a bit more to order them online.
They arrived 2 days later (I love you, Amazon Prime.) so I went ahead and put together a taco night feast fit for a king. When I opened the first box my heart sank. I could see even through the shrink-wrap that what I had was essentially a bag of crumbs. I opened the second box and found the majority of shells were broken but managed to salvage a few. Of the 24 total shells, only 6 were even remotely usable.  I don't usually include photos in my reviews but I felt that THIS TIME it would be a good idea to show potential customers what they will be working with. The first image depicts one of the lone surviving low carb shells alongside the shells my family usually eats. As you can see, the La Tiara shells would fit nicely in the hands of a toddler....or a Barbie. These aren't low carb because someone tweaked a regular shell recipe, they are low carb because they are tiny and as you can see in the second photo, paper thin. The few shells intact enough to even hold any meat at all disintegrated within moments of being filled.
But hey, at least they tasted terrible.
No, on second thought...""terrible"" is not entirely accurate. To taste terrible they would have to actually HAVE a flavor. These wafer-thin, fragile, teeny little pseudo-shells taste like I'd rather be fat.";negative
Not really good;negative
Chocolate????;negative
Absolute Worst product ever! There was so much salt in this product that it had to be returned. Amazon was very nice and submitted a refund since this product was not edible at all. I had gotten this for my husband since he likes to eat them as a snack. He had to spit it out! I would not recommend these to anyone and I would not even try to cook with them. Horrible product! The salt in this product burned our tongue it was so bad.;negative
"I have come to the conclusion that THE only way to get delicious Hummus is from a Greek restaurant.  Wild Garden?  It was about as ""wild"" as a blade of grass.  Terrible flavor & texture. UGH - does anyone know of any brand, of Hummus, that actually taste good?

I've tried making my own - not even close to a decent taste. Yes, I used Tahini.  People tell me I'm a ""amazing cook"" - I will feel ""amazing"" when I can make a simple, yet superior, Garlic Hummus!

Sadly, we live over a hours drive to a decent Greek restaurant.  I have tried brands from the refrigerator section and those that do not require refrigerating until you open it.  All terrible. Moving to Greece not a option. (Husband not receptive to this option)

The absolute best Hummus I've had was at the restaurant in the Doubletree Hotel - Times Square - NYC.  Being I live in CA - well, no chance of getting some soon.  Anyone have a really good garlicky recipe?  Woman on a quest here for plain, super garlicky Hummus.  No 'extra' flavors thrown in - I think I have tried over twenty different brands.  :-(

Anyway, if you love Hummus forget this brand.";negative
I know its supposed to be a health food product but it spreads, smells and probably tastes like that stuff guys use to grease car parts.  The taste is awful.  I haven't a clue how you could possibly disguise it.  My brilliant thought was to add it to a baked product and then read how others did this and it ruined the baked goods.  I don't bake enough to be that adventurous or wasteful.  If you get it on your fingers or face, good luck getting it off.  You will be orange tinged for the remainder of the day.  There must be some way to use it but honestly, outside of car parts I really don't know.;negative
This product has an odd taste.;negative
"I bought this unsweetened because I need to stay away from sugar as much as possible. I have bought other products by this compqny and was happy with them. However,  however, this is definitely not my cup of tea (pun intended). The flavor is very weak and the lemon flavor in it overpowers what littke ta flavor there is. The other thing I noticed is that it almost has a weird chemical taste to it. I had subscribed to this, but cancelled after first shipment.
If you really want a good strong flavored unsweetened tea, I highly recommend Lipton's  Pure Leaf unsweetened tea. It is the best out there. And Amazon has it!";negative
I ordered TWO cases of this because of all the high reviews and I just don't like the taste of this water.  It's not so bad when really, really cold, but I won't be buying this again.  I just can't figure out why there is SO many high reviews on this.  It baffles me!!  It was packed very well and I didn't find it hard to open a bottle at all like some of the reviewers said, but the taste is what turns me off.;negative
It tasted bad and made me nauseous. And I broke out really bad around my mouth. I asked a friend who sells herbalife and she said maybe I'm allergic to something in it. Waste of money. I used it maybe 4 or 5 times then threw it in the trash. Not worth the awful break out on my face. Total waste of money.;negative
I bought this and a blueberry syrup by Pioneer Valley to compare and definitely prefer the Pioneer Valley, which has a much stronger blueberry flavor. I was hoping I would prefer the Madhava since it's made with agave, but I could barely detect a blueberry taste. It's also pretty light in color, which is probably why it does not have much blueberry flavor.;negative
"I was really excited about ordering this set and thrilled when it came.  I have noticed something unexpected about the teas, however.  With the teas I have tried from this set I have noticed an unpleasant dry aftertaste.  Another taster noticed the same thing without my mentioning it.

I really like the glass tea pot.  It is very nice to watch the tea fill the glass orb with color and flavor.  Whether the flowers are beautiful or look more like sea urchins will be a matter of personal taste.

I had high hopes for the Starlight Rose Tea (white tea leaves with rosebud) and found it far inferior to Rose Petal Black Blended Tea by The Republic of Tea, which is excellent.  On the other hand, Numi's Moroccan Mint is one of the finest teas I have ever tasted, superior to an old favorite of mine- Stash Tea Moroccan Mint.

After tasting this tea I am surprised by the number of reviews rating the tea that comes with the set as quite good.  Maybe I got a bad batch or have strange taste buds- but there it is.

The bamboo box is quite charming.";negative
Love this water but HATE the plastic bottles. Gave off a chemical smell. I would not recommend ordering this again. just order the glass ones from someone else though. The seller was very difficult work with to return and would not replace unless I paid the return shipment which was more than I paid for product.;negative
Any one who wrote a good review of these has not had real Licorice all sorts.  These are mostly colored candy and a little licorice.  The pieces are weirdly large and not nearly as colorful as they appear as pictured.  I returned them!;negative
bought this stuff for a gift, because of a supposed expert reviewer's opinion. sigh. good thing i tried this before gifting, it is bad tasting, terrible. i did try one out of a sampler pack and it did taste better, at least less noxious anyway. made me think of 'bait and switch'. i did find the other high rated coffees tested to be quite fine. not this one, for me never, ever, never again.;negative
"OK it is gluten free and that is pretty much all I can say about it!  If you were making a big pot of chicken noodle soup to heat up for your family over several days I would consider it and here is why.  I was making a beef, celery, noodle dish.  I boiled the noodles as directed for 12 min. and they were still pretty much rock hard in the center.  So I boiled them for another 5 Min., now that is 17 min.  and guess what, they were still ""hard"", not firm but ""hard"".  Then I boiled them another 7 Min., now we are at about 23 min.  They never really softened to the point of simply slightly firm.  I will not order this product again, in my opinion ""simply thumbs down"".";negative

"first off, I was very disappointed how small the shrimp are. ""21/25"" apparently refers to the size/weight count of the shrimp AFTER breading, and not the shrimp themselves (which are ridiculously tiny, no bigger than 51/60 or maybe 41/50 if you are being kind or hopeful)

so next, obviously, that means there is a ton of breading. which makes it difficult to get the shrimp inside cooked, the middle breading not-soggy, and the outside not-burned, all at the same time. and even when cooked close to properly, the breading still was not that appetizing.

but the worst had to be the flavor of the shrimp itself - they are peeled and deveined, but somehow every single shrimp, tasted overpoweringly of ""vein"". just unpleasant.

will never buy again. the same company's 2# frozen 41/50 peel and eat, though, is more than good, it's great. get that instead.";negative
Never ordered!!;negative
I was excited about getting this, and it did come in a timely manner, however I disagree with many of the reviewers who think this is a potent flavoring.  It is very mild and hardly worth the expense to me.  I liked that it is Stevia, because my husband is diabetic, but he was not thrilled with the strength of the flavor.  It is too expensive to add enough flavor to make it taste good.  It does smell good.  We decided to try pure extracts, which don't have sugar added, so we bought Watkins lemon and orange pure extracts.  They taste great and have no sugar.  I believe they will prove to be much less expensive too.;negative
Claimed no sugar added. Has sugar.;negative
Didn't like it.;negative
Runny and bitter, with an odor lacking in many of the appealing qualities of good honey. Hard to believe it's not watered down.  Also hard to believe that most of the good reviews for this are legit because the product does not support it.;negative
the ravioli was delivered frozen and it was fresh, but there wasn't really any chicken in it!  ive had other brands with more chicken in them. and i didn't taste the sweet pepper. it was plain tasting. i was expecting more of a sweet pepper taste and chicken.;negative
I'm not sure where to begin here...  I think it's gross.  just all around, gross.  The regular coffee tastes so watered down, the flavored coffees were sickening,(like vanilla that tasted like they dumped imitation vanilla in it).  The bold is the only flavor I could handle.  It was pretty strong, so I just added water to it, and then it was drinkable.;negative
Plain are delicious but all the flavors are horrendous. They taste like...Hmmm...chemicals? I would think there aren't chemicals in them but it doesn't matter because the HOUR LONG AFTER TASTE IS SOOOO BAD and so much like non-food flavor. I bought this because the plain I ordered were so delicious but gave them away because only the plain is edible.;negative
Stale !!! WOW !;negative
"Seriously disappointed 
I was a manager at Dunkin Donuts many years ago, and we had this flavored syrup that was so good. It was strong.

Three pumps of this in an extra large tastes like nothing. Was expecting a bit stronger. Won't be buying this brand again ";negative
"I was very disappointed in this coconut water. Not that it didn't taste good, it does. BUT THAT IS BECAUSE IT IS FULL OF ADDED SUGAR! As much as soda. What is the point of getting ""pure"" coconut water, when they dump a bunch of sugar in it before it even ships! For the cost, this is not for me. I won't pay this much for sugar water.";negative
didn't like to dark and fishy;negative

Awful.  Mostly unpleasantly flavored yellow gooey gravy-like substance with small bits of chicken (flavorless), and bits of what appears to be vegetables.  Threw it away after a couple small bites.  Will never order again.;negative
"This tastes terrible. It's nothing like real frosting. The texture is weird. The flavor is weird. To those who say it is ""too sweet,"" I don't think you've ever tasted real frosting. Real frosting is not a nutritious food, but neither is this. At least real frosting is yummy. My suggestion: Use real frosting or forego it completely. It's not worth this. Even if you're diabetic. Horrible.";negative
I bought the six pack case and after baking the first two boxes I am confident that I won't be purchasing this again. If you are looking for chocolate decadence, you won't find it here. The next box I will try with regular oil not melted butter/margarine as directed. Maybe then I'll get that chewy, gooey richness that this products claims. There is a strange aftertaste, not one that I wish to linger. Betty Crocker G/F brownie mix is by far a better tasting brownie and less expensive. My vote is G/F with Betty C!;negative
Such a disappointment!!;negative

I have purchased this blend before and loved the bold richness of this coffee.  This purchase is a total disappointment.  It is very weak, no matter how many more tablespoons I add.

"I have ordered from this company before and found that their tea bags did not have staples, so I ordered a pack of 6 boxes of their tea only this time in Peppermint. The sad thing is while some companys do the right thing with high quality products I have found other take short cuts and it seems this company has by using staples to attach the string to the tea bag which is HIGHLY poisonous. The product I have tried in the past did not have staples I guess they thought we would not notice.
PLEASE BE AWARE if you are drinking hot tea with a staple attaching the string you are are taking in toxic substance while you think you are doing good things with the tea. I know for sure two teas and a bud do not use staples so I will stick with them";negative
Smashed by gallon water and cans. Still eatable but i shouldnt have to eat smashed bread when i pay hard earned money for good bread bagels cinabon bread . Either the people packing don't care or need more training. Im usually so satis fied but this time so disappointed.;negative
I expected these to taste like real cheese after reading some of the positive reviews, but they taste like a cheese powder mixed with other stuff and they look like mini rice cakes.  I am really disappointed in the flavor of these and won't be purchasing them again.;negative
"I have an excellent sense of taste, unfortunately, and these tasted more like chocolate than pecan.  I like chocolate, but not in my pecan
pie.  I also got the sense that they were getting stale as even the gelatin sugary filler had very little flavor.  I have had many  mini pecan pies
before and these had to be the poorest tasting ones ever.  If I am going to consume a bunch of calories I at least want them to taste good.
Some of them had damaged crusts, but that is to be expected from normal shipping trauma.  I did not count off for that, but the low grade
is strictly due to the inferior flavor.";negative
These were more chocolate tasting than coconut tasting. The chocolate over powered the coconut so you could not taste the combination of chocolate and coconut. Disappointing I would not buy again. Had to give the one I purchased away because I could not eat them because I did not like them.;negative
found that it's not low acid;negative
You Get What You Pay For!!!!;negative
The chocolate arrived on time but it had gone bad. It was supposed to be dark chocolate but it was discolored and we were afraid to even try it.  It came from overseas so were wondering if the temperature changes on the journey caused the issue.;negative
"Bought these truffles as a three pack. One for my own family and two as part of my children's godparents gifts for Christmas. I live in MN so I thought I would be okay to order them in early December when our temps are below freezing. (Other reviewers claimed that they received melted candy, but I thought I would be safe.) Unfortunately that was not the case. I could tell that something was wrong right away. When I opened the box that I purchased for my family I was disappointed to find a large lump of melted truffles. Because they are not individually wrapped, they all just melted together. I didn't want to give these away as gifts so I opened up the second box, which actually sounded like perhaps they might be okay, it at least sounded like it hadn't all melted together when I shook the box. The second box, oddly enough was not melted. (This was a three pack, so you would have thought that if one was melted then they all would be) However, all the cocoa powder that should have been coating the truffles had fallen off and settled in the bag. What was left was small uneven chocolate rounds that resembled presents that my dog leaves on my sidewalk when he is mad at us. Not fit for gifting, not even appetizing enough to put out of the counter at my house. Because I HATE wasting I ended up grinding up the ""lump"" that came in the first box to use for baking. I rolled the naked truffles in baking cocoa to try and vamp up their appearance in hopes that they would get eaten.  The third box is sitting in the bottom of my pantry unopened. Very disappointed. The ones that I vamped up, we finished off about 1/3 before we got sick of eating them. They are okay, but not really something that anyone got to excited about. I would never purchase these again.";negative
My initial review of this product was glowing, but continuing to use it I have found the product quality to be most inconsistent:  Sometimes the coffee is great then the next cup will be like dishwater.  I'm an analyst by profession but I cannot figure this one out.  Until Melitta can correct the inconsistency in this product, I will not purchase it again.  I'm cancelling my subscription.  Original review:  Recently I have been very disappointed with my Senseo coffee pods which I have been buying for several years. The flavor had become so weakened that I was adding other instant coffee to it to try to produce a robust cup of coffee.  I had even considered replacing my coffee maker. When the Senseo pods were no longer available, I decided, reluctantly, to try these Melita pods as they were more reasonably priced than the other alternatives.  What a pleasant surprise!!  Here's my robust coffee back again!! These pods definitely have more coffee in them because, when I discard them, they are noticeably heavier than were the Senseo pods.  Also, I had to use the larger pod holder that came with my machine because, when wet, the smaller holder would not contain the coffee while brewing.  Another pleasant surprise... these pods are individually wrapped and come in a dispenser box!  Try the subscription (you can select your own delivery interval) and save about $1 per box and get free shipping!  Thank you, Melita and please don't change this product in any way or you will be hearing from me for sure.;negative
I was so excited to find a pasta that was only 5 carbs.  However after I received them and read there is actually 40+ carbs, I did some research.  Nobody can say why there is only 5 digestible carbs.  My family is doing a low carb diet and I am diabetic.  I spike the same as with normal pasta and have actually put on some weight after adding this in a few weeks ago 2x a week.  Feel lied to.  Now I have a stock pile of pasta that can't be used.  Do your own research before buying....  Not worth the risk of blowing your diet...;negative
"I bought this salt years ago, and liked it - so was happy to buy the three-pack here on Amazon.  This time - must have been a bad batch.  The salt is terribly gritty - almost like tiny pieces of sand or glass.

I am throwing the rest of it out.";negative
Im really disappointed... I had hoped this would be just as good as their sugar free cherry syrup, but its just weird. Not at all syrupy, it is a clear liquid - almost like the product was watered down, yet it was sealed.;negative
I just did not like it!!;negative
"Sweet, sticky (too moist) and compared to dried prunes purchased from local health food stores or whole foods these are really almost tasteless in comparison. This isn't my conclusion from one batch of 6, but I've purchased this a number of times, but giving up and never going to again.,

Due to the excess moistness, the prunes usually end up as a clumped up gooey mess.

The packaging is only convenient if you intend to remove all contents at the time of opening, as a storage medium to eat casually it falls short.

At first really liked these, but quality of the final product has really gone down hill.

Kind of like the organic raisins whose quality slipped. Last time I got the raisins each contained a hardened mass of raisins that appeared to have sat in a very hot room over the summer, or just baked for a while. Sent some back to Amazon, easy peezy, but on my next order it sure seemed like they sent the exact same ones back to me.

While at times Amazon's food products are good, it seems raw food or dried food products are not. Especially these Newman's Own dried fruits, it's just a shame.";negative
While this does take me down memory lane as a child growing up, there is one big difference.  Back when I was a kid, these caramels were soft. The ones I got here were hard and probably would pop off a filling if anyone actually chewed it. Also the flavors are not equally distributed. I got mostly orange favored.;negative
This is a new process for me. I think it dilutes the flavor significantly,  but it's the texture bothers me. They're dry and crunchy...just not a texture that I'm neither familiar with nor like. I'll eat almost anything with mango...but not these;negative
Way too expensive but real French green lentils are expensive and somewhat difficult to find here in the States. I did shop around and did not find any better price for du peu lentils .  I did not  particularly like the taste but a friend I shared with did like them. I would not buy this product again;negative
I was looking for a bread mix that produced a loaf with some character and texture This makes a fairly heavy loaf in my Zojirushi. If not eaten immediately I find it inedible. I don't think I will buy it again.;negative
Not nearly as good as Twizzlers. I bought these because I heard Alex Bennett raving about them one day. Must be a West Coast thing. The only thing that makes these better than Twizzlers is a simpler ingredients list.;negative
I really like the Dark Chocolate Nuts with sea salt, but the package arrived damaged. Kind bars from another seller were put into a protective inner box, not this one. the flap had torn off and was taped back into place!! Really.  The chocolate was melted.  I was not too sure that they would be good to eat. I will not buy them again from this seller.;negative
too sweet;negative
"Oh NO!!!!!!!!!!! when i ate the first flavor which is Texas BBQ, i was talking to myself, damn it, i hope other flavors could be better. and guess what, it turns out that the first one IS the best flavor.....

Be seriously, i was wondering will it be better if those jerky are not with any flavor, as a product make by soy, those are quite chewing.";negative
"The ingredient list suits my allergies, and I was really looking forward to this, since I am housebound from illness. But this has far more sugar than any granola I have ever bought, whether from a health shop or a supermarket. Granola was always a cereal for people who are interested in health. You have a right to expect a granola in this category to fall within the norm with regard to sweetness or say something on the label like (""extra sweet""). ""Sweet Home Farm"" does not qualify as fair warning.";negative
Taste is OK, but the six bags I received, although packed snugly in an outer carton, contained very few whole pieces. Just a bagload of tiny pieces the size of a thumbnail. In the first bag there were a total of eight intact pretzels!!! Out of probably about sixty!!!  Fortunately these are my personal snacks, was not planning to use to serve at a party. However, I will NEVER buy these again!!!!;negative
Did not like this brand.;negative
First, this comes in the equivalent of a produce dept. plastic bag.  It is taped shut, there is NO label that states where this comes from, nor what this product's ingredients are. The licorice is HARD, and not like the Australian licorice that comes in the white bags/packages.  We will NEVER buy this again.  This is VERY suspicious packaging.;negative
Hate, a pretty strong word. I don't hate this product, however when I received my creamers no one took in mind the altitude of where I live. Over 40 of the creamers had self-destructed making a complete mess of all the other little puffed up containers. At first I tried to separate the good from the bad. Twenty minutes into the process I gave up. This is going to sound weird, but the containers which were leaking I poured into my dogs dish. This dog eats everything. She walked over, put here nose to the bowl, gave me the evil, and walked away. Yep, I won't be doing this again any time soon.;negative
Too salty!!!!!;negative
I rarely if ever give below 4 or 5 stars on most things I review, and that is because I research everything as much as possible before purchasing. Also, before I write a review that is less than 3 or 4 stars, I usually contact the seller. Unfortunately this product was purchased and sold through Amazon, and Braga Farms was nowhere to be found to write to on here. The seeds taste delicious. However, there is way, Way, WAY, TOO MUCH SALT in terms of the taste! However, it appears that so many people rated these very highly, so perhaps most other people do not agree with me. Yet, before I wrote this review, after I could not find where to write to Braga Farms, I looked to see if I was the only person thinking this, and ironically, the first review I saw before further researching it, was from 2014 claiming there is too much salt. To be fair though, it did get saltier as I got down to the last third of the bag. If Braga Farms is willing to contact me, and either tell me I got an unusal batch, or that I was supposed to shake it each time I ate some, or something else I had not yet thought of, I would consider updating this review, especially if I have a chance to have a bag that is not so salty. On second thought, even shaking the bag may not be right for me, because I liked how it was tasting at first. Again, many people rated these highly so please don't only go by my one experience. I want people, including Braga Farms, to have thriving businesses if they are selling vegan products that are healthy.;negative
Very good but I ordered pumpkins and they had apparently melted and I had peanutbutter globs.  I feel this was Amazons fault not Reese's.  Very disappointed as I was going to use them as decoration on a dessert.;negative
"I'm sorry I couldn't give this more stars; the company seems to have strong ethical values and is proud of their product, but I couldn't handle the taste of it. I received all four of the flavors, and chose my favorite, Mocha, to be the first I tried. I couldn't even finish the little cup...it was just terrible TO ME. And I know taste is relative, so others, I'm SURE, will like it; but it's not for me. I have the other cups away at work. No feedback yet from those. Maybe I should have heated it...I don't know if even that would hav made a difference.";negative
"The price is cheap for a reason. This is some of the toughest jerky that i've ever had, and I've been eating jerky for over 35 years. Too much dried fat to be able to pull the stuff apart with your teeth. Flavor was good on about 50% of the pieces. The others had little or none. I think this stuff would be much better suited as a dog treat for a small breed. For me, it's pretty awful.

I also got a bag of the peppered type. That review is pending.";negative
"These days all reputable food companies put a ""contains nuts"" warning on their label if it does.  Cashews is really embedded in the ingredients, and could be easily missed by someone.  I hope nobody serves this to a nut allergic child by accident.  At the very least they could put the nut ingredient in bold print.  Who would ever think that vegetable soup would contain nuts??";negative
"I purchased this because it sounded so good. We love the Donut House decaf (and my husband would not drink and decaf before we found this brand). I was hoping this would be as yummy as it sounds, even tho I had read many negative reviews. I am really not that picky. I love most coffee, especially flavored unless it is very ""fake"" tasting flavor. Save your money on this one. Unfortunately, this is pretty awful tasting, even after I tried to ""doctor"" it up with syrup and cream. The nicest thing I can say about it is it smells good while brewing.";negative
We used to be big fans of these chips, but they seem to have changed the recipe when they changed the packaging. We used to devour them by the bag, but this new recipe just doesn't taste right to us. Now they much, much saltier, with less cheesy-goodness. We're cancelling our subscribe & save order, since neither one of us actually wants to eat these anymore. On the plus side, we're no longer eating way too many chips!;negative
"This a shameful. pitiful, and fraudulent representation of ""Baklava"". The seller used the term ""small cut"", in the description. Even that is misleading. These things are TINY....smaller than bite-size..... and hard, dry and appear to be manufactured and not ""home-made"". THEY ARE AWFUL!!!";negative
item arrived damaged, plastic top was intact, but foil liner was damaged and about 1/3 of the product was missing.  Amazon credited my account promptly, but since it was a food item and arrived damaged and opened, I threw it out and therefore unable to rate the actual product.;negative
bitter as heck.  YUCK;negative
These boxes on first review appear to be a money saving buy when bundled in a 8 pk purchase, but in reality each box contains only .3 0z of contents which is only a half of the amount in a standard Jello retail. In reality the contents of 8 min-boxes reduces down to 4 standard, (.6 oz) packages and amount to twice the price per box over local retail outlets. This amounts to a devious trick over Amazon customers trust and is not worthy of Amazon's duplicity with these kinds of sales !;negative
"I came on here to give it 5 stars and order another set but..
I see they have massively increased the price! It is no longer a 5 star buy at the new price and I will not purchase again at this price. They have increased the price from $31 to $47. That is more than 50% increase!

I found this 96ct case for $33  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LX07YGE/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1";negative
returned..;negative
"I bought these specifically because this brand appreared in the Weight Watcher Power Foods list. I'd never heard of them, and they aren't available locally. I found these to be very pasty and gluey - they have a very unappetizing texture. There really isn't any flavor, either.
I split this order with a friend (who shared my opinion of them) and am happy I did - even 2 cannisters will be hard to get through.";negative
Taste terrible, I hate it.;negative
"These are nasty. I expected them to taste like banana chips, naturally sweetened with a ""banana"" taste - wouldn't you think that would make sense? They honestly taste like concrete. No flavor or sweetness whatsoever. I had to throw the bag away and could barely swallow just one! I am used to eating healthy/ clean foods, but these are just gross. On the bright side, the package did come very quick, when ordered with Amazon Prime.";negative
"Love Harney & Sons. I've been so pleased with all that I've tried. This Royal Palace tea is a mystery, however. The top of the tin had a secondary label slapped on that covered another label which stated, ""Sold as a Set."" A set with what? I was so looking forward to citrus flavors of lemon and grapefruit. Instead, I found the tea to smell like a stale Earl Grey. The flavor wasn't very pleasant, either. The tin certainly contained the pyramidal sachets with Harney & Sons tags, but nothing additional that would confirm the contents/ingredients.  Did this perhaps come from a re-seller?";negative
I expected these to be crispy and tasty like others I have tried.  This had no taste, smelled funny and was a super spongy/odd texture.  After eating some, I ended up with a stomach ache.  I threw the bag away after that.  Waste of money.;negative
I hate it because it is a nestle product and I now boycott all nestle products until and unless nestles CEO either apologizes for his statement regarding that water should NOT be free because it is  NOT a human right or he is fired or resigns;negative
Basically this flavor is only good in small doses.  Make a smaller cup, then drown it in milk with a touch of sweetener, and then its good.  Heaven forbid you combine this with a minty (Girl Scout Cookies flavored Thin Mint) coffee creamer, you'll literally hate it.  But with tons of milk its not half bad.;negative
Contains trans fat;negative
I have purchased other offerings from the company and enjoyed them all - except this one.  The beans were a mishmash of lightly roasted to dark roasted beans.  There was no consistency of flavor from one pot to another.  It could taste like dishwater with one pot and a rich cup on the next using the same grinding settings and water temperature.  I am going back to the Haitian Blue - which provides a medium roast with great aroma and flavor.;negative
"The taste is very good, but the arrival condition is a  1*.  As you can see from the attached photo, this is how I received all my orders. Good cracker crumbs, or soup/chili toppings, but to accompany a holiday cheese tray, they just don't ""cut the mustard"".  If you never expect these crackers to arrive in a cracker form, then buy them; but I want a cracker I can serve to guests.";negative
"I have been drinking coffee for a few years now.  This coffee is not very good tasting or very good quality.  I purchased this to replace the same type of coffee that you can by at Starbucks, but this is clearly fair inferior in quality and taste.  This leads to the age old adage that ""you get what you pay for.""

Mind you, this coffee is not disgusting.  I would equate it to the off brand pre ground coffees you can by in any box store in mass qualities.  I would say it taste like Office Coffee.";negative
There is a strange strong element to this soup's flavor I don't know if it's too much cilantro or sprouted garlic (taste similar), or an overdose of cumin or another spice/herb that I can't identify.  If you bought 12 of them as I did, add a can of Muir Glen tomatoes, another can of beans, some garlic, salt and some olive oil.  That makes use of it without too much fuss.;negative
"I am not a picky snacker (I try to eat only healthy/organic/whole foods snacks). But these taste just awful.  The salt needs to be increased greatly!  I am a low-salt eater (by choice), but even with that, these are just way too low on salt.  The flavoring is very one-dimensional - some more effort needs to be put into making the pizza flavoring have more depth, and character.

That said, twice I have ""binged"" on almost a whole bag (I am trying to finish them off!) and the following morning I have a 2 lb. weight loss.  Weird?  I normally do not eat late at night, but with these I did.  I don't understand it, but I like that there is some compensation for eating such an awful tasting (though somewhat healthy) snack.";negative
"The brownies taste okay (not stellar, just okay), but they do have leave a cooling sensation on the tongue after taking a bite, which it typical of erythritol sweetener. I don't care for that, but some don't mind. To each his/her own, but regardless, the cooling sensation is there. In addition, the brownies, while moist, are lacking the ""chewy"" factor that I've come to expect and want in a good brownie. I realize that, because they don't have gluten, the chewy factor is hard to create in a mix like this, but sadly, that takes a lot from the brownie for me. Ordinarily I would say these brownies would do in a pinch, but due to the price ($12 for a single package that makes a small 8X8 pan - ouch!) and the other factors I've listed, these truly fell short for me. I wanted them to be the missing brownie that I crave, but they weren't, and between me and my significant other, we ate half of the small pan that the mix made, and threw the rest out. Not worth the money in my view. My search continues.";negative
I make iced tea by the gallon using loose leaf teas. Every other brand I've tried has needed 20g of tea, but with Tattle, even 25g isn't enough and I can't fit any more in the #4 bags I use. I've had to supplement by adding 3 bags of my favorite Welsh tea to every pot just to get the flavor strong enough to be tolerable. That's disappointing and I won't be buying Tattle again;negative
Did not fit Keurig.;negative
"Someone at work swore by these and talked about how delicious the flavor was. So I thought I'd try them out. Yuk! I could not finish even one of these. I had a variety pack and it didn't matter the flavor...I didn't like any of them. Making them ""colder"" didn't improve the experience. Lucky for me, I had someone to gift these to -- the same gentlemen who told me about them. He still likes them...";negative
Umm was this suppose to be Himalayan or sea salt and the size :( its so pale, that majority of this is white ... last time I bought the cake s.o.s brand and it was awesome.... I would not recommend this ! Included pictures of what I currently use that I bought from amazon vs this. Buy this cake brand ... its like a buck more!!!;negative
Grainy;negative
Terrible. Poor quality, mainly sticks and old stale pieces. Little or no scent. Even found some insect webs on pieces. I picked through and found a few salvageable stars but will likely reorder from someplace else. I guess I should have read the reviews before I ordered;negative
This item really is awful. The eggs fried taste very bland and heavy and waxy. When used in baking, this item makes all my baked goods heavy and rubbery. I have thrown out anything I have put this egg substitute into.  I thought this was going to be the answer to my dreams, considering some of the reviews. I did use ice cold water as recommended. Otherwise, do not waste your money. This makes the baked goods have a real strong egg flavor also.;negative
there was absolutely NO coconut taste in this coffee. It did not smell like coconut, it smelled and tasted just like plain coffee. Not bad, but not what I expected or as advertised. I am a regular user of Folger's Gourmet Select coffees, so I expected it to be like the hazelnut and vanilla biscotti, plus other flavors I have used in the past. This was a huge disappointment. When I opened any of the other coffee flavors, ether was a distinct scent of whatever the flavor was supposed to be, the vanilla biscotti had a distinct vanilla scent and the hazelnut had the scent of hazelnuts. Both had the distinct tastes according to what was on the package. I do NOT recommend this product, flavor.;negative
I bought this for my husband as the only way he will drink water is with some additive stuff and he has been getting tired of drinking fruity ones like Mio so I bought him the iced tea to try . This stuff is only good while your drinking it, after you stop drinking it you get a nasty fake sugar after taste in your mouth. This is nothing like the Lipton ones you buy premade in the bottles or the powder that you mix with water. I won't be buying this again;negative
Absolutely horrible.  I had one in a bag of mine, and the powder managed to get over everything and then melt into a sticky mess.  Plus, it didn't reconstitute very well or taste very much like coconut water.;negative
I should have read the ingredients when I got this.  If you have an allergy to SOY,this isn't for you.  I got ready to make a ham gravy tonight and realized it has soybean oil....I had already given a jar to my son or I would have returned the case.;negative
I am really allergic to this SweetLeaf Stevia Sweetener, and have broken out with a rash, bumps, blisters, redness, bad itching, swelling, and now an irritated mouth and throat. Just realized today that this sweetener is causing all this. I was really enjoying this sweetener, and thought I had found a good healthy one.;negative
"Hard and dried out beef jerky.  I will be throwing it out as I can't even take the strips apart within the bag. Update:  My husband wouldn't let me toss the jerky. He didn't mind the ""toughness' of it, and ended up eating the entire bag.  I guess I prefer the softer, more chew-able kind.";negative
The two pound bag was clearly taken from a larger package and poorly shipped in a Ziploc bag with a sticker on the front. Not vacuum  sealed or even a tamper evident seal. And the nuts were stale. I roasted them for a while and got some flavor out of them but I'd never buy from this seller again.;negative
not very nutty;negative
Not good at all. Taste is not good.;negative
"Dissapointed. More than 1/2 the Pods were not airtight. I could tell because there was no bulge on the foil lining on top of the pod. The expiration date on the box was in the future, so this was a manufacturer error.
The coffee tasted thin and stale.  I'm going back to another brand.  Good bye Green Mountain.";negative
"Doesn't taste like Mocha...and its 60 calories unlike most other flavored coffees which are around 5 calories, its not horrible but I would definitely describe it as ""wasted calories"" since its underwhelming. Wont buy again.";negative
"I have heard this product is made by a company that is antisemitic and anti Israel. I will not buy it anymore. I received an email which explained:
Not So Kind Bars - A Product of Peaceworks
 Peaceworks, the anti-Israel 501(c)(3) that received State Department funding, supports the One Voice International movement and worked closely with V15 to defeat Netanyahu during the recent election in Israel, has just been awarded 501(c)(4) status. They have received favored status from our tax dept as they got a really fast and easy approval for tax exempt status.
Peaceworks exists to advance a negative view of Israel worldwide and to push for the creation of a Palestinian state forthwith.  Their new 501(c)(4) status will avoid future roadblocks to political activities in the future.  (I won't be surprised if Peaceworks is excused for interfering with Israeli elections on the fallacious basis of a PENDING 501(c)(4) application)!";negative
"First, the other reviews are correct that these have a fairly fast shelf life.  This sucks since I do not want to eat 12 in the span of a few weeks.  My guess this is due to one of the packets being ""mayonnaise mustard"" since the other ingredients are dry.

The taste is another thing.  I have enjoyed quite a few noodle bowls, and this combination is a bit rough.  The noodles are ramen style, and after you smear on the mayo/mustard, the whole bowl tastes pretty much like noodles in a spicy grey poupon.  Not the best flavor.  The vegetable packet is also minimal.  So, in the end, you have spicy noodles in mayo.

And, they are crazy expensive for what they are.";negative
Its very bland;negative
I was really excited to try this product. Unfortunately, the product is a huge disappointment. The bars are extremely hard and practically inedible for me. Normally I am happy with the Costco/Kirkland brand until this. Won't be buying the product again and not sure what to do with the remaining 18 bars. Guess they will make great paperweights.;negative
"I absolutely can not recommend this product.  It is only $5.97 at Wal-Mart yet they are selling it here for double.  As well, it is NOT vigin or ""natural"" at all. It is a refined, bleached and highly processed coconut oil.  BEWARE of this product if you are looking for quality.
Don't take my word for it - look up what the professionals have to say about it.";negative
"I used Xango years ago, and honestly, it was probably the best supplement I ever used. I had never felt a supplement working like that, in 20 years of using them. Problem was, it was so expensive. To use it 1 oz 3x a day, it's $140 a month after shipping.

Recently, I've been fortunate enough to be able to be in a financial position where I can easily afford this, so I bought a case. This Xango is NOT the same as it used to be. They either changed the formula, or skimped out on the active ingredients or something. OR, this Amazon stuff that I got is an imposter and not the real Xango.

This stuff is incredibly ineffective, and is no healthier than drinking 1 ounce of $3.99 POM juice a few times a day. Colossal waste of money. Don't do it.";negative

"Hard to rate higher a tasty soup when my purpose is to warn you that this is the second time this particular soup has arrived badly dented - so much so that it was dangerous to open.  One order had 10 of 12 cans unusable! The other order was from several months ago and had 4 of the 12 badly dented.  Sorry to say that we won't be ordering this again even tho' the price is so good compared to at the local foodstore. As always, Amazon came through with their promise to serve the customer fairly and well. They refunded the order with no hiccups! Thank you Amazon.

"I purchased *five pounds* of raspberries and blackberries because I've had Haribo gummi bears before and really enjoyed them, plus the price can't be beat (usually just five ounces is two to three dollars, imagine getting five whole pounds for fifteen dollars!).

I DID NOT ENJOY these.  Buy the gold gummi bears instead.
These raspberries blackberries are too sweet and have a weird consistency.
They are nothing like the Jelly Belly raspberries blackberries (which are lovely little drops of heaven).

I was very uncertain buying raspberries blackberries online, because I wasn't sure if I would get cruddy old stale raspberries blackberries that endanger your teeth and taste of old wax.

That was not the case with me.

These raspberries blackberries seem fresh, and were well packaged and delivered promptly.

I purchased the raspberries blackberries on Jan 27 2009.  I received them on Jan 30 2009.  They were fresh and squishy, and well packaged.  They shipped from Indianapolis and arrived in DC three days later.  Terrific.

Too bad you have to buy two bags to get free shipping, now I have 10 pounds of candy lying around!  Five pounds of which I really hate.

I would not recommend this product.  Go for the Haribo standard bearer, the gold gummi bear instead.";negative
Do NOT waste your money!! This is by far the worst GF flour I have tried! Pamela's and Mr. Ritt's has a much nicer consistency when baking and keeps pastry together. I am so disappointed that I wasted my money on this brand even after carefully reading teh other reviews.;negative
This is the best Jamaica Blue Mt. k cup out there.  I used to buy it in subscribe and save for @ $30.00 and that was high, but I was willing to pay for it every 3 months.  But $78.99 for 24 count is astronomical, and ridiculous for anyone to pay!  Hopefully,, Marley Talkin Blues will be able to work with Keurig for more reasonable prices.;negative
I used to like this coffee, but I have recently ordered this twice thinking the first box was either a fluke or bad batch.  Many of the pods do not work.  The coffee is very weak and watery.  I have salvaged the remaining that still work by changing the coffee cup midstream while brewing and discarding the remaining hot water still being dispensed giving me 1/2 the amount, but at least stronger tasting.  Will never order again;negative
Not if you don't need this;negative
"Pro: low calories
Con: I couldn't get past the watery consistency of this dressing.  Surprise surprise it's first ingredient is WATER.  I don't know ow a bout you but I don't believe in buying flavored water to autonomy salad.  Many people suggest this as a low calorie dressing.  Apparently they like it.  Taste and desire is subjective not objective.";negative
This is not sourdough bread, I had to double check the package to make sure they sent me the correct item because this is very sweet bread, there is nothing sour about it. It also taste like it is full of saw dust, the slices are extremely thin.;negative
NOT IMPRESSED.;negative
"Hey, their fruit and nut mixtures are great; but, this tastes like salted, stale cardboard left over from a 1974 commune kitchen.  Two points for being organic and non GMO.  But, find something else to buy.  You definitely won't enjoy this.....";negative
"Do believe the other reviewers, wish I did. Amazingly that I could possibly be writing a bad review for chocolate, but please be aware to only buy this if you love Whoppers, those gross little malted milk balls.

I would not complain if this had 25% of them, but most of the bag is whoppers more like 75% of them... I think this is left over whoppers from Halloween stock (because no one would buy them) so they dumped them all in a sack and unloaded them here on Amazon so you can not see the front panel (to see what you are getting)

Do not believe the photo... maybe 10 Reese's, 10 Hershey's, and 10 Kit Kat... DO NOT BUY !!!  Just not worth it, nobody will touch the Whoppers in my house, and if I am going to spend my calories on something, I am going to spend it on good chocolates... not chocolate wanna-be's.";negative
Gross tasting;negative
Products estimate of number of servings is grossly overstated. I tried this and found it took many more drops to give even small flavor. This might be an accurate estimate if you want jjust the faintest  whiff of smell in your water bottle.;negative
These pecans are advertised as halves, but what I received is a combination of halves, pieces, and dust.  The flavor is not consistent within the one bag...some are bitter, some stale, some excellent.  Overall, I do not recommend these pecans.;negative
"I have always been a candy cigarette lover when i saw o could get 3 cartons for 17.00 i knew i couldn't pass up the deal. Once u get over having to crack them because they are super hard then the chalky taste u loved finally kicks in. These are hard to break but the taste is still there if u can tolerate breaki g a tooth or loosing some just to get ro the great taste of the candy cigarette.
These must not be thr original company. My mom sent me some from NC and thise were perfect. I hope she can send me more because instill have an unopened carten and a half. Its taking me so long to eat them because rhey r super hard to bite and i don't want to crack a tooth. Definately don't want my kids eating it.
I guess this is a way to stop eating it and loose my acdition to them. Such a shame i love these things.. I hope my mom can find more in NC and send me these definately cant be same company even though the boxeslooks the same.
Maybe the ones i have are old being the reason they're super hard? I don't know..";negative
The tin is pretty, but the tea is a bit strange. Either the tea was slightly off (spoiled), or the genuine flavor is simply on the medicinal side (unlike the chamomile or lavender teas I've tasted before). I would have preferred a smaller tin and less tea, both of a higher quality, for this price. the tin is larger and more flimsy than I was hoping.;negative
Maybe I was hoping for too much. This was one of the worst things I have eaten in a long time. There was flavor but I couldn't tell u what it was and then the seeds get caught in your teeth. The rest are being tossed in trash tonight.;negative
"I would give the noodles four stars, because I have bought them from other vendors before. On this particular order, you are lucky to get a single star due to false advertising.

The product description said case of six. The packing list and contents for a single package of 1. I bought it in September of 2017 from Swanson Health Products.

As for the noodles, they smell fishy as they come out of the package wet, but following the instructions to rinse them well and then boil them and then dry them gets rid of all fishy flavor and odor and they are quite remarkable. It's just too bad they're so expensive.";negative
I do not like this period I will never buy again period I drank one can die my husband drink the other flavor and neither of us have had any since and that's been about a month ago period I will never buy again;negative
"After the first loaf never rose, i switched to the proven SAF yeast I use for other baking which never fails to rise.  Nothing.

Tried pure water, to avoid any chlorine issue.  Nothing.

Temperature is fine, no altitude issues, and other breads rise just fine.

Could be the manufacturer is using iodized salt which can significantly inhibit yeast, or preservatives.  Whatever the reason, the product is just a dense, rye brick.  Not a loaf of bread worth eating, so I ground it p for use as expensive bread crumbs.";negative
"I want to start off on a positive note in saying these drinks taste just like red bull (so A for taste).  I think maybe these power horse's are meant to be mixed with alcohol because alone they are by far the least effective energy drink out there.  I have drank 12 in a matter of a week but I am never was fully satisfied and drinking to much give me an upset acidic stomach.

I would order a test can or something before ordering large quantities like I did - they are good priced but they just don't do it like hansens/bluesky.";negative
Anything I made using this flour was a big disaster... I was very patient at first. I've tried multiple recipes and every time I had to throw everything to the garbage: cakes, bread, pancakes... I use only high quality and organic products so I wasted them too. Finally, I gave up and throw it out. Will never buy again.;negative
"I normally buy ""Just Poppin"" brand mushroom popcorn but to save some money and get free shipping I decided to try Hoosier Hill Gourmet Mushroom Popcorn. Ugh!!!!! It's NOT mushroom popcorn! It's butterfly popcorn like I can buy at the grocery store. I am very disappointed with this purchase. We had a Halloween party last night and had some leftover caramel popcorn(mushroom popcorn). I took a photo to show the difference. Sorry to be negative, but I'd hate for anyone else to waste their money. Thanks for reading this :)";negative
I've made my own cream of tomato soup for years, saw this online at a good price an thought what the hell I'll try it.  Big mistake it's overly sweet and very little tomato flavor, I even tried to doctor it up to make it edible, no chance I ended up taking 23 of the 24 cans I purchased to the local food shelter downtown.  Do yourself a favor and find yourself a good recipe. Will never ever buy Campbell's cream of tomato soup again.;negative
"Their coffee is a notch or two better than the average pod product so I went for the tea as well.  Bad choice.  An acrid brew that no amount of sugar, milk, or lemon can render palatable, much less cover.  Don't even dream of trying it straight.

Who knows, maybe its me but this brew is the pits.";negative
My milk was EXPIRED when I received it. I received it on 10.24.2013 and the expiration date on it is 10.20.2013!!! I really needed this and was counting on this. I've had to scramble to replace it. Thank goodness for the local Albertsons, who carried it for CHEAPER!;negative
too greasy;negative
"Not so impressed. How do you use this?  Too chipped. Sure it is healthy but it is minced too fine to work with unless you use a spoon to add.

Made some keto coconut macaroons with it and it was just aw right.

Just can't get the flavor in such a chipped product.
Almond flour is pretty good...";negative
No results noticed but made my cycles much shorter. I have used it on and off for awhile since getting it but am stopping now. I'll hold on to it for a time when I am closer to menopause and have cycles that are getting to long maybe.;negative
I was hoping to use this to sweeten home-brewed green and white teas, but there just wasn't much flavor or much sweetening. I'm keeping it to try over Greek yogurt as a dessert and hoping it will fit better there.;negative
Very disappointed in this.  Was looking for something that would provide a rich, creamy flavor.  This is not it.  It's so thin that it barely colors the coffee.  It does soften the flavor somewhat but not enough for me.  Will not order again.  Still searching for a non-dairy unsweetened coffee creamer.;negative
OK but not great. The majority of what is in the mix is pretty bland and flavorless. If you have a problem with spice and seasoning, you might want to try this. If you are looking for bold and spicy, avoid this.;negative
"It takes alot of this to TASTE it in tea or in food.  If you put it right on TOP of the food and don't mix it in then you can taste more of it.  Also, look up Agave Plant online.  You will find it high in oxalate acid and well, ""the juice"" of this plant on my hands did leave me with contact dermatitis.  The other problem was the oxalate level.  I happen to have to watch mine, and this is too high because the amount you have to use is well, alot to really get a sweet taste/as sweet as sugar.  Right, it doesn't raise blood sugar - but considering there is no real nutritional benefit this is one dietary ""extra"" I'm passing up.  I'm not diabetic so I can't speak for that situation, but I suppose if you were diabetic without a weightproblem (this is not low calorie) and no oxalate issues (kidney stone), then you might consider this product.  If not diabetic, don't bother.  Too pricey when a teasp of sugar is only 16 calories and sweetens much more easily.";negative
I bought this coffee based on the overwhelming number of positive reviews. Unfortunately, I was not impressed. We have so much unavoidable mediocrity in our life that I strongly believe that at least coffee needs to have strong personality. True espresso always brings to mind relaxing coffee drinking and people watching on Piazza Navona in Rome.  This coffee is not espresso by any stretch of imagination and I am ruling this mediocre creating out of my life.;negative
Mediocre. I was hoping for something I could put in my coffee that was pumpkin-flavored but didn't have a lot of calories. While the product is calorie-free, it's also taste-poor. If you use the suggested amount, your coffee is unbearably sweet. If I cut the amount in half, it improved but had very little pumpkin flavor. I threw the rest away. I'm off to Starbucks.;negative
My favorite brand  isn't available just now, so I'm looking for a substitute.  This might be the greatest to some, but it just doesn't do it for me.  There is nothing wrong with the coffee.  I won't be buying it again.;negative
This is a staple in our house so when our local grocery store ran out I thought we'd order it here. The best part of this granola is the chocolate that you bite into in chunks, but today it arrived and the granola was warm and the chocolate was completely melted! I was at home when it was delivered. If you aren't going to place any type of cooling pack in the box, you shouldn't be shipping this product in the summer. Just don't sell it in summer months. Not happy. I now have four bags of poor quality granola.;negative
"Disappointed, these are basically flavorless carbonated water with some caffeine. Wish I'd researched the reviews more closely before ordering. The ""flavor"" is more like an essence, very hard to detect, and to me not at all enjoyable. I'm looking for a healthy energy drink that isn't too sweet or overpowering in flavor, but the pendulum swung all the way to the left on this one. Probably an excellent product if you really like sparkling water!";negative
"I was very disappointed by the flavor.... or lack thereof.  If there was any significant flavor it wasn't good and certainly NOT like movie theater popcorn taste.  Using lots of extra squirts gave it more flavor but I may as well use butter or spray-on-butter at that point.
Additionally it was darned expensive, even more-so after you use 1/4 of a can to flavor a bowl of popcorn!";negative
Though the candy is terrific, the first roll I've opened is in pieces!  I have to shake the pieces out into my hand and then awkwardly try to get the pieces in my mouth!  I'm HOPING that only one roll is like that!  There doesn't seem to be any damage to the package, so I have no idea how the candy ended up this way;negative
"We live on sun butter.  We eat it daily but recently it has changed and become hard.  The product actually cracks and pulls away from the sides of the jar as a whole blob.  It is not possible to spread it without pulverizing the bread.  I am very sad that I will have to find another product.  I am looking to move to Trader Joe's Sunflower see butter.  I have contacted the company and I get no reply from them so I cannot continue to purchase this product.

I had already received another box of sunbutter after I wrote this.  It turns out they fixed the problem and the butter is creamy again!  I am so glad! I love this stuff and eat it everyday.";negative
The Gummi Bears arrived as scheduled and I opened the package to distribute into sealed containers for freshness preservation, but I probably shouldn't have bothered as they were already stale and hardened.  I will be finding another source for Gummi Bears after this waste of money.;negative
Horrible. They taste awful!;negative
"Having been extremely happy with their onion granules I decided to switch from Badia's peppercorn blend to this one.  I was pretty excited to top off my mill with this new blend until I opened the bag... what I found was total disappointment.  This ""blend"" consists of about 80% black, 19.7% white, 0.000000% red, and I believe I saw 1/4 of a single green guy in there. NOTHING like the picture.  I'll use it, but never order it again. The Badia costs more, but the blend is really tasty. Four blend that is- the five blend contains a LOT of coriander, which is obviously just a cheap filler. I really wanted to love this since the onion's so tasty, but now I'm a bit leery of trying their other products.  I hate giving a bad review but this simply does not live up to the description.";negative
"I wanted to like these. The price was great . The coffee just did not have much flavor. I like a bold brew and even the bold was mild ""breakfast blend"" or less intense even. My daughter tried the maple and said that one was really good.";negative
I got the pork beef jerky and it was great.  It didn't have toxic additives, like soy and monosodium glutimate and corn.  This package had those additives. and in addition, it wasn't very good tasting.  Very dry.  The additives kept me awake all night after I ate some.  It might be okay to people not sensitive to the additives, but not for me.  I threw it all away.  Waste of money.  When will food makers learn we don't want soy and monosodium glutimate additives in our food or our bodies?;negative
"Awful.  I remembered eating this when I was a kid and thought, wouldn't it be nice to relive those days.  Now I'm starting to wonder what other poison did my parents feed me during those days.

Taste absolutely awful and makes you thirsty afterwards.  A real bad sign because that can only mean harmful additives like MSG.

Unfortunately for me, I bought 2 cases of it.  My choice is throw it all out or eat it up and live a few days less.  I'm still deciding.";negative
I know you're supposed to be able to add this to meal shakes, but it has a strong taste that overpowers the shake.  I bought maca extract and really like the results from taking it.  Feel much better able to handle stress in a positive manner.;negative
Very bad!;negative
"These products are shipped FROZEN. From the warehouse. Amazon confirmed it. Frozen chicken does not normally taste half as good as fresh chicken.

Finally got an answer from AMAZON that was the TRUTH. Probably frozen once maybe twice before you cook them or perhaps freeze them again. Now you understand why some of you are getting frozen chickens delivered or why at least the flavor is off.";negative
"I purchased the Brazil Nuts for a friend; THEY ARE STALE!!!  I can't return them because I took them out of the original bag to put them in a plastic gift bag.  This is the first order of raw Brazil Nuts I received from Sincerely Nuts that were stale.  I am very disappointed because in the same order I ordered a 3 lb bag of raw shelled Walnuts which were terrible.  Sincerely Nuts has lost a repeat customer!!  Shame on Sincerely Nuts!";negative
Im sorry tot say but I do think they place sugar in this so called honey. I bought this in feb of this year and use a little at a time until I got to the bottom. The honey was so thick that I placed it upside down and it still wouldn't move. I even placed it in a heated room and still the honey stood at the bottom and wouldn't move. So I got a spoon and took some out and it was all paste. Like sugar paste like I can spread on bread. I tasted this and it tasted like pure sugar with a hint of honey. So sorry Im not buying this anymore;negative
These are awful. I tried every one of them, and blech! They taste just like what they are. Powders that are trying to be something they are not. I tossed them all .Serves me right for looking for a short cut. I don't recommend these at all, but for Pete's sake, avoid the Cheddar Bacon !!!;negative
I am unsure where to even begin.. the container is glass but the product arrived wrapped in one thin line of cheap bubble wrap inside a flexible Amazon Prime envelope. Im sure you can already see where this is going... yep, so I opened up the envelope and the jar was broken with peanut butter everywhere. I was surprised that there was no seal in between the peanut butter and the lid to preserve it. But of course that is irrelevant as it was already open... Despite it sitting in the sun for hours in 90 degree heat on my porch, I of course was going to taste it. I mean I DID just spend basically two hours of minimum wage employment hours on peanut butter. I didn't taste any pumpkin and was surprised that there is in fact no pumpkin in this pumpkin peanut butter. I tasted some spices but they did not seem to complement each other.;negative
"I was very disappointed to hear that this company is not only no longer owned by its co-founder David Wolfe, but they actually actively ripped the man off in a heinous, vicious manner.  A lot of people have only heard of goji berries thanks to Wolfe's tireless efforts in letting people know its value.  Sun Foods was taken over in a hostile bid that wrecked his life.

As far as taste, I got much better goji berries from Ron Teaguarden's Dragon Herbs at I Herb dot com (first time buyers also get a very sizable discount on orders).  The Sun food goji berries had some duds, the Dragon Herbs ones are much better in quality and taste which means they'll provide you the health benefits you're looking for as well.

A lot of people trying to eat better want to do it with integrity.  For anyone who wants to hear the sad tale of the Sun Foods saga and the nasty things going on as a few very low integrity mega corporations try to take over the natural foods market, I'm posting a link below to the Youtube.  I was surprised to hear this and would NEVER want to promote a company like this who stole a man's life's work out from under him.

Miso flavored water with other items that look like garbage. You look at picture on package and look at what is in your bowl and the two are not even long lost cousins. You have things floating in water that look exactly like bark off of a tree and parts of dirt. Nothing resembling tofu can be found.  Would not even recommend if there was an apocalypse on earth and this was the last food found.;negative
Not for me. Taste is artificial.;negative
Smelled like pain thinner.  I poured both bottles down the sink.  Gross and ruined the flavor of baked goods.  I am a very seasoned baker and could not use this stuff.  It was not remotely like any vanilla I have ever tried.  Just disgusting.;negative
looks like dog food;negative
Purchased once and LOVED the flavour, moisture and texture! Purchased a second time and was disappointed. Our second order was dry, darker and chewy. Figuring this was just a bad batch, we tried a third time and found the same dry, chewy texture and lackluster tasting disappointing product.;negative
"This was unusable on arrival.  Black mold on inside of packing.  I have purchased this item in the supermarket
And it is quite good and my toddler liked them.  I don't know what is going on here.  I did request a refund and it was granted.";negative
I thought some reviews were exaggerating, but ya don't buy these what so ever, because when you open them, the black ink or whatever is used for the text, falls off, and will fall onto the candy, you will be ingesting toxins, so this is a toxic product, do not purchase, buy the big bags on subscribe and save or food pantry, better buy and saves alot of money.;negative
"I don't know what this stuff is- but I am quite certain it is not 100% pure Kona coffee. I have been buying pure Kona since every year since 1998, and to date this is the third brand-but this is not Kona coffee. And frankly, I am ticked off to have wasted both my time and money! It came in such expensive wrapping. All dressed up and a bunch of regular coffee beans. Never again! Don't be fooled; this is not what it boasts it is!!!";negative
Love the product but will purchase from Publix in future for less than half this price. Was not expecting $7.00 order would only be one bag of chips. Read a review that indicated order was 6 bags! Should have clarified before ordering.;negative
"I had bought this thinking it would be tastier than powdered coffee creamer but it never fully dissolved. Perhaps it isn't meant to be stirred into hot liquid while in powder form. I used powdered coffee and just added a spoonful of this peak milk to the powder then poured the water over both. but no matter how much i stirred - the powder just swirled in dots in my coffee. Like when you accidentally use sour milk (but this stuff isn't expired and doesn't smell bad).

I didn't expect such a small can but now I'm glad it is so there's less to waste. I'm going to try making it up with cold water then adding it to coffee.

This isn't a product I'll buy again as I'm not a milk drinker, and if it's going to be this difficult to cream my coffee with it - it's not worth it.";negative
"It just didn't work for me. Since going Whole 30/Paleo I've had no trouble living without sugar. But, in my coffee I really miss the creaminess of dairy creamer. This product fell short in that category. In fact it just changed the flavor note of my coffee in a weird way. I've just decided to drink my coffee black. This product may work for others but it just made my coffee taste ""off"".";negative
Whts the point beyond taste;negative
Erythritol has snuck into this formula since I last looked at the label.  It used to be just stevia, a much better choice that the ultra-processed sugar alcohol erythritol, derived from cornstarch, that causes problems for many people including me.;negative
The taste wasn't bad at all but the seller should have stated that they were selling dented cans.  Some were so dented I had to throw them away.  There was not one can that didn't have a dent in it so I don't think this can be blamed on poor handling of shipping.  I will be very cautious about ordering canned goods from Amazon.;negative
Tasted like artificial sweetener;negative
"Ugh.  I really wanted to like this, but it just tastes weird.  It's incredibly sweet (yes, yes, I see the word ""sweet"" in it's name), much too sweet for me.  I am a fan of other Celestial Seasonings offerings, but this is a miss.";negative
I assumed this was oil made from truffles, but it's not.  It's olive oil FLAVORED with truffles.  It said it had truffles in it.  There was a single teensy weensy piece of truffle in it.  I'm not sure if I made the wrong choice or if they're all that way.  Nevertheless paying $15 for an eye dropper full of olive oil seems excessive.;negative
"Unimpressed with the clash of the too-minerally water taste combined with the grapefruit scent.  These drinks, as far as I can tell, are NOT ""flavored"" - they're ""scented"", which is exactly what I expected, only, I didn't expect the too-minerally taste to still be so overwhelming.  Maybe the canned version would be better?  Maybe watermelon or strawberry would be better?  I dunno, but I'm not going to be buying this version again.";negative
Hard and dry;negative
"I'm just trying to eat a bit healthier and eliminating wheat from my diet as much as possible.  I thought I'd give this a try instead of purchasing several ingredients to make my own ""special gluten-free"" flour.  Very disappointed.  I was expecting pizza crust that would taste ALMOST like the real thing.  Just not worth the hassle of baking 7 - 9 minutes - THEN putting toppings on and baking another 15 - 18 mins.

I guess I will just get Digornio Crisply Flatbread Tuscan Chicken pizzas once in a while.  They are much, much lower in carbs and take about 16 - 17 mins to bake AND taste great.

I would not buy this again - I have 3 unopened bags that I would sell if I was able to sell a partial box on Amazon.";negative
I used to love the Primal Kitchen-Avocado Oil Mayo, but I got this two jars and the mayo had separated, I had told this several years ago and the Primal folks would not ship in cold weathers. I did, and they did. I'm not upset, but I ask is that I mix or beat the mayo real well, so would that be just fine and have a good taste that I am used to, as I used to be. Thank you.;negative
"I regularly order dates, and I've never EVER gotten a batch from any company as bad as these.  They don't taste terrible--they're moist and my worst complaint there is that they are pretty smooshed and therefore unusually messy to eat--but they are FILLED with pits, and even worse, pieces of pits.  Sometimes very tiny pieces.  It's like eating chowder and constantly discovering shells, or finding bones constantly in every bite of chicken pot pie.  It's actually hard to not break teeth or accidentally swallow pieces, and giving them to my 1-year-old, who usually enjoys sharing dates with me, is downright hazardous.  We're not talking about one pit in the whole bag; I've eaten maybe 5% of the bag and have a nice pile of about 20-30 pit pieces (multiple per date) to show for it.  These are awful.";negative
I read some of the bad reviews but because it had 4 stars, I decided to ignore them and give it a try. I find this product disgusting. It's like the powder doesn't dissolve in the liquid and I own a high performance blender. The taste is not any better than the consistency, put sand with water in a blender and you would not tell the difference. I give it 1 star because I can't find a lower rating. I would throw it down my sink or toilet but it would clog it for sure.;negative
ordered 2 The packages came in a box without any gel packs or bubble wrap to keep them cold/cool or from moving around in a box that could have been smaller, they looked like they were just put in the box with one turned upside down with no stamps on the box to show this side up or fragile. the packs felt room temp so we placed them in the fridge to cool/cold for 2 hours and when we tried to  open one up it was one big block of peanut butter, chocolate and yes wrapper filled mess, so went to Amazon.com to get a return/ replacement but this is not eligible for return so I guess it's my mess to deal with, so no more orders from Amazon that has to do with candy or anything else that can't be returned. If they were just for me I would have still been upset but I gave them to my sister and niece when they came in so I was embarrast too;negative
"A little too sweet for us. However we had no problem swapping it to a friend for some coffee we enjoyed much more. She actually loves the Mocha blend and drinks it frequently.

Delivery was exceptional as always. Cannot think of a single fault of ""Prime Membership"".. Thanks Amazon.!!";negative
As described on time. Broken.;negative
There is nothing wrong with the way this product tastes, but it is difficult to cook with. I searched recipes on the internet and realized that in order to get recipes specific to this product, you have to buy the book. I tried other recipes that called for almond flour, but nothing turned out right in terms of consistency, although usually the taste was okay. Such failed experiments included cookies, pancakes, and biscuits. They just do not hold together no matter the variety of ways I tried to prepare them based on other cooks recommendations. I even tried a free biscuit recipe from the book's authors (specific to this product) and they also fell apart. Perhaps there are other uses for this flour than baking, but I haven't figured out what to do with what is left. If you are a skilled cook you probably will be fine using this almond flour, but if you are a novice or just adequate in the kitchen, as I am, I would not recommend this product.;negative
"I know what dry roasted tastes like, and maybe this was a bad batch, but you could smell and taste the burnt flavor.  A lot of the beans were literally black and there was quite a bit of blackened flakes floating around in the container.  Quite astonished at the high rating that other reviewers are giving this product.  I am not a picky eater when it comes to snack foods, but after trying a few different beans from within the container (hoping I just had a bad handful), they were all the same, just a hard, burnt/charcoal flavor and smell.  I have to assume it's a quality control issue since others have rated it so highly but I definitely will not be ordering again though.  I'd give it zero stars if possible.  I had some better beans (freeze dried) that I'll probably go back to since I do love edamame beans.

I'm not even going to offer these to anyone to take off my hands because it would be too embarrassing.  Hate wasting food but they're going in the trash.";negative
hmm idk what to put this in;negative
I had really enjoyed a sample I'd received, so I think it's possible that the product I ultimately ordered from Amazon should have been better.  If quality control is so inconsistent, I guess I wouldn't take a chance again.  I guess either something went wrong in the recipe, or in the filling of the tea bags at the factory, or maybe it was stored too long in the wrong conditions, because the product was really weak.  Too bad.;negative
Great tasting cofee but NOT woth 30$ - tastes like the 6$ Trader Joe's house blend and 7 $ Dunkin donuts regular coffee. which are also great....so unless you are into exotic coffess I would opt a for a cheaper brand...;negative
over half the pieces were smashed;negative
I expected what is pictured. What I got is maybe something similar but the packaging is sticky and dirty, the product inside looks wet and theres no way Id let anyone eat this. This was supposed to go in a gift bag, now Im just grossed out. I never leave negative reviews, but be warned!;negative
This turns out to be contaminated with Peanuts and/or Tree Nuts.  I verified it several times myself.  And its not just the Buckwheat flour, but also the other flours (like the Organic Brown Rice flour) sold by Arrowhead Mills aka Hain Celestial.  And the worst part is, they don't even put a warning on the label.  Don't they know that they could kill somebody???  This company does not care about food or customers health, only short term profit.  Stop buying all of their products and find someone that can provide clean, uncontaminated products.;negative
Each of these bottles holds only 3.5 tablespoons of flavoring, yet the discription listed this as a pound of flavoring which is 32 tablespoons last time I checked.  For a price of over 10$ that's too pricey for my blood. The only flavor I liked was the egg nog, the other two were tasteless.  This was the worst item I've bought on amazon in a long time, don't waste your money on this.;negative
VERY disappointed with the product. Flavors are weak and yucky. The 5 pack has terrible flavors. Had to squirt quite a bit to taste flavor Better off buying the small 1-2 oz  bottle product by other vendors. Vanilla and coconut are INCREDIBLE (from other vendors on Amazon).;negative
I would give this negative stars if I would. I always buy numi and have never had a problem (or at least not one I noticed, which mortifies me even more). I store these in an airtight container as soon as I get them. My sister called me today saying she had bugs on her same tea. I went to look at mine and sure enough, stare long enough and you will notice little brown LIVE bugs crawling around the tea. Once you see them, they look huge. I am sooo grossed out. I thought Numi is the top of the top, cream of the crop brand but this is just disgusting. Now, I understand organic means that it can be infested with bugs because it is not heavily sprayed with pesticides as my hubby joked but isn't there some way they can quality control for this not to happen? This has seriously tainted my purchase of loose leaf teas from any brand really. But I certainly won't be paying the high price of numi to be drinking live steamed bugs. Maybe it's a bad batch but I won't take any more chances. I don't pay Numi prices to have to stare down my tea for live creatures. I pay to drink quality tea without worrying about harmful pesticides.;negative
"I have purchased this brand for about 5 months now, (in K-cup).
I thought I would try and save money and make my own K-cup,
( I grounded it up to as close as I could get consistency wise), as the K-cup is.
For some reason it did not have the same flavor.
Since I purchased 3 bags and have 2 left I am going to try to make it by the pot full,
if we ever connect up our bunn system again. We liked the K-cups so well we put
our coffee maker away.";negative
I don't know how these coffees all get good reviews. They have robusta in the blend. I can taste the sourness. For the price that is simply not good enough. People complain about Starbucks but at least Starbucks uses all aribica in their coffees.;negative
"I did not know any non-calorie sugar could taste this good! Especially not Stevia which I disliked. Used to have a bitter aftertaste. This tastes like SUGAR! Better than any sweetener that has ever been in the market. And so beneficial to your health.

I don't know how they did it, but this product deserves 10 stars.

I loved this product until I discovered it was the culprit for my diarrhea. And it was NOT a minor symptom, it was SERIOUS. I have now switched to a 100% Stevia product.";negative
Can clearly states PRODUCT of CHINA.  With all of the recurring food adulteration scandals in China and the significant environmental issues, I will not be eating anything produced in that country.  I opened a can and the peaches were brown, discolored and tasted odd and off.  I will be canceling my subscription for this item.;negative
I've had Bob's Sweet Stripes Mints many times before and love them. I purchased the tub for a trade show booth giveaway figuring they would be a hit with customers. Unfortunately, the candies in the tub had a residual plastic flavor. This was completely unlike my previous experience with this candy. I thought it could be a result of being stored in the tub for too long even though each candy was individually wrapped.;negative
I love coconut water. To be more specific, I love GOOD coconut water. My preferred brand after trying just about every one on the market is the Taste Nirvana which is smooth, only slightly sweet and very refreshing. The Taste Nirvana Lite with pulp is a bout 50% sweeter than the regular and is very good as well with the pulp being crisp and fresh. Goya runs a close second. I am not sure if it's the tetra packs or just the coconut water itself that makes Zico taste a little sour to me. Coconut water should not taste sour. Despite the rave reviews, I think the Zico water is just not as good as the Nirvana or Goya. Sorry I bought a whole case without trying it first.;negative
"Hard candies with a strong peppermint taste and a bit of an odd aftertaste. I can't say that I'm crazy about them but maybe they will be good if I have an upset stomach. I was disappointed to see that my bag was manufactured in 2014 and will expire in two months. Since I'm not eating them for pleasure then I will probably still have most of them at that time. I'm not sure why they have ""natural flavor"" in addition to peppermint. Even ""unnatural"" Starlight mints are just flavored with peppermint. Think I'll get those next time.";negative
I have used this honey for many months.  Until recently the honey has been very good.  However, in my last order, one bottle was beginning to thicken and crystallize.  Yesterday, 2 out 3 bottles are no longer usable as they have thickened to a solid mass.  Neither of the two, out of three, are usable.;negative
"I tried the shirataki noodles and the rice is no different.  However, since they are small little ""dots"" similar to pastina or orzo they are easier to eat but they don't hold any sauce or gravy.  Its a shame because they are so healthy.  The texture is not good.  They are slippery.  Once you rinse both the noodles and rice at least 5 times in cold water, there is no smell but I just can't get past the texture.  Unfortunately for me, I bought 6 packages.  Can't waste my money so they will be a good filler to add to my dog's food.";negative
I highly recommend you don't waste your money. The almonds are so spongy that after you chew them you end up with a mouthful of yuck to spit out. Disgusting, considering the price. Plus nonreturnable, so get burnt that way too. Two thumbs down from me and my husband!;negative
I bought these because when I get them out of the vending machine at work they are absolutely delicious. I saw the other bad reviews but I decided to buy anyway. What I received were packages that were about to expire and the contents inside each package were stale.;negative
I will start by saying I love stevia! I have used it for years in just about every form there is (powder, liquid, packets, teas, etc) so I do understand it's taste and concentration. Unfortunately, this stuff just taste nasty no matter how you mix it! I've tried using less, I've tried using more, nothing helps. So far, I have only tried the strawberry so I'm hoping other flavors are better, but this one is just not drinkable, sorry.;negative
"The soup is fine.  Typical Campbell's chunky soup.  Decent taste, very high sodium content.  OK for a quick meal now and then.  But my shipment consisted of nearly all dented cans.  Does not really hurt anything, but clearly these cans were ""salvaged"" and repackaged for sale here to people who could not see their condition.  That's fine, but I'd expect some disclosure and a better price for dented goods.  Current price is about the same as local prices.";neutral
"I love all Chef Boyardee products, but I lament
over how much sodium they have.  It's 750 mg
sodium per serving (and they say there are 2
servings per can) so if you eat a whole can
like many people do, you would be getting a
whopping 1500 mg of sodium!  High blood
pressure city!  It's great that this product
has whole grain pasta, and the taste is very
good, but it would be much better with less
salt.";neutral
Generally speaking this is a good granola bar. The texture is nice and chewy, a little more moist than many bars out there, yet it also has crunch to it. There's a layer of fudge-like topping over the oats, and and that's topped with flaked coconut and nuts. The overall taste is sweet, chocolatey, slightly nutty with hints of coconut. The reported sugar content is relatively low at 7g per bar, but when you read the ingredient list it seems there's a lot of different sweet ingredients (syrup, cane juice, chocolate liquor, honey, to name just a few) These bars are just a bit too sweet for me to say I love them, but I enjoy one every once in a while when I crave something sweet and chocolatey.;neutral
I tried some of this tea yesterday evening.  I have been battling adrenal and hypothyroid problems and getting much better through the use of natural glandulars (Armor thyroid is natural, as is cortef) products and many supplements and healthy life choices in general.  Last night and today, after the tea, I felt awful.  My morning underarm temp had dropped significantly and I just feel cold in general. I have been weak and tired and shaky all day, though at first I did not know why. Should have researched more first, but like most teas oolong tea has flouride and that is bad for a hypothyroid condition.  I can't guarantee the tea is the reason for the downturn, but it is something to think about if you get it and feel the same way. I am giving this product 3 stars because it came quickly, was nicely boxed and tastes fine.;neutral
I really was not impressed with these almonds. Now keeping in mind that reviews of food items are a matter of personal taste..........I read all the reviews with people raving about these nuts. I don't like the way they taste, at all. To me, they have a strange, kind of chemically taste. They are also smaller, uniformly sized nuts than other brands. I tried these as they were cheaper (at the time) than my usual brand I ate them as I'm not wasteful, but I went back to the OH Nuts brand. I like the taste of them better. OH Nuts brand come in a resealable bag, are not uniform in size, and taste a bit smokier than other brands. There is just more depth of flavor to the OH Nuts brand. I'll stick with them. And although I can't recommend the Trader Joe's brand, you should try them yourself. I would suggest buying the smallest amount you can for your first order, though.;neutral
I'm sure this product my be good for some cooking requirements, but not for the average recipes we've tried.  The meat has a funny smell, texture and taste to us.  I tried this with a pasta sauce and no one like it.  So the next time I tried it with Hamburger Helper and then Shepard's pie but ended up with the same results - leftovers to throw away.  I have not tried it with chilly yet, but feel it may be most suited for that purpose as the meet is so finely ground and the smell with be covered up by the tomatoes, peppers and onions.  Maybe we're just not cooking it properly, but for now we've decided to go back to fresh hamburger meat.  Sorry I can't give a higher rating.;neutral
More sweetness than flavor.;neutral

I can't even taste the peach and the boxed ones aren't at all like the single packet tea bags I bought somewhere - can't remember where, or I'd get those again.  I consider the Davidson's that I bought from Amazon a waste - sorry.  (The individual tea bags were also Davidson's, and they were great.)  I guess they'd be ok for someone who just wants plain old tea.;neutral
Hit or miss functionality.;neutral
I thought this would be more impressive.  Sadly, not the case.  The gin did not have much flavor and we followed the directions as stated.  Perhaps if we do try again we will allow it to steep longer?  Not sure if I want to spend the money on it, maybe I can find my own blend and do it that way.;neutral
very tasty but very salty;neutral
There is so much glitter in the Aztec (Pharoah's) Gold version of this luster dust. This one almost seemed more fake (yes, I know it's not real) compared to the other one.  It does not have the glitter-like aspect with it and I felt that it just didn't have as much pizzazz.  I go with the Aztec Gold, hands down, every time when I'm asked to do gold confections.;neutral
I've ordered these twice. The first was consistent in dexture and taste.  My second purchase is crumbly and the taste inconsistent and somewhat stale. Not all but enough to wonder if I should reorder. I probably will try something else for now.;neutral
Having Celiac it nice to know there are companies that specialize in gluten free options. Bob's Red Mill makes several excellent GF products. I assumed all their products were gluten free. After eating this for some time and not feeling well I double checked the label. It contains gluten. This is totally my stupidity. They also make a gluten free Muesli and one filled with wheat. If you are gluten free, make sure you watch what you are buying.;neutral
delicious, but way too expensive;neutral
"This review is primarily about the chocolate and not the included Guajillo chili. I did not expect fine chocolate. I bought Taza chocolate expecting it to have an old world unrefined taste. I was not disappointed. Had I been expecting Taza to taste like fine Belgian chocolate, I would have rated it only 1 star. It tasted like it was concocted in a primitive outdoor setting over an open fire. I could taste the gritty sugar which hadn't fully dissolved. Even the cheapest American chocolate tasted better than Taza. Yet, I kept going back for another piece of this old world chocolate. Is this what chocolate tasted like before the Europeans refined the process? Though I probably won't purchase anymore Taza chocolate, I am glad that I had the opportunity to try it.

  The Guajillo chili was a great bonus for me.  I love spicy hot food. It was a rare treat to actually taste the chili and the mild heat.";neutral
This is an okay sauce.  Rather bland and non descript, but it can be a good addition to your table.  I bought this as a dipping sauce for Chinese dumplings, and it works okay.  Not sure why, but it feels like it is missing something.;neutral
"So this is what anyone of us could make with powdered sugar, butter, & vanilla.  However, the packaging makes it easy to store and make.  You are going to want to use a mixer and may or may not need to add liquid to thin.  PLEASE take note and frost on cooled cakes/cupcakes as instructed or the frosting will run and make one droopy mess!  You may also want to experiment on the baked good with a little of the thicker frosting because for some reason the vanilla version of this brand tends to soften and run more one on the product.  I actually put mine on thick right out of the mixer without adding extra liquid and it works great for cupcakes.  I do add just a TINY bit of extra liquid for application on cakes to make it easier so as not to tear the cake.  While the flavor is great I do find it to be a bit sweeter than I expected so I balance it accordingly on a chocolate baked good which appears to balance it best.  I will say the convenience is nice and my family enjoy this.  BTW this product will do better refrigerated after application since the butter softens; it does harden when refrigerated also due to the butter.";neutral
"So I previously reviewed this syrup with 5 stars based on my liking it a lot, but after hearing my husband complain about it and how he does not like it at all. I decided to modify my review. I believe the likability of this syrup depends on how you take your coffee normally.

I have been using this as flavoring to my normal morning coffee, which has just milk in it. I think it tastes wonderful this way, but I have trained myself over the years not to drink too sweet a coffee. (Other brand syrups often are too sweet for me and I am not able to use ""sugar-free syrups since they give me migraines.) However, my husband who drinks black coffee has tried twice to add this syrup to his coffee and he said he has had to throw out the coffee because it tastes ""oily"".

I would recommend this to people who want a little pumpkin flavor (and who apparently like to put milk in their coffee). If you are like my husband maybe stick to flavored coffee beans/grounds to avoid the ""oily"" taste.

Something to note, that is an added bonus... they include a pump with the bottle. Other brands make you buy the pumps separately.";neutral
I drink Rooibus and Honeybush regularly.  Overall, good quality (although I preferred Inaba and Kalahari) and I like the organic aspect, but this doesn't strike me as bulk tea (having bought many loose, bulk teas in the past from various internet tea merchants), as much as crushed leaf remnant, more like what what we would find in a tea bag or even remainders of the sorting process.  If someone knows better, I would stand corrected.;neutral
"To be fair, I'm not the ""Patch of Eczema here, patch of Eczema there"" kind of person.  I'm head to toe, since birth - so I'm fairly used to things not working very well :)  However, I was really hopeful for this after seeing the reviews.  It smells like a handful of fresh coconut, which I thought was nice!  I liked the smell.  It's very mild.  You do have to scrape it ouf of the container and let it melt in your hands before applying.  You get used to it.  It doesn't absorb as well as other oils.  Kinds of sits on the surface, so before bed is best.  I still use it occasionally mixed with other creams and lotions.  On it's own, it wasn't enough for my skin.  No miracle cure here.  But its still a nice smelling body oil.

I did not eat it.  I have stomach issues that make that easier said than done :)";neutral
Too sweet!  I don't really like it.;neutral
downgraded a great product a wonderful product I bought lots and lots of it when it was priced reasonably. I bought less when it started to get higher.. Now  I want more but the price is  OUTRAGEOUS..  SO NOW  its just a tease.  Who spends this this much for a box of coffee??/;neutral
These aren't bad, but holy cow are they covered in powered sugar. I had trouble opening the inside so had to put a bit of muscle into it. Well, the powder sugar exploded out all over me and the floor from the force. Its so covered in this powdered sugar that its hard to tell what flavor is the one you're biting into until you lick the sugar off. But they taste pretty good. The green ones taste kinda funky.;neutral
"Even though I was looking for just a mix of various beans when I bought this ""Bob's Red Mill Soup Mix, 13 Bean, 29-Ounce Units (Pack of 4),"" I've got to agree with some of the other reviewers who take issue with Bob's Red Mill calling it a ""Soup Mix.""  A soup mix should include various spices to actually make a soup.  This is just a very nice selection of dried beans.  That out of the way, I've got to say the real reason I'm only rating this at an OK 3 stars out of 5 is because I'm not all that happy with the specific mix of beans in it.  In particular, the Yellow and Green Split Peas.  I found that they overrode the flavors of all the other beans in the package.  But, since those ingredients are fully spelled out on the label, I can't complain too much.  I'll just have to keep looking for a mix that meets my needs (or, heck, just buy quantities of various dried beans and make my own mix).";neutral
They'll be fine for the trick or treaters.  The cookies seem fresh enough.  I just think the taste is a little off.  I guess this is the way they usually taste though.  I wish they were sweeter too.  And they kind of stick in the package and are a little crumbly when you try to take a cookie out.;neutral
I just got my KEURIG single serve coffee maker a little while ago and went crazy here on Amazon looking for different coffees and teas that would work with my system.  I love herbal tea and the variety included in this 22 count set are the flavors I like - good variety.  Sleepytime is my all time favorite.  The Celestial Seasoning teas work great and the set was exactly what I expected.  I am very pleased with it.  But I am not pleased with the price and am angry at myself for not researching prices for this product elsewhere before buying.  So if the price is fine with you I highly recommend this set of 22 Celestial Seasoning single serving cups.  Just be sure to read in the description what you will be receiving and make sure they are the flavors you want.  And also be aware that there are other places to get it much cheaper.  But the teas are truly delicious.  Of that you can be sure.;neutral
Bought for someone else.;neutral
"I was a little mislead, but maybe it's my own mistake.
In the photos, it's said a serving size was ""one block of noodles"" and there were two in each package. I made the assumption that one block = about the same portion as a block of maruchan ramen. But it's half; the entire package, while split in two, is equal to one package of ramen,
I thought this was going to be a much lower calorie alternative to regular ramen (since one block/package of regular ramen is around 400.) but really it's not much lower in calories at all. And it's much more expensive. If I knew the portions were that small I wouldn't have paid $24. That's $1 a piece for a chunk of ramen about the same size and width as a hamburger patty.
The taste is nearly identical to regular Ramen to me";neutral
It's okay. The popcorn doesn't fully pop before it wants to burn, so you have to keep a close eye on it.  Kettle Corn flavor is subtle, not too sweet.  Kernels popped are on the small side.  The positive side of it is the low cal and low fat.;neutral
Its suppose to be good for ya.;neutral
Taste great ! Way to expensive!!!;neutral
No problems with baking. The bread turned out fine but didn't have that sweetness I was expecting. It was a little bit sweet but nothing like King's Hawaiian bread you can get at the grocer. I baked 2 boxes and gave the rest to friends and family for gifts. They said the same thing, it's okay but nothing special. Meh.;neutral
this stuff is way too expensive.;neutral
Bought these to give out on Halloween. Was not impressed with the flavor at all. Nothing much good to say about them. Apparently chocolate manufacturers have been cutting corners as well as raising prices nonstop since I was a little boy.;neutral
This to me, was okay. I will say it is very pure, and very strong. A little goes a very long way. I made a mistake in using too much, and the end result was extreme bitterness. This was my error, not a reflection of the product. The main reason I'm only giving 3 stars is due to the packaging. It is extremely messy, and no matter what I do, powder goes everywhere upon opening and using. Maybe it is just user error, but I've never had this problem with other Stevia products. Overall, a pretty good product, definitely pure 100% Stevia.;neutral
Not much flavor here, I think I prefer a more brisk green or black tea. If you like a really light mellow tea you may like this. I bought it more for the health benefits then the taste but was hoping for a little more flavor.;neutral
"This coffee is delicious! Smooth, strong, and in perfect balance; not bitter at all, almost a chocolaty taste... However, I am now almost sorry I reviewed this item so highly, since then the price has gone up significantly; almost thirty percent! What a shame...";neutral
I read that this flavor was the best in coffee.  I had bought vanilla creme and chocolate.  The kids LOVE the chocolate to make chocolate milk and the vanilla does not go to waste using it in recipes instead of sugar and vanilla.  Really good.  I haven't played around with how many drops is necessary to make a good sweet cup of coffee but I tried about 6 drops today and it wasn't sweet just had that artificial flavor that I have a hard time tolerating.  I will keep trying.  It has a good flavor but has a strong alcohol taste as they all do so for now I will say that its OK.  Will report back after trying a few extra drops.  Maybe 12 ? Great concept though;neutral
These are good but beware of the rotten ones! Talk about a nasty surprise when you pop a couple of these into your mouth and you crunch into a moldy one! Not to mention trying to get the taste out of your mouth when all the moldy spores and such are stuck in your teeth. Super yummy. Not really. When you don't get the bad ones they are good. Also, if you think you can look at these little liars and think you will be able to tell that its moldy inside, good luck unless you have x-ray vision. Best of luck!;neutral
Tasty but if you leave it sitting for a day or three it's likely to start growing mold. Ok, that's not the way one is supposed to 'eat' tea but I do. I guess I'm spoiled by the natural[?] antibioticity of Bigelow orange flavored herbal tea which will sit for a day or three and never mold.;neutral
We are always looking for zero calorie alternatives to soda.  Crystal Light as a range is an excellent product, always dissolves well and is consistent.  This particular mix was a bit sweet for me.  It tasted far more strawberry than banana.  I didn't mind it,  but it's sweeter than other selections in the crystal light range.  We will finish it,  but I don't know that we will order more.;neutral
I never use the whole sauce packet, there's some fish sauce in it that just overwhelms the whole bowl with a salty taste I don't like. If I use 1/2 or less of the sauce packet it doesn't overwhelm the dehydrated veggies, and is ok - not my favorite though.;neutral
"Review update - 7/12/2012
I'm sad to say that the new, purple box packaging for this tea contains artificial flavors.  Why, oh why, did Good Earth have to change this tea, when it was perfectly fine and good the way it was?  I am terribly disappointed by this change, and have amended my star rating to reflect this.

Original Review - 10/4/2010
First, to the Natural/Artificial concerns - it really does say Natural Flavors in the ingredient list, NOT artificial as some of the reviews state.  Box also states ""No sugar, caffeine, artificial flavors, colors or preservatives"".  I've submitted a picture of the ingredients list to Amazon, which you can view at the top of this item page.

Ingredients list:
Red Rooibos, Chicory Root, Natural Flavor, Rosehips, Cinnamon, Lemongrass, Peppermint, Papaya, Chamomile, Panax Ginseng Leaves, Anise Seed, Dandelion Root, Ginger Root, Orange Oil, Orange Peel.

I was given my first box of this tea by a friend who knew I liked cinnamon tea.  Up to that point, my favorite tea was Celestial Seasonings' Bengal Spice.  But when I tried Good Earth, I fell in love!  Now I cannot find it anymore in any of the local stores that carried it, so I signed up for the regular shipments from Amazon.

Everyone I have shared this tea with tell me how much they enjoy it, that it hardly seems possible for tea to have such intense flavor and not need sweetening.  I have to be sure to get some before my husband & kids finish the box without my getting a chance to have a few myself!  Seems like every time I visit my mom now, she makes up some of this for us to share as some iced tea.

I do not use any sweetener, which says a lot because I use sweetener with pretty much every other kind of herbal tea I drink.  Good Earth is great hot or cold, and it sure does give my tastebuds a gingerbread-like warmth on a fall or winter morning.  There is no tea-ish, bitter taste or aftertaste.

If you love cinnamon, gingerbread, or a really good caffeine-free tea that doesn't need sweetening, give this one a try!";neutral
"These taste pretty good if you are a fan of dried veggie chips in general (I am). They aren't the freshest tasting ones I've ever had but they are much less expensive than some others as well.

I ordered them twice actually. The first time I received a bag of carrot chips instead of the mixed veggies I ordered. I contacted them (through Amazon) and they were super nice. They offered me a choice of free replacement (keep the carrots) or refund. I had already ordered another bag of the mixed chips just because the carrots were so good. Consequently I chose the refund and I assume it was done; I haven't checked my statement.

I also bought the green bean snacks from the same company. They have a slight ""off"" flavor, I think from the oil they use to process them. I wish they (and other food vendors) would get on board and stop using canola oil. Maybe it's a lot cheaper but I'd be willing to pay more (lots more) for olive oil, coconut oil, anything except PUFAs and/or corn oil. Those are unhealthy, inflammatory, and go rancid too quickly.

Customer service was quick and friendly. I'll buy from them again if they change to a healthier oil. Oh, these also have dextrin as an ingredient. That could be a deal breaker for some people with food sensitivities. But that's it as far as ingredients - no chemicals, no artificial flavors or colors. Hats off to them for that.";neutral
"I hate to give this product such a low rating because it tastes so delicious, so let me explain. I don't know how other people pop their corn, but I use a hot air popper. I used a 1/4 cup of kernals as I usually did, and was dismayed that I only had about a 1/2 a bowl of popped corn compared to what I usually got. After eating the popped corn, I noticed the bottom of the bowl had a whole bunch of unpopped kernals. I finally realized these kernals explode with so much force that they blow many of the unpopped kernals right out of the popper into the bowl. They also blow many of the popped kernals over the bowl all over the counter and floor. Many times an upopped kernal will still be so hot, that it'll pop after it gets into the bowl consequently blowing more popped kernals all over the place.
I don't get any waste tho. I put the unpopped kernals back into the popper for the next time and they eventually get popped. But the whole process is irritating. I'm sorry, but I won't buy this brand again. I see that others have used a large pot with a lid over the stove flame. I might try that, but as a bachelor I don't like having to wash another item.";neutral

"This is not a suitable sugar substitute.

"I rated these chocolate covered coffee beans ""okay"", because there so much chocolate that it overpowers the coffee taste.  My preference is a dominate espresso bean flavor enhanced by a thin dark chocolate cover.  Of course, if you are a chocaholic, this is the one for you. Great vendor to buy from.";neutral
I bought this for my burner and found that, for the price, there wasn't the bang for the buck I expected. This product is VERY expensive for the size, and I was disappointed that it took quite a bit to get the scent dispersal I was looking for, especially because it was Soo expensive. I've bought cheaper, similar products on Amazon that were stronger for less money;neutral

I had purchased a jar of Fisher's dry roasted seeds, and was absolutely hooked on the flavor. I ordered these, hoping to get a similar product at a good price. I was flexible. I was also disappointed. These are just ok. They've got a bit of an oily taste. I would say these are lightly toasted, but certainly not dry roasted. I won't be reordering.;neutral
This is a really nice light herbal tea. Its not very strong, but it still has a light mint aftertone. It is the first tea I have bought that has chocolate chips in it which is kind of wierd. I don't recomand this if tea if you won't use all of it very fast because the chocolate could spoil.;neutral
I prefer black silk better.;neutral
The syrup itself has a decent flavor, it just takes so much of it to make the taste strong enough. While we liked it using the SodaStream, we will probably not order it again due to the weak flavor and need to use so much. Makes it not very cost effective.;neutral
Okay, but not worth the money;neutral
I have order this brand multiple times, this last batch's flavor is somewhat weak.  Not sure what happened here.  Now instead of a full cup of coffee with each K Cup I prepare a little more than one half, to try and obtain its flavor.;neutral

this K-Cup design is NOT 2.0 compatible! The plastic K-Cup has thicker plastic which puts strain on the needle mechanism. The needle is flimsy and will eventually break off making the coffee maker useless. It did last 1 year for me but this is really a defective design. So buyer beware.;neutral
These are ok but not great. I really prefer the betty crocker ones because they taste much better and you only have to use water instead of having milk on hand to make these. Unfortunately, they don't have the betty crocker ones available for subscribe and save so I got these.;neutral
The product itself was to be expected.  Shipping however, was AWFUL.  The cans broke apart during shipping.  50% of the cans came severely dented so badly that opening with a can opener was not possible.  They were not packed with anything to protect them in anyway during transport.  For this reason we will most likely not reorder.;neutral

For the money, I think this Folgers series of coffees is pretty tasty -- I've had 3 different ones now.  However, I was expecting a better chocolate flavor based on the other reviews it's received.  Though I typically like the bitterness of (dark) chocolates, this cocoa flavor has a slightly unpleasant bitterness to my buds -- It may even be a sourness -- I'm not quite sure yet.  Since I got it during a sale, I'm not too disappointed.  It's drinkable, but I plan to do some blending with other grinds, to see if I can subdue the odd flavor that comes through.;neutral
Not the best,too sweet, is ok!;neutral
"Purchased this with the thought of trying each of the 4 seasonings on my hot air popped popcorn.  One of them (the Buttery Jalapeno) is clumped at the top.  Pretty solid actually.  So even though I poked through it (using a kitchen tool), it was still pretty clumped and useless.

It's also VERY salty.  That said, my teenage son and I love the Ranch one, putting it on Chili (a small amount of the Ranch seasoning on the chili), helps even out some of the saltiness.  And adds a little taste to the Chili.  But seriously, this is very salty tasty.

As for those complaining that it just falls to the bottom?  Spray your popcorn with some Olive Oil spray (like from Pam or another brand) or some Extra Virgin Olive Oil in a spray bottle, and spritz it on the hot air popped popcorn, then sprinkle seasoning on, and it sticks and doesn't taste gross.";neutral
"howdy y'all,

this is nothing more than a bland, chunky version of chicken & veggie soup with rice. i was expecting a bit more flavor. with ""savory"" in the name it seems like it otta be tastier.
- the rice is nice
- the chicken chunks are rather small
- the flavor is rather bland

rated this a THREE cuz there is nothing either for or against it. i really think it otta have more flavor.

take care,

"Having never tried Biltong, I cannot comment on this products authenticity.  I would like to offer an opinion on the flavor & texture from a American ""jerky"" perspective.

The closest American thing I can compare it to is the dried beef you find in little glass jars at the grocery.  Not a horrible flavor, but certainly not the beef taste I was hoping for. It tastes aged, almost like cheese.  It was sliced very thin and the texture was dry, lean, and smooth.";neutral

I don't think these are worth the extra money spent buying them from Amazon, as there are rice noodle products available locally for less.";neutral
I have been consuming this product for a few days now and I find that the quality is not as good as some others I've had. First this is a mix of cacao beans and normally I wouldn't mind but I think this has been giving me stomach upset/ heartburn. Perhaps I've just been using too much as I put it in my coffee and in my smoothies, but I've been doing so for years with another brand with no problem. Anyway, there are slight lumps or clumps in the bag, it's not powdery smooth as some others. I still like it and it has good strong flavor and for the price it was definitely worth it as I paid just under $10 here on Amazon. A good product, not the best.;neutral
The Starbucks Via has an acceptable flavor, but they all leave an unpleasant grit on the tongue and lack the aroma of a brewed coffee.  If you are a coffee aficionado, Via is not a great experience.  Even so, it is much better than the free Ronoco coffee we have where I work and is nice to have for travel.  I consider Via strictly a backup.;neutral

"Arrived solid as a rock-two separate layers inside the jar. Warmed it slightly to get it out of the jar and to be able to mix the two layers together inside of a separate bowl. The taste is just ok.
Went back to two rock hard separate layers about an hour later. Too much trouble to keep warming it up just to be able to mix the layers together. Won't buy this brand again.";neutral
"I purchased 2 flavors of Tortuga Rum cake in the same order, this one and Banana Rum. This one did not live up to expectations unlike the Banana Rum. The flavor was Rum dominated with small hints of Key lime. Although the Packaging Vacuum seal was intact and obviously of a high quality, the cake itself was not as moist as I would have liked it. Comparing it to the Banana Rum cake moisture I can say that the issue must have been with the actual preparation of this cake. I would recommend that Tortuga closely examine the recipe and tweak it a bit. Not that this cake was terrible, but it just was about average at best. In other words it is on the same level as another Brand Name Rum cake one can purchase online, so if they are ok with the competition catching them or maybe even edging them out a bit, then they should not change a thing. But I as a customer have scratched this one of my re-order list for a while until its quality is addressed. I give this Rum Cake a ""C+"" grade when compared to other Brand Name Rum Cakes.";neutral
When they say hot and spicy, World Kitchens is one of the few companies that means it, right down to the seeds of the peppers coating the jerky.  It's not like eating a jalapeno straight, but it will definitely make your mouth burn if you are not used to eating hot items.  When I buy pork rinds, I always get the hot & spicy and I cover my moon pies in tabasco (just kidding).  If you like heat you'll like the flavor of this jerky but unfortunately, it was too much for me.  I guess I'll need to turn in my redneck card.  Big strips and the texture is good.

It's very cute and the presentation looks great for gifts and events. I gave this to my fiancee as a gift and she loved how it looks. She didn't even want to eat it because it was 'too cute.' The downside to this is how sweet it is. It's overwhelmingly sweet even by sugar lovers. We had our whole family try it and they all agree that it was overwhelmingly sweet and hard to handle without feeling tired or extremely thirsty. The cupcake itself is about the size of a dollar coin, relatively small but each packing 10g of sugar and 105 calories. Just trying four out of the six flavors is 420 calories and as much sugar as a can of coke!;neutral
This is a very strong, spicy cinnamon tea, great for cold days.  However, you do need to really like cinnamon to enjoy this tea.  I find I have to be in the right mood for it, as it can be overpowering.  In contrast, I have a friend who LOVES it, and just bought her 2nd box of 50 bags of this tea. It's well-blended, but it's serious about its cinnamon.;neutral
I liked the coffee - bold to my taste - my only issue is that some of the capsules in the box are not easily opened by the Keurig machine.  I had issues where it would not puncture the capsule and leak water everywhere.  I now use another brand that is strong and works with my Keurig without any problems;neutral
Just me? I thought it was OK but not as flavorful as everyone else claimed. I was disappointed. It was, however, NOT bitter which is a plus. I won't reorder. Tasted like just coffee-flavored water to me even when I made it stronger.;neutral
Usually when I purchase these, they are much softer and easier on the teeth, and a bit larger.

The size of the pieces looked like they were stunted or miniature Mandarins (clementines), so small.  I guess it depends on the seller and their stock.

awful; I can't even tell what they are supposed to be.  I wish the candy makers would stick with the tried-

This ramen is some of the best I have had.  The spice level is on point which is awesome.  But, at the end of the day, it's ramen.

"Kona being one of my favorite coffees, I was excited to find this product for 50 Kona blend k-cups at a reasonable price. The taste is not what I associate with Kona - a bit strong. I generally prefer bold coffee brands, but Kona is traditionally supposed to be a light roast. This is overpowering enough to leave an aftertaste.  I tried it with Splenda and half and half, and the artificial sweetener does NOT mix well with the flavor.  I tried it next with honey and then agave syrup, and these worked a little better. The flavor is not terrible -- I have had worse -- but I won't order this blend again. It isn't flavorful enough to justify 50 k-cups of just ""OK"" tasting coffee no matter how reasonably priced it is. Any k-cup that reminds me of something I could get free from the office break room will not make the cut in my pantry at home.";neutral
This is the second time I have purchased these berries.  I do love them, although this batch seems to have a kinda funny taste and smell.  I am not sure if that is normal.  I have eaten a few, but I really need to contact the supplier to make sure that they are ok to consume.;neutral
I generally prefer a light or medium roast coffee, as the flavor tends to have more nuances, the texture tends to be smoother, and the caffeine level is higher. With that being said, this coffee is definitely delicious, with chocolate nuances (didn't taste any caramel influence) but had a flavor and texture closer to a medium-dark roast. It was smooth, it was not bitter, but it seemed slightly 'heavy' for lack of a better word! HUGE 2 lb bag is a plus when you love coffee as much as I do, but I wasn't entirely sure how long the coffee was in the bag before I purchased it, as there was no manufacturing date nor batch date on the bag [that I received]. I noticed that 'Don Pablo' himself responds to questions himself, promptly and courteously, so for that and for the fact that he offers a whole bean, light roast, and that it's organic, definitely a full three stars! I also like that it is a family of coffee growers and not a big corporation with no noticeable responsibility. One of the questions asked on this product is whether or not  this coffee contains mycotoxins, to which Don Pablo answered it does not - I do wish that information was included in the description on Amazon (it's not as of the time of this review), because that's a huge plus! I think this is a good coffee, just not a great one. Five stars for customer service and for Don Pablo and his family!;neutral
"I was looking forward to this gluten free soup because the picture looks great.  It does have a starchy taste which happens when noodles are not rinsed after cooking, they are probably cooking the pasta right in with the soup from the start rather than cook and rinse first.  It's hard to find any canned chicken noodle soup gluten free so this is a good start, with canned soup containing pasta starchy soft pasta is probably hard to avoid.

Particularly because rice pasta is extremely starchy I have been partially cooking pasta separately and rinsing and keep in fridge, when heating soup or broth I just add the pasta at the end a couple of minutes prior to eating and it works best.  I got the idea from a restaurant serving soups as a gluten free option - they do not put pasta into the soup until just before serving to prevent mushy pasta.  I will probably go back to this method for soups with noodles but will definitely try some of the other Gluten Free Cafe soups that do not contain pasta.";neutral
I hesitate to post about espresso, because people are very sensitive about what they like and don't like, but, it's all about individual tastes... I don't hate it, but it's not as good as the Lavazza decaf (also water processed. This obviously is more cost effective. This has a bitter/burnt taste.  I'm not actually sure I'm going to make it through the bag.  I might have liked it if I hadn't ordered the Lavazza first, which has a different, almost caramel-y taste.  This is probably more in line with a Starbucks dark roast coffee.  Again, I don't hate it, but after having the less bitter more flavorful decaf, I'm not in love with it.  I also don't like that the bag doesn't verify that it is, in fact, the Water Processed.  I'm going to try a CO2 decaf next- has anyone tried that one?;neutral
"This tastes great IMO, but after you use 2/3 of the bottle, it takes an act of pure magic to get the rest out of the bottle. I turn it upside down and pound the bottle against the counter, but it's still a pain. You shouldn't have to do that.

My first box of these cups was perfect. No issues whatsoever, and the taste was great. My second and third boxes, however, left grounds in my mug with every cup I brewed. At first I thought it was my brewer, but then I tried other K-cups I had and they brewed fine. I also tried these cups in multiple other brewers with the same results. A thick layer of grounds in my mug. The taste was pretty much still good, however I had to scoop out the grounds with a spoon or risk a mouthful. I contacted Amazon and got a refund.

Since it is not fair to judge the product by the packaging,  I would give 3 stars; however, I would not buy this again since the package was bad, bag was open, the product was less than descriptions; and more over, broken package = less sanitary.

By comparison, this one tastes more like salted pork. Not as strong a bacon taste. But it is OK. Maybe I'll try frying it with a little bit of regular bacon next time to give it more flavor. It is very lean so sometimes I add a little olive oil when I fry it.

This is the first time that we have tried this cereal. I thought it would taste like the 'Simple' brand that we were able to buy through Aldi's a few months back. Now those were a 5 star cereal!

It's okay... The picture here shows dark chocolate visibly in the jar, but I am not seeing any. I am pretty sure that's why my daughter requested this flavor, but it's pretty lame IMO.

I bought these because I have a corn allergy and wanted to substitute them for the LA Weightloss bars that list corn syrup as the first ingredient.  I was pleasantly surprised that they were pretty tasty! My favorites are actually the Fudgie Filberts that taste similar to a Little Debbie brownie if Little Debbie's were diet. Following that I would say Almond and Coconut are tied for second. Third is the Peanut Butter which is the highest in protein but not as good as the others. My husband didn't like any of them but could tolerate the one I liked least, Peanut Butter.  Over all I think these are great as a healthy snack for people with food allergies or other dietary restrictions. I think I would have picked a different name than Betty Lou's Nut Butter Balls.

"UPDATE:  I have to take off a star because this stuff is ground too fine and does not play nicely with most coffee pots when you want to make 10 cups.  The fine grind clogs the filter and the units tend to flood.  We recently increased the proportion of this stuff meaning more decaf and the issue was exposed...oh well.

I am just about to re-order this coffee and decided that it deserved a review as a result.  My wife and I are fans of flavored coffee and we make our own concoctions from blending...since we want to arrive at 50% decaf.  With this coffee we blended a dark roast Gevalia bought locally from a market that generally has excellent pricing for that product.  Well, I am reordering...so I guess that means that we like it.  Gevalia also makes this type of flavored coffee, more expensive and it possibly has a stronger chocolate flavor.  The raspberry flavor is really enhanced in the Coffee Masters, which is not necessarily a bad thing, just needed to get used to it and apparently I have.  I have made this coffee on its own and find it just as appealing.  I do understand people have different tastes, but if you are a coffee fan at all, you could never rate this as bad tasting.  You may not be a coffee fan and really want your coffee to taste like hot chocolate with raspberry syrup and yeah, this would not be that great.  I love coffee though and this stuff is pretty good.";neutral

The candies did taste fresh on a good note.;neutral
I purchased the 1000 quantity for $60 as I had previously purchased just a few boxes. I like the product and think it tastes great. My problem is many of the packets are empty or nearly empty. I do not believe I got the best bang for my buck.;neutral

I ordered these for my children who have several food allergies.  They aren't the best tasting granola bar we've ever had, but they aren't bad either.  The kids like them and eat them regularly.  It's always nice to find a product that doesn't have a lot of junk in it.  We're fans of Annie!;neutral
"I was somewhat disappointed in the taste and texture of this product. One of my favorite rices is Jasmine, Basmati and Brown. And one of my favorite and most trusted brands is Lundberg. Failing that, I will try to buy USA and definitely items made in California. I've bought a different brand of Brown Jasmine rice before. When I saw this product offered, I jumped at the chance to buy it.
The texture is not as smooth as I would have liked. And it's not as tasty as I expected it to be.
I bought 6 bags, so, if there are any changes as I'm using the bags, I will update this review.
I really enjoy some of Lundber'gs other rice varieties. I'm not sure why this one was not as good as I've come to expect.";neutral
"The taste is very salty for salmon roe. The appearance is somewhat ""gummy"" looking. It works when combined with chopped hard-boiled eggs, chopped raw onion and creme fraiche. I prefer thinly slices baguette to blinis and this helps to make the whole combination tasty.";neutral
I would really like to give this 5 stars as it tastes great and is easy to fix, but the portion is so small you would have to double or triple it up for an adult size meal. For kids it would be ok, but for this price not sure if I will buy again or not, maybe if it goes on sale.;neutral

"I drink a whole lot of tea, both hot tea and ice tea.  I also like to try many varieties. I purchased a case of both this regular Swee Touch Nee and the low caffeine version  (it is not decaffeinated !!!) after someone gave me a sample of the low-caff version.  Everyone I have offered it to has loved the low-caffeine version as an ice tea. But this regular version is decent tasting but has very unremarkable flavor, almost indistinct from common store brands like Luzianne, Lipton or Krogers tea bags. That said, there is nothing offensive or bad tasting about this tea, it just offers nothing to make me think I would buy it again. But innocuous flavor may be just what some folks want at times when drinking tea.

The other version of this tea,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Swee-Touch-Nee-Tea-Orange-Pekoe-97-5-Caffeine-Free-24-Count-Tea-Bags-Pack-of-12/dp/B000HQMQR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Swee-Touch-Nee Tea, Orange Pekoe (97.5% Caffeine Free), 24-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 12)</a>&nbsp;is quite remarkable.  With a refreshing and very distinctive flavor, it makes the best ice tea of any I have tried in recent years; very flavorful and easily distinguished from other teas. Unfortunately, Amazon is the only place I have found Swee-Touch-Nee for sale and the low-caffeine variety generally costs about 11 cents per bag and you have to purchase a dozen boxes to get that price.  The regular version was about four cents a bag when I ordered by the case on Amazon.

FYI- This regular Swee-Touch-Nee diffuses more caffeine than any other tea I have ever tried. I usually have no issues with caffeine jitters from tea, but I definitely feel the caffeine when drinking this tea.  As little as three or four cups will rattle me. That may be the reason a version containing low caffeine varieties of tea leaves is marketed under the same name. I'm not fooling, this stuff is loaded with caffeine.  Also, I have been through four boxes of these and not had the split tea bag problem others mentioned, but the strings wick water out of a tea cup amazingly fast and have actually drained a whole cup overnight when I left a full cup sitting on my desk at work once. What a mess that made. I've never had that problem with the strings from other teas and it is a very odd phenomenon.";neutral
This is good, unless you're used to making bread entirely from scratch. It's really hard for a mix to compete with that. I did like it, but found that making the bread from scratch is still a much better option.;neutral
If you are looking for an alternative to beef burgers then this is probably not for you. The texture is strange and the taste is average. I have been trying to find a way to have beef flavor without the calories and fat and this product left me searching. I'm going to mix it with ground turkey or chicken and maybr it will be more satisfying. Maybe had I never tasted juicy beef burgers this would be satisfactory, but it left me dry and craving.;neutral
I was expecting a bit more...maybe more of a chicken flavor, saltiness, something?  To me, it didn't add anymore flavor that I couldn't get with regular salt or actual chicken/poultry seasoning.  I also felt that I had to add a lot of the Chicken salt seasoning to fries or wings just to taste it.  I'm not a huge salt lover anyway, but thought the flavor was lacking.;neutral

I like this creamer, although I don't love it.  I guess to gain this ""Superfood"" status, you sacrifice some taste..and pay a lot more.  There are about 28 servings per pouch which makes it about 54 per serving. Compare that to say Silk's Almond Milk Creamer where each serving is about 11.

It is convenient that it's a powder, so this will likely be my travel creamer (for some reason airlines don't have any non-dairy creamer).  The pouch packaging is also nice.  (Note that even Coffee Mate powder contains casein, a milk derivative, so not vegan.)

The creamer itself has a coconut taste, but it's not overpowering and not nearly as coconutty as some of the liquid coconut-based creamers.  It does clump a bit in your coffee, but I use a little battery powered whisk which mixes it nicely.  Your coffee will not get light in color...more of a dark caramel, mocha color.

For my money, my current favorite completely non-dairy creamer is Coffee Mate's new nut-based Natural Bliss varieties which come in Almond and Coconut flavors.  I prefer the Almond.";neutral
VERY VERY SWEET;neutral
Had I not bought King Arthur Flour's Vermont Cheese Powder before trying this, I would probably be pretty happy. Unfortunately, this brand isn't quite as good. It's more salty than cheese flavor, so in order to get more cheese flavor, it ends up being too salty. I use this just like the powdered cheese that comes with easy mac. It's versitile. I can put it in pasta or rice. I am determined to finish this canister, but after it's gone, I will go back to the King Arthur brand. It's pricier, but has better flavor.;neutral
"I guess I have a high heat tolerance, because this only seemed maybe two or three times as hot as a grocery store habanero. (according to scoville rating, the weaker grocery store habaneros are about ten times less than this, the red savina which I have never tried is supposed to be three times hotter)
That isn't why I'm giving this only three stars though.

First off the taste - it was terrible. I haven't tried the peppers themselves yet, but the powder tastes awful I've tried it with soup and chips, and it worked slightly better with chips - and made my soup taste bad. It's a bit hard to describe - bitter and dry I guess would be the best way to describe it. Not sweet like I expected... I have heard ghost peppers have a somewhat similar sweet taste to the habanero. In this powder though I don't taste that at all.

Second this stuff is very... dust like.
you have to be very careful pouring it, because it is ground so fine that it gets into the air easier than anything I've ever seen. Fortunately when I breathe it in, it doesn't really burn - I guess it's just to small and insignificant of an amount to do that, but it does make me cough a lot.

I'll update the review a bit more once I try out the peppers themselves, even though they are a bonus.

Edit: I got around to trying the peppers themselves, and the taste was similar. Perhaps I just don't like the taste of these peppers. I definitely would not call them sweet tasting at all though.";neutral

I've tried all of the major brand boxed angel food cakes.  IMO, Pillsbury and Duncan Hines are the best, with Duncan Hines edging out Pillsbury for best taste.  Betty Crocker comes in a distant 3rd for taste.  I was able to improve the taste of Betty Crockers angel food cake by using a little more water and adding vanilla and almond extract.;neutral
"One the plus side, I seem to use a lot less of this than I do regular sugar in my coffee. On the down side, I'm not really happy with the taste. It's not bad, just a little strange. Not at all like coconuts - I like coconut flavored coffee and coconut oil (I even like coconut oil in my coffee a la ""Bulletproof Coffee""). I've also found hard particulate matter, just a little bit, in the bottom of my coffee mug. Something I don't see when using regular sugar.

I'm not at all disappointed in my purchase, and I plan on using it all. But I'm not sure I'd buy it again. Truly a YMMV situation.";neutral
I grew up with picked foods - my father pickled just about everything. I was intrigued by beet-marinated eggs because of the vibrant color and found this on Amazon. I have to say that I was a little surprised - I followed the instructions with water and the mix tasted more like beet juice rather than pickle. I messed with it a little bit and added vinegar, kosher salt, a clove of garlic, sliced red onion, and whole peppercorns and it tasted great. My dad always encourages tasting the pickling liquid before adding whatever's to be picked, which makes sense. Anyway, if you don't want to get all fancy, I would just say 2 part vinegar and 1 part water. I otherwise have nothing against this product. It will impart a truly gorgeous red color and earthiness to pickled eggs.;neutral

Bought 12 of them based on fellow reviewers opinions. As an all purpose seasoning so far does a fair job. I have not noticed any greatness so far in this product. I have used it in many different types of food and it is okey. I use several herbs and some spices in cooking and thought this one would be above average but like I said it is average tasting. Hope I am not missing the point here but I did expect a fantastic all around seasoning. I guess the question to ask is: What makes it so special to those reviewers that gave it so many praises? Do not regret the purchase, still have plenty of time to decide if I would buy this product again. They said it worked great with steamed vegetables but I can not endorse that. I tried it on steamed vegetables and I still needed to add a little more to the plate which defeated the idea of just using Knorr Aromat All Purpose Seasoning. I thought I would forego the Mayonnaise but it was not so. 3 to 3.5 Stars at best!;neutral
very disappointed in the way this popcorn popped. it is too dried out to pop easily. I tried air popping it in my microwave and got 1/4 of a batch and the rest unpopped. I tried 3 times.

The only way I got it to pop decently was by adding oil and the it took 5 minutes to complete, not 2 min. like other corns.;neutral
"All 5 plants arrived quickly and in very healthy condition.  However, IF you're expecting colorful specimens you may be disappointed.

Each of my plants was approx. 1 1/2 to  2 inches in length and totally green.  Upon more research, I learned that this particular species (Ionantha Mexican) usually develop their pretty coloring when/if they're ready to bloom and create flowers.  Was I deceived by this seller's listing... No.  Should I have researched the plant more deeply before buying... Yes.

I'll admit, I was hoping for a little ""color"" in at least some of the plants.

Now I plan to give them time and let them grow.  They do look very healthy and for that I'm thankful :)

"I read the reviews and thought I'd give this a try; at first I was disappointed even though I was careful not to add all the oil it had no exceptional taste to me just bland with chewey noodle.

I snack on these for a guilt-free, healthy, low calorie snack. These are super yummy, great value, and perfect portion. The reason I went with a 3 is because I had one bag of the red apple that was so bitter I had to stop eating. It tasted like what a rotten apply must taste like.

"I ordered two types of sesame sticks, the Honey Roasted and the Hot/Spicy.

Both arrived in a large. thick, easy-to-open, re-sealable white bag. When I opened the first bag, I got a strong whiff of chemical smell (guessing the bag). When I tasted the sesame sticks, the smell of the bag really hadn't transferred to the food.

The Honey Roasted or HR: The first bag I opened and tasted happened to be the Honey Roasted but I could tell they were the Honey Roasted til I read the bag label. The Honey Roasted are the narrower sticks and the honey flavor is very, very mild. Also, the HR are not strongly salted ... in fact, I really don't taste salt at all.

The Hot/Spicy or H/S: WOW, talk about salty. They are way too salty for me. Also, the H/S flavor is not a pleasant tasting H/S flavor. I will not be able to eat these by themselves. These sesame sticks are the thicker/wider sticks.

Both the HR and the H/S were fresh tasting. Nothing tasted old nor stale.

I mixed some of the H/S sticks with sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, pecans and it helped to cut the bad/salty taste. I can also use them for salads.

My Kroger is selling the thick, regular sesame sticks for $3.49 a pound (sale price) but they are also somewhat salty (not near as salty as the H/S sticks). If you want less salty without a strong honeysweet flavor, the HR are a good choice.";neutral

First of all, I didn't have the previous hydrox cookies before, so no real comparison there. BUT, I have been a real fan of oreo and wondering how can a ""better taste"" be. I have to say, it is really a bit disappointment, considering the price. 1. It is not much less sweet but rather a less potent chocolate flavor. 2. the cream part is terrible (although oreo didn't do much better either). I just feel confused why a ""just-simply-good"" cream can be that difficult to make??? Other than straight sweet and gritty texture, there is really nothing else.

Most flavors are delicious and have a nice aroma. The medium and bold coffees have a good kick, both in caffeine content and flavor. The only thing that brought my review down is that both the light roast cups included (the Wakey Wakey and the Vanilla Dream) are quite bland, yet that may just be due to my tastes. Still, this is definitely a good value and number of cups for the money spent. Will be buying again.;neutral

"I was really disappointed to find that sugar was a predominant ingredient. Blue Diamond seems anxious to hide this fact, since it rather misleadingly lists it as ""evaporated cane juice"". Hint: white sugar is white sugar. Just call it what it is or leave it out. One serving of this has 6g of sugar, roughly one and a half teaspoons of white sugar per cup.

On the plus side, it uses sunflower lecithin instead of soy lecithin. But why does an alleged ""all natural"" product even need to use emulsifiers, thickeners, and other such additives? Real almond milk would naturally be gluten free, soy free, AND sugar free.

I don't know what's happened to curry powders in the last few years.  Mainly they just smell/taste like celery powder now.  I guess celery powder is pretty cheap compared to other spices.  I think I will have to start making my own - something I did once years ago - and while it was delicious it wasn't super convenient.  On the plus side, if you like the now-typical curry powder that is predominantly this celery flavor, this is a large jar of it at a price lower than you're likely to find elsewhere and it arrived quickly.;neutral

"the pros: non gmo corn. this speaks for itself. the package is not made up of chemically enhanced materials. the butter and sea salt powder contains no additives.
the cons: there are significant unpopped kernels left in the bag after popping. one adds a tbls of oil to the bag before adding the butter powder.
one has to really shake the bag after adding the oil to coat the popped corn so the powder will stick. then one has to shake the bag vigorously a second time after adding the powder to complete the process before enjoying the product.
Conclusion: the concept behind this product is sound and a good attempt has been made to create a microwavable popcorn free from the harmful processes and added chemicals employed by the major manufacturers.  However, the method utilized by this company is cumbersome and awkward. I also question why additional oil has to be introduced into the product to create a medium for the butter powder to stick. The finished product is tasty, however that is not enough to offset the overall awkwardness of the process.
 It is for these reasons I give this Product only 3 stars out of 5.  I encourage Quinn's to continue to refine their process as they have a good first effort...";neutral

"I LOVE caramel popcorn and have tried many different varieties and flavors.  This looked like a super easy way to make it so I ordered.

The glaze does a pretty good job of fully coating the first kernels popped but then gets really light on the remaining pot of corn.

I was not a fan of this detox tea. I have used Skinny Fox Detox in the past (2 times) and loved it. Their customer service was outstanding and I had not bad side effects. With this detox, I cannot say the same. I ordered this detox because I was in a time crunch and thought I'd try something new. The tea arrived promptly and had the same appearance, taste and smell of the other detox I did previously. The morning tea gave me lots of enegry, which I loved. Unfortunately, the side effects were unbearable. The first week I had horrible diarrhea every morning multiple times despite following the guidelines for the evening colon tea. I even tried adjusting the steep time as suggested, which helped some, but the stomach pain continued. The bloating and gasy pain was awful. I followed a completely clean diet as well as drinking 60+ oz of water per day. I had to return this tea after a week and a half and I am going back to my tried and true detox tea by SkinnyFox Detox.;neutral

I bought this as a gift for someone and am a little disappointed in the size. It looks a bit bigger in the photograph. The nuts aren't exactly to scale and are obviously photoshopped in. In the actual packaging, the nuts are packaged inside in clear plastic bags to prevent the nuts from rolling around and getting into separate trays but it definitely detracts from the aesthetic value a little bit. The outer box is in good shape and not damaged or banged up at all. I can't speak for the taste as I haven't given it to the recipient yet. The assortment choice is nice but in the end I feel like I am giving a cheap looking gift box.;neutral

"Jamaica Me Crazy is a sweet, coconut flavored coffee that has a mild aftertaste.  It is not a bold blend, but rather a mild to medium blend that leans more mild.

This is certainly not a first cup of morning coffee for die-hard coffee drinkers who lean towards the medium to bold blends.  I would consider it a second cup of morning coffee, afternoon pick me up coffee or a dessert coffee.

Flavor is OK.  I would like it better if the aftertaste didn't linger.  For a flavored coffee, it isn't bad & if you are a coconut fan, it is a blend to try on for size.";neutral

Not as great as other reviewers claim in my opinion.  This chocolate tastes OK but it is not stellar. To date I haven't found a cake up hot chocolate that is stellar. They all taste slightly insipid and lack that old time hot chocolate with mother and daddy taste.  The level of insipidness varies by brand.  I cant say that Grove Square hot cocoa is any better than SwissMiss. Maybe its the batch I received but based on others reviews  I was expecting a deeper richer taste experience.;neutral

For a T-Bone steak I was surprised. This steak was only 1/2 inch thick. The flavor was alright. Having raised Black Angus, I know how delicious they meat.

Let me say I have had much better steaks.;neutral

I love having grass fed beef sticks to grab on the go. These however I really didn't like. They are so fatty tasting it left a film in my mouth and the texture is a bit mushy from the fat content. Hey, some people love this rich taste and texture. It's just not for me.;neutral

These are okay-ish.  I can eat them but they aren't yummy enough for what they are.  A little dry and crumbly, a little salty.  Usually my kids love cereal bars such as this (they have only ever had organic and natural brands), and we go through them very quickly.  One of them likes these well enough but the others don't at all.  Since I bought six boxes it will take us quite a while to eat all of these.;neutral
"I've been trying this coffee for some time now and was shocked when I saw this was actually a blend of coffee beans based on the variance in poor roasting qualities. The photos clearly shows how bad the quality control of their roasting actually is. You'll see a mix of lightly roasted and some to the point of almost burnt. Clearly they mixed a bad batch of roasted beans and it certainly was intentional. This is something you don't miss.
Was the coffee bad? Not really, but would classify as a blend and not Italian roast. I still got a decent espresso extract and may try them again in the future assuming that future purchases won't be a coffee blend and an evenly roasted bean.";neutral
"Considering I give all other instant a 1, 3 is pretty good.
It's ok instant coffee. It's not great. It still has that instant twang, but it's closer to brewed coffee due to the micro grind (which leaves a tiny bit of silt akin to french press, but less). I've roasted coffee for better than 9 years now, so making a concession to carry instant is a big deal. I rarely roast over city/city+, so I find the Veranda is the only one that's drinkable. For hiking & motorcycling the need for space wins out, but I would never buy this for day to day or car camping.

For long trips, this is an ok compromise to carry my morning and afternoon habit. For shorter trips, I still carry beans, small grinder, and a collapsible brewer. 1 week out is the tipping point where fresh coffee has to give way to instant to make room for food and other stuff.";neutral
"Interesting that the reviews are so mixed.  Some people seem to love this fudge.  I thought it was terrible.  My wife thought it was mediocre and my receptionist liked it.  I thought it had a flavor like spoiled milk and a mildly gritty texture.  Definitely not creamy or smooth.  I wonder if some people cannot taste what I am describing as spoiled milk.  If that flavor were not present, this would be okay fudge.

Update:  My receptionist said this is a 4 star fudge and said that her friend also liked it.  So maybe I have weird taste...I updated the star rating to 3 to try to average it all out.";neutral
Because I really love red rooibos, I decided to try the green variant as well (after all, I do prefer green teas to black teas).  But I was disappointed with this infusion, which was somewhat pale and tasteless compared to the Davidson's red rooibos that I bought from Amazon in the same order as a test.  Even so, the green rooibos does make a nice base to try adding other, more pungent herbal teas, and the price was so reasonable that experimentation is easy to justify.  I suspect that the processing, not the underlying botanical product, is why this variant seemed bland to me, but everyone has his or her own tastes, of course, and you might conclude otherwise.  What's clear, though, is that if you know and like green rooibos, you just can't beat the Davidson's price on Amazon.;neutral
"First, after being VERY skeptical, I AM A BELIEVER IN MANUKA HONEY!!  I bought 4 brands of manuka honey after doing MUCH research.  I was trying to find honey to heal my wounds (I'm diabetic for 35+ years and take Enbrel for arthritis.. don't heal as well as most!).. This honey was very thin and darker in color.  It could have just been the batch, but I tried the Manuka Honey 100% Pure by Manuka Health - MUCH better, thicker and lighter in color, which is most ideal for wound healing.. see my review there.

I have decided to eat this honey.. If the honey heals my outside wounds as amazing as it did, I can only imagine what is does on the inside!! It is sweet to the taste, not like regular honey, but easy to eat. 2-3 times a day, a tablespoon - but don't eat or drink 20 min. before OR after so you get the full power of it. I would not recommend for wound healing..

Like another reviewer, I did not like the addition of licorice to the chamomile.

The almond butter is good.  I did not know that the flax seeds included in the mix were not ground.  It's whole seeds.  That's maddening.  Those will get between my teeth and gums, and they are hard to dislodge.  I'd buy more if it were not for that.;neutral
"I've cooked different types of rice for years. I've had some difficulties with their outcome but on the whole, results have been good. Brown rice has never worked.

For some reason, Biscoff Spread started appearing on different websites. Pinterest has pages of Biscoff recipes.  And, it became the 'trendy item' of the moment. So, I ordered some from amazon to see what the furor is about, and to see if it is as delicious as so many people claim. My opinion of Biscoff is that it is 'okay.'  I wouldn't buy another jar--in fact, only a few teaspoons of the spread have been used.  I don't see the appeal. It's a European cookie spread, meaning that the spread is made (primarily, I guess) from Biscoff cookies and probably a lot of sugar.  The taste isn't distinctive, in fact, it is sort of bland.  To use it in recipes (I think I saw a Biscoff fudge on one site) you would have to add lots of sugar and maybe even cream to produce a Biscoff fudge or candy.  Maybe Biscoff is like peanut butter.  It's easy to spread. You can make sandwiches out of it, and then use it for other goodies.  I just don't see the need, and will never spend my money on such an expensive product, when we already have plenty of others on our supermarket shelves.;neutral

I'm a bit older and began to experience severe hyper sensitivity with my teeth.  I believe it was due to the acidity of this product.  Some research on the net confirmed that high acid stuff is not all that great for you teeth (erodes the enamel) and an email to the manufacturer confirmed the high acidity of this product. After stopping it's use and within a relatively short period of time my sensitivity abated.

It doesn't ever thicken and separate and yet it has weird grainy bits in it that never seem to blend smoothly. I bought this since my regular 'clean' brand (no additives) is unavailable locally.

Note- you may have to use a lot since it's so watered down.;neutral
To be honest, I needed to fill out a $25 order for free shipping so I added this item.  It was the best value for microwave popcorn at Amazon.  They charge less for it because it has less artificial flavoring (i.e. butter) I guess.  The popcorn is OK and up to their quality standards, but if you are going to splurge, you might as well go all the way with 'movie theatre' or 'extra butter' types.  They taste much more like the movies and only have a fraction more calories.  For the calorie conscious, you must (gasp) eat air popped with an air pop machine.  Then, you are really saving fat, salt and calories.;neutral
I can't seem to find this in any store, so I buy it from Amazon.  The product is great, but I dislike having to purchase such a large quantity.  I don't have a lot of pantry space, so 6 containers is a bit much.  I hope it doesn't go bad.;neutral
"I thought these were ok.. it's between 3 and 4 stars so I rounded up because I only had 2 other comparison points--

1) from nuts.com
2) FoodToLive brand from ebay.com/their website

I didn't like the one from nuts.com, they were really dry and almost hard to eat. Between Anthony's and FoodToLive I gotta say the latter is nicer. Here's the full methodology and analysis:

Comparing provenance: both bags say the berries are Turkish by nationality, and possess USDA organic certification (although.. ok let's not get political). The third-party certifier for Anthony's is CCOF, while the certifier for FoodToLive is A Bee Organic. I know nothing about these two food auditing groups, and therefore cannot comment on their veracity.

I took a random sample of a small handful of mulberries from each bag and laid them side by side on a piece of paper. While not a particularly robust sampling method, I think it's ok. I trust my fingers to be able to grab what feels like a representative sample of the population.  For reference, I placed their respective bags below. Please refer to picture 1 (there is really only one photo). Clearly, not a blind taste test, but I'm impartial and don't hold any prior biases, so that should negate some concerns with internal validity.

Visually inspecting the samples, the mulberries from Anthony's are darker and look more shrivelled, maybe more hunched-back and almost evil-looking compared to its competitor. Obvi, not a professional food tester here, but i think you'd know what I mean. That may be due to some burst fruit segments. In comparison, FoodToLive's berries were all in-tact. Size-wise though, there wasn't a drastic difference. The whole berries from FoodToLive seem to be bigger, and this test is a little biased because I've had the FoodToLive bag for a while and have squashed/ thrown it around, thereby reducing the integrity of the berries' whole-ness.

For the taste test, I went back and forth between the two brands, drinking pure, room temperature water every now and then to artificially recreate a neutral starting point. I also randomized the order of the sampling-- Anthony's before FoodToLive and vice versa.

Taste-wise, Anthony's has more of a brown sugar flavor, while FoodToLive has more of a white-sugar kind of hit. Both are sweet. Definitely sweet. I like both, but there's something about that POW from white sugar that makes me go, OOH! Like a wild sugar rush. I mean, sometimes when you're eating something good for you, it's nice to feel like it's actually something naughty. I did feel as though some pieces of mulberry from Anthony's had a bit of a huskier, mustier flavor to it. If you've ever had ripe, raw mulberries, it was as if some of them were ovverripe when picked and dried.

I like the mouth feel of being able to break each mulberry down to the individual segments with my tongue, it's like playing with my food. Was able to do this with each of FoodToLive's berries, but with only some of Anthony's berries. I mean, ultimately berries from both brands turn into a sticky mush when chewing, but it's nice to have a different texture. Could be just me. Probably just me. Also, FoodToLive's berries start out feeling confidently dry, and then when you chew, it's like you break into the rich, soft, tender part of the berry. Quite an experience. Anthony's on the other hand, was one dimensional. Just, dry+moist+soft+hard all all the same time. If i had to explain this difference in another way, it's like, watching a casting between a good and bad actor for the same part. You just become fascinated with one and don't really want to pay attention to the other.

Cost-wise, FoodToLive's berries run at $11.50/lb, while Anthony's are about $9/lb? FoodtoLive is also out of stock on their dried mulberries, which was the reason why I purchased Anthony's. I put myself on their mailing list because i'm pretty sure i'm buying theirs from now on.

For that price difference, I'd pay for FoodToLive. But, eh, these are ok.";neutral

Lids do not seal off water going into the pod.  Therefore it leaks around the top and down the side of the pod which misses the cup and clean up is necessary.  Some do okay but in my case it is about 50/50.  The center of lid I believe is to far down away from the seal which allows it to leak.  In all fairness sometimes it is the fault of the filter glues to the inside of the pod that won't let the lids fit well. I have tried rubber O rings to help with the gap but that does not seam to work.  All in all the best is still the original pod with foil seal.  Search still goes on to be able to make my own coffee to save money.  The best option are for the K-Cup makers to lower their profit margins so the pods are more reasonably prices.  If they did they would get more people to switch to their makers and the pod route. And they will make it up in volume.;neutral
I make 2-3 loaves of bread a week.  Some members of my family prefer a healthy wheat bread as opposed to the white flour breads so I bought this Honey Whole Wheat mix.  Each time I make this bread, it doesn't raise nice like my other breads do.  I only use the bread machine for the dough mixing and raising part of the prep.  I then remove the dough punch it down and place it in a 9 x 5 bread pan so that I get a nice loaf shape rather than the crazy loaf that bakes in the machine pan.  Anyway, I have made 6 loaves and just can't get this bread to raise as nice as others.;neutral
I love McDougall's products but this one is not very flavorful and certainly not spicy. It wasn't awful, just not memorable.

This causes the powder to clump up and if you're making a protein shake with it, vigorous shaking in a blender bottle STILL doesn't get rid of those clumps.

I have enjoyed others more such as bonito brand from Spain - that is much mores costly however.

I have to agree with some of the other reviews.  I don't like the taste.  This was recommended to me by my Dermotologist.  I can't seem to remember to take it.  Maybe because of the taste.

It's okay, but I don't think I'll get it again. Sadly, there were so many positive reviews, I went ahead and bought the six bag package. So I'll be eating this for a while. When it's done, though, I think for me, that'll be it.

There are obviously many, many people who love this popcorn. I just don't happen to be one of them, but at the end of the day, it's solely a personal preference.

It's a super idea, but for me the execution isn't what it could be.";neutral
"One reviewer called the olives ""mushy"". Yes, some are - too many are. The reason is: they are pitted. Pitted olives get mushy and loose their taste quickly. I tried to get unpitted olives. Impossible. ""Convenience"" is more important than taste, apparently. Yet, compared to the pitted Costco Kalamata olives, these are better in quality. But not excellent, just so so. What can you expect of pitted olives? They will always remain an inferior product.";neutral
I haven't had this soup in over a year but it seems they changed the recipe.  The meat balls are now like tiny bits of ground beef.  The seaoning also seems to have been toned down (too much).  It's a good soup but it used to be a great soup.;neutral
"I was not particularly impressed with these cups. However I can give some tips. A courser grind is better than a fine ground as a fine grind restricts flow through the screen. Also do not over pack the filter. The grinds should not be packed at all with a little space left for expansion.
I think a better alternative is a ""Finum Brewing Basket"" found on Amazon.
I simply put my coffee in the Finum brewing filter, place it in my cup, put my cup under the Keurig machine and let er rip. Then when it comes out I let it set for a moment or two and take a spoon and swirl the grinds as I lift the filter out of my cup. I end up with a perfect cup with crema on the top. Frankly this makes a better cup of coffee than the Keurig K-cups, or the reusable filters that are placed in the Keurig machine, or a French press. It also allows you to control the grind, the type of coffee you buy, the amount of coffee used per cup, and the length of time in contact with the water; all components of a perfect cup.
Simply put I love my Keurig machine without the k-cups but with the Finum filters.";neutral
I loved the idea that cashews that are salt-free could be roasted. However, I did not realize that roasting would make a difference in taste. I would not recommend these to those who care about taste. They might be OK as a baking or cooking cashew. I bought them to snack on.  I am not planning to buy any more.;neutral
OK but not like homemade;neutral
"It was a large bottle so that was good.

The taste was OK, but I expected better from all the rave reviews.

Use it sparingly, it is potent and salty!

When I removed the bottle's cap, the bottle was wide open -- no seal, which is unheard of in this day and age. Was it a return that they just shipped out to me? At any rate, it could have been contaminated. I poured off some from the top and used the lower contents.

I would like to know if other buyers got theirs without a seal.";neutral
My first experience with Annie Chun's Noodle Bowls was the Kimchi.  It is awesome. I highly recommend that one. Recently Annie Chun products were on sale so I bought the Miso as Amazon was out of Kimchi.  I love Miso so I figured it would be as good as the Kimchi only not spicy.  Wrong.  I've had Kikkoman instant miso soup before and it has a better miso flavor. And I ate it plain.  I added spinach, tofu and a a touch of sliced mushrooms to Annie's and it still was just ok. It does have the noodles though--they're fun.  But my opinion is that if you like miso you will find this lacking.  I will not be purchasing this one again.;neutral
The chips were very tasty. If I was rating just the flavor I would give that a 5. I was excited to have a snack that I actually didn't have to prepare. However my chips were packed in an envelope enclosed with tiny chip crumbs. Very disappointing and that is why I give it a 3. I expected better packaging for the price paid. ;neutral
Meh... Based on reviews I had very high expectations but to me it tastes like unflavored coffee. Don't know if I'm brewing it wrong, I get a bit of cinnamon but absolutely no chipotle or chocolate. It's also dark roast, I didn't see that when I purchased it so it's very strong.;neutral
I had high hopes for these power wraps - what could be better?  High protein, organic, vegetarian.  The problem was that I found the taste just okay, and the longer I ate them, the less I liked the okay taste.  I love nori, so it wasn't that taste that turned me off.  That said, the nori tends to stick to your teeth.  I really wanted to like these...;neutral
"I buy and try many different coffee brands in addition to what I buy locally from roaster.  Opening the bag, my initial observation was that the beans smelled a little overcooked.  Not bad, just faintly burnt.  The flavor is strong and bold with Chocolaty overtones.  Less fruity brightness than some.  I didn't notice the claimed high caffeine content, but I also sometimes drink straight Robusta beans, that are super high in caffeine compared to Arabica.  I typically brew a double espresso in the morning (2oz) from about 19gr of coffee ground with a conical burr grinder.  The Death Wish is a strong, bold coffee, certain to retain it's flavor for coffee drinks such as Latte and Cappuccino.
I just tried my first cup today, and need to adjust my grinder and tamping to reach an optimal pull.  As for brute Caffeine punch, I think that 100% Robusta coffee may take the prize.  A 2oz cup of Robusta espresso brew tends to make my hands shake a little.  A second cup may cause heart palpitations ;-)  I'll post a follow-up once I have this dialed in for my espresso maker.";neutral
Not to my taste, but good price.;neutral
I like them ...they're chocolate but....there was no melting going on.  I ordered these to give away.  I was so excited mine weren't melted they looked good but when I tried one I was disappointed .  The Lindt advertising says they will melt upon cracking the shell.  I called Lindt to see why this would happen and was told that each Lindt package has an expiration date and that they should not get hot.  The rep told me they should be creamy in the center.  Hmmm I will be ordering directly from Lindtusa for my Christmas gifts.  I did so yesterday and there was a special for truffles going on THIS weekend.  I asked the co. rep if cold will affect the melting and was told it will not.  I really want to give two stars but they tasted good so will leave it at three but feel I got sold bad product that is not as it should be : (;neutral
"I LOVE Ghirardelli chocolate but this one just wasn't what I expected.
It had a somewhat odd taste, definitely not what I'm used to in
their milk chocolate.  Maybe it's because there's more milk in it to
make it extra creamy (which it was).  Just not for me.  I wouldn't
buy this variety again.";neutral
I wish I could give this more than 3 stars because I do believe that it is a good product.  However, it didn't work for me texture-wise.  I was willing to try it and wished I liked it because it is more healthy than wheat pasta I do believe.  But I'm too old to be converted I guess.  I can say nothing bad about it except it is not for me.  It takes on the flavor of whatever sauce used and that's a good thing but the texture is different and heavier.  Of course, it would be heavier being made of black beans which I do like in bean form.  :)  If that would be no problem for you, then give it a try.  Always good to give things a try at the very least.;neutral
I was unenthused by this selection. With few exceptions, this was bland and boring with some veering to awful and a few to palatable. I just want a multi pack of GOOD K Cups.

The cookes are excellent, however, having ordered I proceeded to finish one bax, opening the othetr more thn half the  shortbreads were in crumbles.  The item is listed as non-returnable, well then I'm stuck with $15 to 18.00 worht of shortbread crumbs?;neutral
Being a Twinings fan, I came across this tea by accident and decided its a 'must try'. It has undertones of spice and lemon, if that's what you like, a little too zesty for me, and so Im not a huge fan.

"They call it stick gum, but it's actually little bricks. Once package is opened, it's ruined and will not keep gum blocks together. I was expecting gum ""sticks,"" -- you know, thin, 1/2 inch wide 3 or 4 inches long, in a package that keeps all the gum together in one place.";neutral
"It tastes OK!  But not as flavorful as Trader Joe's ""organic"" greek olive oil which is actually a little bit cheaper than Partanna's.  The reason I only give it 3 stars is because it didn't pass the authentic olive oil test.  I suspect it has been cut with some other oil, but I have no solid proof.  I was told that real 100% olive oil will thicken a bit and cloud up when it is put in the refrigerator.  Partanna stays clear and does not thicken at all. I won't be ordering it in the future.";neutral
I prefer Matlow's Cry mints. These seem nearly identical in shape to the Matlow's, but the taste of these mints is milder and less interesting than Matlows. It's somewhat subtle and at first I wasn't sure there was any difference, but after eating quite a few I kind of regret buying such a large package. They're not bad and if I hadn't tried Matlow's first I would be happy enough with these.;neutral
"The gumball itself (after the first two minutes of chewing) was sweet and just like your regular old, run-of-the-mill gumball.  The initial spice was very underwhelming.  I bought these for a coworker who complains that other cinnamon candies are not spicy enough, and I had (affectionately) wanted to give him something that would burn the fire out of his mouth.  Ghost peppers are supposed to be one of the hottest peppers in the world, but this was only barely ""warm"".  I really question how much actual ghost pepper is used.  I'm a real spice wimp--I frequently can't eat salsa in a mexican restaurant--but I was able to eat one of these.  That's pathetic.

So short story: flavorful, but not challenging.";neutral
"Well, wanting to try new and additional ""healthy"" items.  People really like this stuff, and the product itself is not bad and well packaged.

The only good thing I have found this for is lotion.  Using it by itself or with other items(like Shea) is good.";neutral
You have to be careful with these things.  I've followed others' instructions (use a paper plate, etc.) as best I could, but I always end up with some hard--and I mean HARD--pieces in rinds.  Examine the ones you're going to eat and be careful--you'll break your teeth on these if they weren't cooked all the way.  I still make them at work once in a while, but I'm a little skittish as I've really crunched hard on pieces at times.  Use caution.;neutral
"Update:

The company reached out to me and made things right. Outstanding customer service and giving an extra 2 stars

------------------

I had high hopes of trying out this product so I didn't have to buy so much flavored water at work but I was sorely disappointed.

The bottles have hardly anything in them. This becomes apparent when you have to use one squirt per 8oz of water. One bottle will only last a very short time if you are filling up a 1L water bottle and having to add 4 squirts each time.

The flavor tastes artificial and has a bad aftertaste. There is no natural taste from these at all, only a sweet synthetic taste. Very disappointing.

These are EXPENSIVE! I paid $20 plus tax for these due to all of the good reviews but I can't help feel like I have been ripped off. At most these should be priced at $2 per bottle, not $4! I feel like the price is far too high for what you actually get.

They claim to make 100 drinks but any bottle of cordial will easily make 100 drinks if I am using one squirt per 8oz and will cost a fraction of the price.

To top it off these are not eligible for return. I am sorely disappointed with these and I would like a refund.";neutral

I forgot why I had held off on buying this stuff for so long. I figured it was because I didn't trust myself to combine my love for candy and caffeine, because what if I overdid it? No, I remembered after I bought the pack that I hate all forms of fake-sugar, and this stuff is loaded with regular AND fake sugar to cover for the caffeine taste... if you're used to the bitterness of caffeine, this ain't bad, but plenty of my co-workers couldn't handle it. My cousin loves the stuff, since he drives a truck and it keeps him alert when the fatigue starts setting in, but altogether I've found that they don't quite conquer my tolerance. I did what I read in another review (and this is why I bought it) and started chewing a peice each morning when I hit the snooze alarm, but honestly, with my tolerance I could've went back to sleep, and sometimes felt like the only thing stopping me was fear of choking on gum. However, it did cement my reputation as a caffeine-connoseur.;neutral

Let me start by saying the seller shipped fast sent free info and a free caramel match a sample which was very kind. Shipping cost was overpriced and it came in a plain black bag not the bag advertised so those are the only two reasons I didn't give it a 5_the quality and quantity is great! The bag is big and the tea is ssstttronnng so literally 1 tsp per cup is all  you need. I added 1 tbs and it was too much. It is hard to find match a powder especially 8 oz bags for this price****UPDATE*** I'm changing my rating to 3.5 stars. After doing some research good match should be *bright* green this is dull green and tastes very bitter despite sugar though most strong tea has a bitterness. It is tolerable. I think I'm going to try to find another brand, preferably one that is pre-sweetened;neutral

Well, what can you say about Campbell's tomato soup? Kind of sweet, not very interesting, but pretty good. My main issue with these has been stated in other reviews.

Though no comparison to ""real"" coffee, when you need a coffee fix, they are a viable option.  Unlike the instant Nescafe packets and Folgers, these actually taste about 80% of a regular fresh brewed Starbucks coffee and don't have any weird artifical aftertaste.

They are best when piping hot, as they do lose flavor once they start cooling and the bottom of the cup will have some weird fine-sludge of undissolved powder.

A spoon and a jar of Skippy is a fave in terms of that little something to help you make it to dinner in our house.  We all have our own jar because we each have our own preference.

This is so subjective it isn't fair to post a review.  We are doing a ginger ale taste test and Q we really disliked. No sweetness. Way too dry. No bite. Tastes like water with lots of ginger.

"I don't know... This chocolate bar was good, and it was cool to be able to get an imported treat so easily from Amazon. We definitely didn't have the same problems others did. We ordered directly from Amazon, which cost a little more, but our order came quickly, and the chocolate was fresh. It tastes very good though it isn't any better than other imported chocolates (such as Milka) readily available at the local grocery store.

Others have extolled the virtues of this bar, and I've seen a few of those infamously sensual Flake commercials on YouTube. That's pretty funny because no one will look sexy while eating this chocolate. It is messy! The commercials rave about how the chocolate is flaky. How right they are; you'll have flakes all over your shirt. Those tiny flakes, as you can imagine, melt very easily, so when you try to clean them off of you, the chocolate just smudges.

These would be 100x more awesome if they used real vanilla flavoring instead of vanillin or just had a plain cream flavor you could add your own flavoring to. 1 in 3 people can taste the difference vanilla vs vanillin, and most people dislike the artificial aftertaste of vanillin.

Citric acid is citric acid, so this works just fine for citric acid and is a good price.

I got these for the kids after-school snacks.  And once I opened the package and saw how teeny tiny these are... I realized I should have gotten 2 boxes to last us.  If you're on a diet and can do just one bar... I have to say, these are so tasty.  But if you're looking for a take along snack for a child who is older than about 3 years old, plan on doling out 2-4 of these per kid.;neutral
Ok, to much sugar.;neutral
I agree that Davidson loose tea is much better.  I like the taste of this one but it takes so many bags in my iced tea maker to produce a decent strength of tea that it is not economical.  Will try it the old fashioned steeping way and see what happens!  It does have a lovely flavor though.;neutral
When I ordered these bottles I expected to get 3 water drinking bottles I could carry around with me. I had no idea that I was buying Artesian sparkling water. The water is good though. The bottles are very heavy which is nice if you keep it on top of a desk or kitchen but it's kind of heavy to carry it around. Oh well.;neutral
"The concept of these suckers are great; the follow through of concept, no so much.  Like others have stated, these arrived melted, very sticky, and immediately fell off of stick just trying to remove wrapper.  Removing the wrapper was not easy, and quite messy.  My kids liked the flavors, and I appreciate some different flavors from the usual.  For example, the yellow sucker was not lemon, but instead pineapple.  Pineapple was a nice surprise.  I, as a parent, appreciate the concept of giving my children a treat that is actually good for them.  Maybe the recipe needs to be re-done, or allow cooking longer for a true hard crack.  Perhaps it was the mixture of sweeteners used.  I really liked the fact that these were thought up by a kid.  I hope the recipe is redone for better result, or made as a lozenge instead.  We will buy these in the future if change occurs for the better.  Meaning, a hard sucker rather than taffy consistency.  And just a trick we did to make it easier if you do get a sticky pack, place the pack in the freezer.  Keep frozen until use.  This way, the sticky mess is kept to a minimum, and you can actually get the wrapper off without pulling out the stick.";neutral
Yummy stuff. Overpriced.;neutral
I love this brand and the various pastas.  The taste of this one is great but I found that no matter how you cook them the filling never becomes entirely soft.  Cook them too long and the pasta falls apart.....and you'll still be left with a hard filling.;neutral
This is an excellent product, if you like the bit of very hot peppers in the 5-pepper mix. I had not tried it before, so gave it a shot. When it's gone, I'll switch back to the 3-pepper blend I have used before, as I'm not fond of very hot peppers, but other who have tried it love it. All depends on your preference.;neutral
I haven't tried these yet, but will update this review when I do. They arrived promptly as described, though a few cans were dented. This is the third case of veggies I've ordered from Amazon and all have arrived somewhat damaged. Amazon needs to be careful what they're receiving and how they are sending things out.;neutral

"Like many other people who have posted reviews of Ethical Coffee Company's capsules that are compatible with Nespresso brewers, I was excited to be offered an alternative to Nespresso's own capsules.  I have already written reviews of the Espresso and Decaf capsules from ECC, and I intend to write a review for their Indiad'oro variety as well.

As to this Cremoso variety, I have to say that I preferred it to the Espresso variety at first because it seemed more interesting even though it was a bit less strong, but after having consumed about 25 capsules I must say that the Cremoso flavor is quite underwhelming.  It doesn't taste bad, but it simply doesn't have much flavor at all.  Even at the current, significantly reduced price -- exactly half the price of most Nespresso capsules available direct from the Nespresso club, I don't think I would order the Cremoso variety again.  It's just WAY too mild for my liking.";neutral
A little minty and very dry, but good for mixed use. You can't beat the price. Remove from the mylar wrapping asap and let it breathe. I suggest then putting it into glass bottles and jars, (there's a LOT of this stuff!);neutral
This review is not based on the taste or quality of the product - it is based on the condition it was in when I received it - it was totally melted & is no longer in the 'chip' form. Paying $11.95 for 'chips' is what I expect - not some totally melted, runny mess. I have ordered other brands of chocolate chips & they were very astute knowing the chips may melt in transit & took a wrap-around icepack to preserve the chips from melting. I offer this as a suggestion to you, otherwise, I will not be ordering this product again. As my product is now in the freezer waiting for me to break it into the little chips I wanted to put on my organic pancakes, I cannot give a review of anything else, nor do I wish to. Thank you.;neutral
Love the concept, but the wraps are so MICRO-thin and sometimes brittle that they are sometimes hard to peel off the interspersed paper protectors without breaking.  Not very practical for wraps.  Most of them broke.  And some of them were completely unusable.  I love that they are organic coconut and I bought the 49-count pack to save money, but it wasn't really worth it.  Probably wouldn't buy again.;neutral
Even though I knew this was a blend and not 100% Kona, I was still a little disappointed by it (even taking into account my lowered expectations). It is a decent enough coffee, but doesn't really have that smooth Kona flavor that I fell in love with in Hawaii. Honestly, I'd rather just have 100% Kona every once in a while and regular coffee the rest of the time than drink this.;neutral
This is just ok for me. I like about 3 flavors from the package, but the rest just don't taste nice to me. I am actually just working through it so I can go get another box of something else. Crazy Cups just tends to be a weird one for me. I've tried other packs of coffee of them and it's usually I like some but not all the flavors. This one, sadly, had less flavors to like for me. I don't really get chocolate from these coffees, I get the other flavors mixed in, sometimes. Perhaps it was just me, but this just wasn't a great purchase for me.;neutral
"These cookies were delivered on time and the package was as described.
We usually buy these cookies from a discount warehouse store but they ran out.  The package from the discounter is slightly different from the Amazon.com supplier but the cookies are the same.

It is more expensive to buy these cookies on-line than to buy them in the store.  Nevertheless my son enjoys the cookies and we are satisfied.";neutral
These are OK, but the bar is super thin and hard like a granola bar.  The taste is OK but they are hard as can be to chew.  Maybe mine were stale, not sure.  I like them, but wish they were softer and fresher.;neutral
I was excited to try these because of the variety of flavors.  I've tried several so far with mixed results.  The Birthday Cake was scrumptious, but I don't know about the others.  With some of the flavors, the first bite tastes exactly like the name, but gradually the taste gets weirder and weirder.  Not sure what it is, but the aftertaste is just awful.  Same thing with the texture. The Birthday Cake actually tastes like cake.  The others have a strange texture.  Probably won't buy these again.;neutral

"Ouch !! I ordered Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, But I got Double Dark Chocolate, bummer. It taste just ok, but now I am stuck with 20 bars. Just too much chocolate.

Great Product just received wrong flavor.";neutral
"This may be the most popular tea in Ireland; however, it didn't make the grade in our household.  We ended up donating the box with 78 tea bags to the church larder.  If you want an ordinary tea, Lipton's is just as good.";neutral

Nothing wrong with the product, it was great and exactly what I needed. However, the price is a whole lot higher. If you go to Kroger you can buy this for almost half the price. If it were on sale and under five dollars though, I would order this again.;neutral
I have no complaints about this product but thwere is no real fiber type taste,  I eat oat meal during the winter.  I wanted a true organic oatmeal abd this is.  So I get good nutrition.

I'm rating this item a 3.  The taste is okay.  I ordered a case of them, and when they arrived, all the packets were very old looking, roughed up.  One of them had been busted open they were sitting so long in storage, and beef stew powder got all over my entire order.  I don't really know if that was due to the manufacturer or from Amazon.  I'd keep this in mind if you're considering ordering by the case.;neutral
I really like the idea of these Stevia water enhancers....however, the bottles get clogged easily, and it becomes quite difficult to squeeze any of the remaining liquid after a very short time. This is a shame because at first when I was able to get some of the product into water, it has great potential. If someone is expecting a taste like one of the powdered or liquid water enhancers that contain another sugar substitute, you most likely will not like this flavor as much, as it is not sweet. Of course one has control over how much to add....if only you can solve the problem of these small bottles getting stopped up/blocked. I hear the liquid inside...but after even only one use, some of the bottles are completely clogged. And yes, I removed all the foil & cardboard circle seals. Hopefully this flaw can be fixed. The idea & the flavors have such potential.;neutral

"If you like the smell of rose essence, this will be so amazing for you. Get it! This company makes great teas, and this tea, I'm sure is wonderful for some.
However, for me, it smells like Gramma perfume and is overwhelming. I tried a sip and just totally hated it. It's just a personal preference. Honestly, for my taste personally, I'd give it 1 star, but Davidson's makes fantastic tea that I drink every day.

I am probably going to make sachets for my closet with it. I'll then smell like my gramma, but that's okay. :)

By the way, Davidson's Jasmine Green tea is AMAZING. It's so deliciously perfect. So if you like jasmine, check it out!";neutral
Weird flavor to it.;neutral
"This is like a Papa John's or ""fresco"" style pizza sauce.  It's not a smooth, bold, robust or hearty pizza sauce.  It also has a bit of a weird bitter aftertaste that may be from oregano, but it isn't as noticeable when cooked on a pizza and may actually work well with some topppings.  Now, I don't know if this is an indication of what pizza sauces were actually like over 60 years ago, but it may not be up to modern taste expectations, so just be aware of what you're getting.  I plan to use it as a replacement for seasoned tomato sauce in my own custom pizza sauce recipe (it is very hard to find seasoned tomato sauce without citric acid nowadays).";neutral
Love this beef jerky;neutral
A BIT TOO EXPENSIVE.;neutral
I like the powder, but I am only giving it three stars because what I do not like is that they did not disclose that there is rice concentrate in it. You can taste both, but it still has a good beet taste.  I would have rather paid a little more for a pure product.;neutral
I don't think I have eaten these in 15+ years?  Purchased them at a low price, and they are just like I remember them - take some peanuts and squash them up with a sort of caramel substance, press it all into a log shape, and there you go - that's it - no frills.  The caramel glue leaves something to be desired.  It's edible, you'll eat it over tossing them out, but it's just OK.  You never hear about this candy so someone must be eating them it they are still making them...  You can take your money and use it elsewhere.;neutral

"This taste of this product is fine (and better with a hint of honey in it), just not my FAVE tea.  I purchased it because I was looking for a green tea that I could regularly drink to help with inflammation, as in arthritis.  I had read what wonderful anti-oxidant properties that green tea has, and especially ""Gunpowder Green"".  However, I forgot to look for DECAFFEINATED tea.  I often enjoy a nice cup of tea at night.  But I won't be indulging in THIS caffeinated product in the evening near bedtime any time soon..";neutral
I'm not really thrilled with it.  The flavor would be good, but the sweetness overpowers it.  Much better if mixed with stone ground or brown mustard.  Bavarian mustard is sweet, but I was hoping for less sweetness/sugar.;neutral
It is true that this gives a lot of energy. I noticed the change in my mood after using this in my smoothies however I did notice I began to get a lot of pimples on my face. I am no doctor but having read up on this, I realize that it could be a consequence of probably too much protein in my diet so I suggest this be used in moderation. I have now stopped using it in my smoothies to see if there is a change in the pimples on my face hope that helps.;neutral
It has a unique taste. The sweetness from the apple kind of reminds me of a fruit roll-up. I would have liked to taste more of a vegetable than a fruit. Overall, it's different and something to consider if you want to use something other than bread.....;neutral
"First off I guess I thought based on the photo this was going to be a bigger bag but it is about the size of an open hand. Secondly, others have said they love these but to me, they taste like stale cereal.

Also I ordered 5 items all at once and 4 of them arrived in a few days but this item was shipped by itself and took about 8 days to arrive.
My 3 stars are based mostly on the texture and taste. Very off putting to me. If you like eating bland, stale tasting things, go for it.";neutral
"I found nothing wrong with the taste of the rice noodles. They were excellent. I was not impressed with the Spring Onion flavor:  it was weak, and I have decided to reorder my favorite taste of Ginger Thai Kitchen as soon as I finish the box of 12 of Spring Onion.

Rather than just plain water for these noodles, I used  only chicken broth made from my homemade Vietnamese chicken noodle soup. The broth is excellent and added to,the flavor of the Spring Onion soup. Still, I did not taste anything that might be considered spring onion. I recommend removing this flavor from the list until it has been improved;that is, up to standard. Some of the other flavors are to die for!

Do not trash the remaining packets, however, because there ARE ways to bring a pleasant noodle-soup taste to th remaining packets. Try adding a good-sized handful l of thawed, cooked and de shelled shrimp along with the broth you are using, or add some pieces of cooked chicken along with the broth. These preps take only an extra one or two minutes to include. ENJOY";neutral
"I bought this brand of French Vanilla creamer because it was cheaper than my usual brand (Coffee Mate French Vanilla Single Serve Creamers) but, I don't think I'll buy these again unless there's a significant difference in price. In comparison to the Coffee Mate (in my opinion) the French Vanilla flavor feels more artificial and has a very slight aftertaste....nothing too bothersome though. Overall, it is still a good creamer, I just prefer the Coffee Mate version. However, for the hazelnut flavor, I do prefer the International Delight version over all everything else.
As for the packaging, like the other reviewers, there seemed to have been a leak in one of the cups and so a few of them were sticky and had a crust-like thing on them. But for me, it wasn't a big mess (it really did seem like just ONE cup leaked) and so it wasn't a big deal for me.";neutral
Love the large bag, and the price is good. However the nuts are smaller and a little drier than the California variety.  Also about half as salty as we like for snacking. But given the price..... plus I  won't feel guilty using them for cooking and baking!;neutral
I'm a huge fan of Zevia sodas and blackberries so I was really excited to try this Blackberry Sparkling Water by Zevia.  I was hesitant to buy this as it's quite pricey, but because of my trust in the Zevia brand, I figured I didn't have anything to lose.  Sadly, this product just didn't tick all the boxes for me.  The flavor was so light I would hardly call it blackberry and the sweetness was barely there as well.  I understand this is a very lightly sweetened product so that part wasn't a surprise, but the lack of flavor made this taste like just lightly sweetened sparkling water, which evidently, I am not a fan of.  I think I'll stick to my favorite Zevia Cherry Cola instead.;neutral
"I love the concept. It has helped me control my caloric intake as it's pre-measured and easy to log accurate calories into a calorie tracker. There's no sugar crash as it is low GI carbs. Balanced fat and good protein as well. The texture and taste is as if you blended almond milk and oatmeal together. I also tried Nectar - I was excited for it after people mentioned it tastes like Fruity Pebbles milk. It tastes more like lemon cleaning product than any fruit I've had before - I wonder what kind of Fruity Pebbles those reviewers have tried :/

Bad news - I get horrible stomach cramps and loose stools. DO NOT try this away from a restroom. Going on a hike? Don't drink before hand. I've finished 2 cases (original and nectar) with same results. In about 10 minutes it's gurgle-fest and most of the time a quick restroom trip within 30.
I look forward to trying future versions. I have tried Ensure Enliven that has similar nutrition stats but doesn't carry the cool factor. They have better flavors and 50 calories less. No tummy issues.";neutral
"This has all the consistency, smell, and texture of peanut butter without all the fat.  It is light enough to spread on brownies for an amazing desert.  Really great for cooking.  However, it's not quite peanut butter.  If you're looking for a low-fat PBJ sandwich you might be disappointed.  I added much less water than what they call for.  It also helps to let it sit for 10-15 minutes after mixing.

Bottom line: give it a try.";neutral
Pretty tasteless, not really something I will ever use again. Instead, I recommend something healthy like a brown rice fettuccini noodle. Yes, you will have a few more calories, but they will be healthy ones and the taste is much, much better.;neutral
This chocolate syrup is okay, but I was hoping it would taste more like good quality chocolates. I would say it doesn't taste like chocolate at all. Perhaps I am just used to Hershey's chocolate syrup, but I am disappointed in this, and will look for something else next time. On the plus side, it does have a few less chemicals than Hershey's chocolate syrup, though it does have processed sugar, which isn't much better than the high fructose corn syrup in Hershey's, and two more grams of sugar. I am sorry I got four bottles of this stuff, and I would NOT recommend it.;neutral
"I love the tea, but do not love 2 bags stuck together that have to be carefully separated.  Several bags in each box had tea spilling out

I was somewhat surprised by this product. I didn't expect it to be so solid because all the raw honey I have gotten from locals has been in a quart jar with the pollen on top. Local meaning a person who has bees and harvests the honey. I had a time trying to figure out how to get it out of the jar. The taste is really good but it is harder to use for cooking and to use in tea than the other. I am sure whoever is used to honey in this form would be very happy with it but I prefer the liquid honey. In fact I had to google it to find out information about it because I have never seen honey in this form before. I will say everything I read in my search had only great things to say about it and how good it is for you.;neutral
Not that good;neutral
I generally like the bluesky cola product. I appreciate the fair pricing that is available on this site. I was ordering the organic version, which I, family and friends really enjoyed. Unfortunately, that product was discontinued so I ordered this product. The disappointing part was that it has a slight can flavor which indicates to me, that the product was old. How can one prevent that in the future.;neutral
I am clearly in the minority here because I didn't think this coffee tasted anything like the description.  I didn't get even a whiff of brown sugar at all.  Even after I added in splenda.  Oh well.  I'll just go back to Crazy Cups.  Their coffee is always amazing.;neutral

I have always ordered Nutiva brand of shelled hempseed, however, I ordered this brand because I really liked the container with the screw top for easier storage and it's easier to open. I put the container in the refrigerator until I had finished my Nutiva hempseed. Unlike the Nutiva brand, I noticed that your brand has a lot of husk and/or shells with the hemp seed. Is this normal? I hesitate ordering more of your brand because of the husks and/or shells. I must admit, I really like your container, it's a lot easier for me to handle over the plastic bag used by Nutiva. I just wish that it did not have so many husks/or shells and you have really increased your price.;neutral
I really like Marley cups.  However, the problem with this last batch is that the got so many grounds in the cup that I give it 3 stars.  This is the first time I got the variety pack.  Previously, I just got each one separately.  No problems with them...until now.  Still a good cup of coffee but worthy of 3 stars due to the grounds in the cup.  So, quality control may be slipping.  It's all I can think. I don't have the issue with the other Marleys(not the variety pack) that I purchased.;neutral
good.;neutral
Since it contains preservatives, I knew it would taste more 'artificial' than an actual pecan pie, but it was still a little disappointing. The filling is so-so, but the crust is more cheesecake crust than pie crust- very crumbly, cookie-like, with a graham cracker taste.;neutral

"I heard really good things about this stuff and how it is wonderful for people with hypothyroid. I was using it for a couple days before I realized it had a California prop 65 warning (conveniently covered up by an Amazon product sticker) which kind of concerns me. I definitely do not feel like using a product that could cause reproductive issues in the future.

If you are not concerned about prop 65 warnings though then this product is a good choice for you. It's a wonderful iodine sub and will definitely help out with hypothyroid if you use consistently. Taste isn't anything I can say that I love, it tastes like it came from the sea just as it should. If you use it in stir-frys or soups though you won't even know it's there!";neutral

I really wanted to try this because I've been eating a Whole30 and Paleo diet for the last several months and am always looking for new products to add that are friendly to those diets.

It would be better without the mints in it.

I have used this product before, and it makes a wonderful loaf of bread. But Amazon (or wherever it comes from) should really check expiration dates.

I've only tried the Red Berry flavor so this review is strictly for that: I've tried quite a few energy/mental clarity-type drinks on the market and I'm always looking for a new and interesting one particularly since, being in medical school, I don't always get as much sleep as I'd like. Though the taste isn't bad (it's not carbonated so I find it to be a bit on the blah side, though I know some people prefer the lack of carbonation in their drinks) and it's only 45 cal per can which is nice, I haven't found that it gives me ANY extra mental clarity or energy or much of ANY kind of boost (mental or otherwise). I get a pretty nice boost from coffee (which this product seems to have a similar caffeine content to) and Red Bull and Monster but as far as a boost from this - nope. Nada. (And yes, I do know that it's not strictly an 'energy' product but literally it has ZERO effect on me.) If you're looking for something *different* to try, I'd say it's worth it (particularly if you do Subscribe and Save w/ the 20% discount which makes it cost effective) but I wouldn't expect much of a boost from this product - unless you pour Red Bull in it.;neutral
Horrible taste;neutral
There is something wrong with these cups (not from this seller but ALL of these cups at the manufacturer point. I have bought at least 4 packages of this particular cup (specifically the dark magic decaf) and they always only brew about 2/3 of the way. It makes a dark bitter cup because it only brews like 6-8 oz for the large cup!  When you go to eject it the cup is full of hot water. This happens with every package of this specific brand flavor. I do not have this trouble with other green mountain cups or other brands but it is consistent with this one.;neutral
I am on a restricted diet and eat mostly protein, so beef jerky is an easy snack option for me.  I was paying $2.95 for the smaller bags of this product at the little market inside of my office building...I thought I'd be better off buying it in bulk and saving some dough.  Well, I did save some dough, but be warned - if you are used to buying the smaller packages of this product the larger bag will be a disappointment.  The smaller bags have small, bite-size pieces of jerky that are soft while the larger bag contains pieces that vary in size, most are large slabs and they are, at best, semi-soft.  I tried eating the big pieces by biting directly into them, but no dice.  Since I do not want to break my teeth or dislocate my jaw I am now cutting the jerky slabs into bite-size pieces with scissors.  So, yah I saved some dough, but now there's labor involved!  I will more than likely not buy this product in bulk again.;neutral
It `s ok.;neutral
I compared this to Starbucks Antigua. Starbucks is about $10 per pound which is a reasonably good price at least now for premium coffees. I found the Starbucks to have a mellower flavor and not nearly as acidic as the Copper Moon. The Starbucks brand beans do have an oily sheen to them vs. dry beans from Copper Moon. That said, I still think the Cooper Moon is quite good and fine for an everyday coffee. I am generally pleased with it but I will probably revert back to Starbucks since it is better and the price is not that much different. My daughter disagrees with me however. She does not like the Copper Moon at all when compared with the Starbucks. She felt that the Copper Moon had an odd smell.;neutral
I am very careful about ingredients that we have a slight sensitivity to, soy being one of them.  I was suprised when I received this and it states it contains soy.  I will drink it occassionally and have offered it to guests who state they enjoy the smooth taste of this green tea.;neutral
"I love the cracked pepper version of these crackers (wafers? they're not quite crackers, they're much lighter and crispier) so I figured I'd branch out and try another variety.

You'd better really like rosemary, because the rosemary flavor in these crackers is VERY strong.  Like punch you in the face strong.  If you eat a couple by themselves you'll have rosemary taste in your mouth for a while from the strong essential oil in rosemary leaves.  To me, the crackers overpower delicate cheeses and don't compliment the stronger cheeses.  I won't be getting the rosemary ones again, but will continue with the 34 degrees cracked pepper crisps.";neutral

I can't say what it's doing inside my body, but it's supposed to be good for you, so I'm taking it because of that.  The taste is okay, but not great.  Guess it's like most new things, have to get used to it.  Not really bitter as another viewer said, but that's subjective.  What I don't like is the ratio of mixing water with it.  Half to half.

I have a favorite I can only get through a store. Since I live a couple hundred miles from the store and needed something to replace, I thought I'd try this. It will make due until I can pick up some more of my favorite, but won't replace it. It has a different taste and take more for the same sweetness as the brand I prefer.;neutral
Average flavor.;neutral
Have tried it in my Keurig and maybe that's the issue - it's really weak compared to what I expected. Of course nothing beats getting the real thing at the source - and maybe that's just the best.  Happy to get it though, and so glad it comes in decaf.;neutral

"I normally love Garden products, but this one is not one of my favorites. It tastes okay, and I will eat them if they are in the freezer, but if there are other options, I'll usually try the others first.
Every time tart I've made these, no matter how many times I've used some shout out cooking spray or oil, they still stick to the baking sheet. They even stuck to the parchment paper. When I flip them, I end up losing most, if not all of the breading on one side. It's a bit annoying, especially if you're trying to make a pretty dish with them.
I am indeed vegan, and on occasion I will eat meat substitutes just to vary the menu in my house. These taste better than the chicken nuggets and chicken tenders I used to eat, but then again I was never a big lover of real chicken strips to begin with. I like the texture and taste of these when put these in tacos, sandwiches, and salads. They're also not bad when eaten with some sort if dipping sauce. They come with a somewhat small amount, so if your making a family meal, you might need to buy a bigger pack. They are a little pricey for such a small amount.";neutral
This gum is rather bitter and distasteful for the first 30 seconds or so.  After that it is not so bad, but not great either.  I think one would buy this gum only for the pepping qualities, and not for the taste.  The pieces are on the small side, so maybe try pairing it with a more flavorful gum.  Just a thought.;neutral
"The products itself is better than Bob Red Mile's oats bran. While both are fine ground oat bran, Bob's comes with plenty of oat powder which adds a lot of starch.
The way it's packed is bad.  Instead of having such a fine ground product in a sealed paper-bag within the card box, it is packed loose in the box.. Therefore, if not used at once, it has to be transfered to a container, it is easily spilled, and becomes rancid if you long-term store any unopened box in your cupboard.  .";neutral

I'm not real happy with this.

Matcha Love is amazing, neon green and honestly, when I make it with stevia and vanilla almond milk, reminds me of hot cocoa.  This looks more like cocoa with its drab green color but the flavor isn't as grassy and delightful as the Matcha Love.

I have a lot to use now, and will do so.  I am sure if I had started here and gone the other way it would have been a 5 star but this feels like slumming it.";neutral
This sauce is sweet which is not my favorite taste for pasta sauce, but what I expected from Ragu as most of their sauces are sweet.  I was disappointed that the box leaked, however, we live in CO so this could be from a pressure change and altitude difference.  In all fairness, I decided to just cut my losses, and throw away the open jar rather than order more sauce or request a refund. The sauce is in plastic jars which would be good for camping or other outdoor cooking and transport.;neutral
"I make a great lamb stew that I love. So I've got a decent frame of reference. But making it from scratch is kind of a pain in the butt. So I figured I'd give this a try.

It's decent. Not particularly distinguishable from ordinary beef stew. But miles ahead of Dinty Moore. It's little greasier or fattier than I would like, and the chunks of meat and potatoes could be bigger. It's more of a thick soup rather than a stew. Because of the price I probably won't buy it again.";neutral

"As I have read on several other reviews, 3 of my 4 bags arrived open.  They were inside a Bob's Red Mill box, so I am unsure if the problem was Bobs Red Mill, or Amazon (shipper).  The problem was either poorly sealed pkgs, or possibly rough mishandling in the Amazon warehouse.  I didn't bother trying to return or exchange, as this seems to be an ongoing problem with the 4-pack.

I like Bob's Red Mill as it is aluminum free, & keep it on hand for upset stomachs.";neutral
"I agree with an earlier reviewer that this is not as good as the tortilla soup. The Tortilla soup is AWESOME. This is ok, my problem is that there are a lot of other ingredients that you need to get with this, including chicken broth. This is not a problem when you are around the corner from the store, but when you are a good distance away or in a foreign country, it may not be as easy to find broth or to pack it along. The taste as well is just really ""average."" The Tortilla soup, needed very little ingredients to make it taste ""authentic,"" whereas the CNS needed a lot more and still never go there. For that much effort, makes more sense to make from scratch.";neutral

"If you just want good-tasting dried onions, then you might give this product 5 stars.  These dried onions taste as good as potato chips [organic, no salt added] and you would be willing to eat this product by itself without any other food.  However, I'm very concerned that the healthful phytochemicals in these onions have been severely damaged and mostly lost.  The ""sting"" in these onions is completely missing, indicating to me that Frontier either used ""sweet"" white onions deprived of sulfur instead of the organosulfur-rich regular white onions - or - Frontier dried regular white onions in a way that destroys too much of the highly beneficial phytochemicals.  The fact that the product we actually receive has been chopped up too finely instead of the nice, large chunks that we see in the photo also increases the odds that the healthfulness has been damaged.";neutral

You have to be very careful not to overdo it with these drops.  One drop too many and the whole thing is ruined.  I suggest adding one drop at a time and taste testing in between.  Can be difficult to do when using in baked goods.;neutral
Hmm. It's actually tart and sour like a raspberry, flavor is a bit like raspberry chapstick (in a good way?). The tartness is what you'd expect in a sour type of chewy or hard candy and tasted a bit odd in chocolate form. I probably won't buy these again but I didn't hate them. They taste a lot better frozen! And yes, they did arrive partly melted. But you know what? I live halfway across the world and it's almost summer so it would be ridiculous to expect otherwise. If you want to be certain it's completely solid wait until late fall/winter.;neutral

I've long been a fan of the Haribo gummi bears, and in fact won't even eat most other gummy bears. We had friends in Germany that sent us bags of them every year for Christmas and they always bring back fond memories of childhood. While 5 pounds is a LOT of candy, I thought I'd tried these bears from Amazon as they were a good price with the free shipping. Unfortunately I found them to be considerably harder and more difficult to chew than the Haribos you generally get in the smaller gold bags (or the 1 pound bags our friends would send us). Not sure why this is, and the flavor is otherwise okay. But they definitely do not seem to be quite the same quality and I have to wonder if there is a storage issue or some other problem at Amazon that is causing it as I see other reviewers have mentioned it as well. Still, even harder than normal these beat other gummi bears and hopefully with proper storage at home won't get any harder. I doubt I would buy them again from here though but would stick with other sources I've used online and/or locally that provide better quality.;neutral
I don't know what it was about these buy they made me breakout...really bad. I don't really have issues with acne besides for minor blemishes.

One can of this has TWELVE GRAMS OF SUGAR. What is this, candy??? This is a 7 oz can. The labe states that there are TWO serving per can and that each serving has SIX grams of sugar for a total of TWELVE grams of sugar in ONE small 7 oz can. This is typical of companies who load their  product up with sugar and salt. I will stick to making homemade Caponata where I make a whole POT and just add a few raisins or a PINCH of sugar to take out any bitterness. THIS is like CANDY and it also has too much vinegar. NOT like home made at ALL. They should sell this at the candy stand next to the candy bars.;neutral

So far all of the ones that I have tried are flavorless and blah.  The only reason that I drank the ones that have caffeine was for the great flavor and varieties.

So I ordered this coffee and when it arrived I opened it and it smelled great.  When I ground the beans it smelled great.

Good tasting, but seems to be too susceptible to humidity. Other gumballs I've had in my dispenser have lasted months with no change, but these tend to crumble and get stuck in the mechanism of the dispenser after just a few weeks.

This BBQ sauce isn't bad. I've had better but for the price, I can't complain. Kraft Thick and Spicy has more of an artificial smoked flavor with a slight sweetness.

Any Oatmeal is good for you, this brand is not what I expected but it's OK for the price I paid.

"UPDATE 12/14/15 (more than a year later) - dropped down to 3/5 stars.
============================================
I've bought these chips (specifically the 12 and 24 packs) more times than I would like to admit, the most recent order being another box of 12 (big) bags yesterday and in my crushing disappointment I swear they changed the formulation.

These chips used to be cut SLIGHTLY on the thicker side, so the crunch was pretty hefty - this used to be a really solid chip. Last night when I opened the deliver I noticed they feel SLIGHTLY thinner with about 30-40% less crunch as a result.

Overall it's a much lighter chip now, which puts it directly on par with most other over-processed main stream chips I've tried out there.

God was I ever disappointed by this. I can no longer recommend this chip as a ""hands down, best chip around."" -- there are perfectly comparable chips in your grocery store and better chips out there.

Now I have bag after bag of potato chip I no longer find intoxicating...

ORIGINAL Review Below
============================================

The reviews aren't kidding, these really are delicious chips -- my only consistent complaint about them (while I eat a metric ton) are they need a HAIR more salt... like 15% more salt.

They are so close to perfection it is almost not worth mentioning, but I've eaten _probably_ 20 bags of these over the last 6 months so I feel somewhat qualified to comment (and lose 30 lbs!) -- my wife also noticed the same thing on her own which is why I mention it.

Bottom line, if you like potato chips, just order these -- you'll like them.";neutral

I sort of forgot what I think of Starbucks, it has been that long since I've gone to one of their locations for coffee.  Starbucks seems to cover whatever their coffee lacks with a burnt taste, and that burnt taste dominates.  The coffee was a decent price, I just should have gone for a dark roast Sumatra I think.  Next time, for sure.;neutral
What can I say, it's gluten free pasta so it's not going to be superb, but I had hoped for better. I had to cook it much longer than stated and it never got a great texture. The cheese is great though. It could just use a bit more. Its better than other brands I have tried, but still leaves me wanting for a better texture.;neutral

It's pretty tasty, but i've decided that powder peanut butter is kind of stupid.  They take all the good fats and replace it with sugar and salt.  What you get it some taste without feeling satiated or having any lasting energy.;neutral
"The honey is good but not great. I've purchased many that were better (tupelo honey for one).

I've purchased other ""spun"" honeys and none of them were as hard as this stuff is. They said the honey was spreadable but that only happens after you heat it up to melt it some.

I like honey and buy different kinds often, this was the first that I didn't like (not for the flavor, for the consistency) It's like candle wax in consistency with a decent honey flavor.

I won't be buying this again.";neutral

Our family LOVES Highlander Grog coffee, but we were a little disappointed with this one.  There isn't much flavor to it.  It's not terrible, but it's not great.  If you know Highlander Grog and appreciate the taste, this one might not be the one for you.  Amazon has a 5 lb bag (it's a green bag, I think it is Coffee Direct) of HG that has a superior taste, but it only comes in whole bean.;neutral
Not much flavor, but not gross like some others. Add salt and pepper. I haven't found any canned gravy comparable to the frozen Bob Evans gravy, but that's expensive and not regularly kept in stock at any of the three grocery store chains I shop at.;neutral
Extraordinarily pedestrian cup o' Joe - it's the coffee we drank in the 70s - nothing wrong with it, and perhaps it's better suited for the old peculator we've stashed away instead of the fine grind and pour over style - and I want to like it - who doesn't for $5.50 a pound, but it's flavor profile is more akin to dishwater than the strong flavorful coffee I'm now accustomed to - and I put my morning cup in a thermos and drink it an hour after brewing so I can drink it at my desk;neutral
"It is good to have choices for breakfast and this is one of the better quinoa options. The flavor of the blueberry is pretty good but but for me this cereal has way too many calories for the serving size when compared to regular quinoa flakes and my own sweetener choice.

Opening the packet, the smell was very nice. You can detect the wine in the sauce right away. Thick with plenty of mushrooms. I served mine with chicken over jasmine rice.

I got the sweet variety pack for a holiday treat.  There are three flavors: caramel, vanilla and chocolate.  In reality, I just taste coffee, and pretty bitter coffee at that.

I love the Sweet Leaf stevia, but the Vanilla Creme isn't one of my favorites. It's an odd flavor and doesn't taste very vanilla-y to me. If you are new to Sweet Leaf, I recommend trying a different flavor: my favorites are Rootbeer, English Toffee, and Cinnamon.;neutral
This was my first jar of coconut butter and after reading the fantastic reviews, I expected something creamy and delicious. It's not creamy at all unless you stick it in the microwave for 30 seconds, and then it's still not really spreadable.. I've used it to make toasted cheese and toasted peanut butter sandwhiches. The first time I used it, I thought it gave an interesting taste and was nice, but the 2nd time, didn't seem that great.. 3rd time, it didn't melt well at all..I'm not sure if I used the fat from it the first time around or what, but it became almost crumbly when I used it the 2nd time. I tried putting it on brown rice instead of butter, but it didn't melt well and didn't add a great taste at all. It's kind of grainy actually.. Not a smooth consistancy.. For the price I paid for this, I'm very dissapointed. I have searched for recipes to make this myself and have found some that sound like they may end up being a bit tastier, so I'll try making my own from here on out.. I love coconut and all things coconut, but to be honest, I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone, especially at this price.;neutral

"I have become addicted to Trader Joe's Palak Paneer, which is stocked in their frozen section in individual (for me) portions. The cheese is very firm and the spinach is creamed with wonderful Indian spices and just enough of a kick for me. However, I can't get to TJ's all the time, and when I do I usually stock up and my freezer space gets quite cramped. I was thinking that it would be a lot easier if I found a palak paneer that didn't require freezing. The reviews on this were very good so I bought a pack of six. Man. The difference between frozen spinach (green) and this stuff (muddy brown baby poop color) is quite marked. It is not like you would try to serve this to a friend if they stopped by. Or your teenagers.

But I wanted to like this so I closed my eyes and tried to keep an open mind. For me, the cheese is not as nice and the spices in the thin spinach gravy juice are not right. It is not awful to me, but it certainly won't take the place of Trader Joe's in my heart.";neutral
so-so;neutral
This is good coffee, but nothing outstanding.  It was a better buy at the time than Barrie House.  I will go back to Barrie House which, in my opinion, has a much more identifiable taste.  There's nothing wrong with this coffee, but there isn't any reason to order it except for price.;neutral
The flavor of this pizza crust was okay, but it was extremely dense and had a texture more like a pita chip. The mix would make great, albeit really expensive, crackers. For the cost, I don't think it is worth it for my family.  We got one small pizza out of it. It was filling. I could only eat one piece, and I can usually eat 2-3 pieces of pizza.  It was also fairly bland.  I know you can't expect the dough to be the same as the super high-delicious-gluten stuff you get at a restaurant, but I do think non-grain alternatives can be delicious in their own right. This one was just okay. I think you might have better luck making your own from a recipe;neutral
Too sweet and portion isn't great.;neutral

I hate not rating something on its own merits because I love these crackers.  The box is not stuffed with crackers, however, and n Oct. 24th, they were about $25.00 for the six.

I have ordered this item around 8 times in the past year. up until the last two, the quality was great.  Very fresh, and were sweet and soft.  The last two orders have been almost stale!

"I just couldn't like this heat-and-eat lentil dish. From reading the other reviews, I have learned what I could have known sooner: This is a close.approximation of one's dear Indian grandmother's recipe; it is more soupy than firm (think spoon and bowl rather than fork and plate); though it is bland, no harm will come if you add spices, chopped tomato and chopped onion.

Moral: Read the other reviews first. These tips will come in handy, for I have five more packets to use up.";neutral
"I have ordered this coffee regularly and it's excellent.  But, in my most recent order I received ground coffee instead of whole beans.  I mean, it says  on the bag, ""whole beans"" but inside it is ground coffee.  If this is what their quality control is like, now I don't think I can be sure I'm actually getting decaf coffee.  So I don't think I'll be ordering again, sadly.  Too bad, because it is very good, and with Subscribe and Save, quite reasonably priced.";neutral
"This pasta was our first attempt at non wheat pasta.  For taste and consistency I give it four stars, as it is somewhat easy to overcook, which results in mushy pasta.  As many others have mentioned the label is misleading (as so many packaged products are).  I'd be curious to know just how much quinoa is actually in the pasta since it is listed second in the ingredients. I wouldn't be surprised if the pasta is 90% corn.

We tried this for a while and then moved on to Tinkyada's Organic Brown Rice Elbows, which are 100% rice.  They also are much more difficult to overcook.";neutral
I waited 2 months to review so 5 of us could try every flavor. We were very excited to try these. Very disappointed with all of the Cake Boss.

We really liked the Redwood and Diner. I would buy only those 2 again.;neutral
It's okay.  My mom loved the old Marley Tea formulation (now they changed it to sparkling water with 0 calories - it's pretty bland now)  So we were hoping this would be comparable to the old Marley Tea before they changed the formulation.

Bragg Nutritional Yeast Seasoning definitely does impart ""umami"" food, but the smell is just so... yeasty. Tried it on popcorn as a butter replacement... without other flavorings added, the scent overpowers the experience. I've also used it as a pasta topper in replacement of Parmesan cheese and found it to be a much better experience. But to that end, I might as well just use Parmesan cheese! In a pinch, its been great to add umami, but unless you're vegan, just add some actual dairy product! If you're vegan, go ahead and try... will add a neutral umami flavor without the animal product.";neutral

Just OK Coffee, slightly acidic, strong and bold flavor. Starbucks Sumatra is same bean but better. Try the Guatemala Huehuetenango, much smoother, less acidic roast. I always grind the beans to a fine powder before brewing to unlock all the flavor.;neutral

I bought this bar from a Walgreens store and fell in love. So, I decided to buy a case from Amazon. I was charged extra for some sort of special shipping which was a freezer bag included in the box. When I received this product the bars were all melted. I placed in the refrigerator to try to salvage the bars. They look pretty bad and I will never order any chocolate online again. I love the product itself just not from Amazon.;neutral
"Let me start by saying I LOVE coconut-choco-almond combo and was disappointed in these bars.  They are very dry compared to the other Mojo bars and lack flavor.

I love the trail mix Mojo bars and would highly recommend those; get one of the coconut bars at the store to try first before you buy a big box.";neutral
"I like Starbucks Veranda Blend in their Blonde line of lighter-roast coffees, so I decided to try this Bright Sky Blend.

I'm not a fan.  It's OK, but is very acidic / ""citrus-y"" tasting.  I don't know - it just has a very odd ""sharp"" element in the flavor that I really don't like.  I'm also not fond of Starbucks ""regular"" line of coffees -- they all taste over-roasted to me, almost charred/burnt tasting.  So I was happy to see them come out with a lighter roast line.

Like I said, I like the Veranda Blend, but this one?  Sorry ... no.  I'll be passing it along to my neighbors.";neutral
I bought a case because I had read this was the best brand being BPA and guar gum free. Love that it's not full for junk. However it seems you need those stabilizers after all... you can't make ice cream with this stuff! It just freezes to the sides and bottom of the bowl :(;neutral

That said, it's a great snack for those who want something natural and unprocessed. It's an acquired taste. Personally I like the taste of carob, not as a chocolate substitute, but for its own unique flavor. The nice thing about this product is that it doesn't attempt to mimic chocolate. And while I like chewy stuff, this is really chewy...";neutral
Good flavor, short lived.;neutral
They are boring by themselves and have an odd texture, but they are great with tea! The matcha flavor is nice, but the chocolate overpowers it. I would say that if you like sweet cookies, this isn't necessarily the best for you, because it is only semi-sweet. All in all, definitely worth the money, but I don't think I would buy again.;neutral
My second time ordering this item, what I did not like about my second order was the inconsistency of the quantity one box had eleven packs of the almond, I counted twice and there was only eleven packs in a box thats suppose to have twelve.  They were tasty and fresh. My suggestion either someone miscounted or the box should be sealed properly.;neutral

"Like many other reviewers I saw this on Shark Tank. I use almond butter rather than peanut butter so I I'm not going to compare it to peanut butter because if you eat almond butter you know they are not the same.

The Sharks raved over the taste of this product. I was out of Almond Butter and decided to order on Amazon.

The 2 almond butters I normally buy are Southern Style Nuts (at Sams) and Maranantha (commonly found). I believe the second one has palm oil in it, the first one does not. They both taste about the same to me. The SSN is easier to spread.

The 2 mentioned above have no more than 4 ingredients.

Nuts 'n More has added xylitol (as a sweetener), flax, and other ingredients. I was disappointed to find out about the sweetener since it can cause migraines, but I have not had a problem in the 3 times I've used this product.

The texture is also different, almost taffy like. On toast or off the spoon it sticks to your teeth. Not so when mixed in a bowl of oatmeal.

However it does have a high protein level and if you are wanting it for satiety - half the recommended serving is plenty!

I was dissatisfied at first, but the more I have, the better I like the product itself. I'm wondering if I'd prefer some of the flavored butters more.

I'll update as I get closer to the bottom of the tub.

UPDATE 5/22/14: I don't think I'm going to purchase this again, especially in this particular flavor (original). It's just not that good.";neutral

I was so hoping that I would really LOVE this bar, but I didn't.  It has a very strong flavor and was a little too much for me.  Also, there were two opened bars in the box when it arrived.

"Okay, here's the lowdown on vanilla beans (from my perspective). I purchased a 10-pack from another source and they were everything desirable about vanilla beans - plump, oily, plable & smelled heavenly. So, since the 10-pack was okay, I figured it was safe to order a larger amount. I ordered a fourth ounce from the same company and for kicks, I decided to order a fourth ounce from Vanilla bean Kings. Vanilla Bean Kings has such a high rating and rave reviews, how could I go wrong?  It arrived in 2 days (arrived on a SUNDAY - can't beat that Prime membership) but I expected plump beans. The beans I received were skinny & sort of hard. These are not what I consider grade A. Ironically, the other company that sent me a grade A 10-pack, as you recall, I ordered a fourth ounce from them, too, their larger pack was a little less than perfect, too.
My conclusion is, if you are going to buy vanilla beans, buy the smaller quantities because they probably move of the shelf  faster and therefore are fresher than the larger pack. I guess I'll have a lot of beans to make extract with, I can't imagine these skinny beans having much caviar.pop";neutral
I was not very happy with this matcha tea. I liked that it is quite a large size bag for matcha tea. I ike the price of the tea. I liked that it is supposedly organic. What I didn't like is the color. Matcha is supposed to be bright green. Even the tea in the picture is bright green. Well be prepared that when you open the package it will be pea green. Instead of drinking a beautiful cup of green tea you look like you're drinking pea soup. It is also is very clumpy. It doesn't dissolve well at all. The flavor also just isn't there. I usually buy the DoMatcha Organic Second Harvest Matcha Tea, but then I saw this and thought well for the price and size how can I not try it. Well I will be going back to the more expensive smaller size DoMatcha brand. The quality just can't be beat and I enjoy it so much more. I will finish the package of this Matcha DNA brand but I won't buy it again and I wouldn't recommend it.;neutral
This Manuka honey is okay. With all the raving reviews I really had high hopes for this one but it just didn't cut it for me. After trying many different brands of Manuka Honey, My favorite brand is Wild Cape as the flavor is a bit more mild than this one. Also the texture of the Wild Cape brand is a bit more dense/thicker which I like my honey to be. This one is more liquid/watery in texture. In all I was a bit disappointed considering what I paid for the honey but I will not be buying this brand again.;neutral

"I ate shredded beef jerky chew years ago when a friend gave me a can. I liked it and it was pretty good so I thought I'd buy some. Despite the positive reviews I got a mixed bag. It turned out 42% (or 5 out of 12 cans) of the Teriyaki beef chew was bad, I don't know if they tried to slip in some old expired jerky to pull a fast one to cut losses or a bad batch was mixed in. By bad I mean it tasted like saw dust in your mouth and wood chips, when jerky chew tastes like saw dust with bits of wood chips it isn't jerky anymore. Eating the bad jerky is like putting sand in your mouth or better yet ashes or even sand paper. I did however buy a roll of the Hickory (black cans) and a roll of Spicy (red cans) and those were better in my experience. To know if you have a bad can shake the can and if it sounds like a lot of pebbles are rolling around in the can then you got a bad can that will taste like saw dust. If I wanted sand in my mouth I would've went to the beach.

-Pros-
I only got 7 good cans
The good cans tasted like I expected it to taste

-Cons-
Got 5 bad cans
The bad cans taste like saw dust & wood chips
I had to feed the bad cans to the dog

Looks like Buffalo Bill was able to give me the slip on the Wild West Trail and swapped the good jerky I was suppose to get with saw dust. My recommendation, avoid the Teriyaki unless you want saw dust in your mouth and pick up the Spicy and Hickory flavors instead. I have a hunch that no one buys the Teriyaki flavors, that would explain why almost half of the ones I bought were bad. Would I buy this again in the future? Probably not.";neutral
I wasn't sure what I was expecting when I heard about smarties in lollipop form. It tastes just like the little candies. JUST LIKE IT! But those came in small manageable bites.

"Fairly good tea for a change up to my usual Earl Grey routine. It arrived in a vacuum pack block with a nondescript sealed bag that you're meant to transfer the tea into. No instructions included and my order came with a small black bag. The small box it came in had the product description on the end of it in partial form. I was able to figure out what it was based on not ordering any other tea in that time frame. It's not easy to transfer  loose tea from a vacuum pack to a seal-able bag with a small opening. Spoiler alert: there was spillage. The bag is now in my closet with no label on it and I can identify it only through process of elimination.

The tea is okay. Not a knock out hit but definitely a cup I'd pour again for a change up to my routine of Earl Grey tea.";neutral

This coffee is not bad. It tastes ok. I have had better and I have had worse. It's a middle of the road coffee. Some brands of decaf give me a headache and this is one of them.

Okay so I purchased this coffee based on the reviews here at Amazon.com and I have to say I am sorely disappointed. I personally love the taste of cinnamon in my coffee hot or cold. I will often put a cinnamon stick in my coffee. So when I read the reviews about how it had a nice strong cinnamon taste I jumped right on it. Sadly, in my opinion... It does not have a strong cinnamon flavor I would say just barely and although it's not robust it does have a bitter taste to it. I usually have my coffee black no sugar. I'm not sure whether or not that makes a difference here, just thought I'd mention it. So... I'm certain I won't be buying this again.;neutral

I have previously had Wissotzky Earl Gray tea and loved it - very flavorful and aromatic. This White Tea with Jasmine was just ok for me. The smell & taste of jasmine was very subtle, almost not detectable. Ingredients - white tea and jasmine. I ordered this at a special Add On price, I would not order it again. I will finish the rest of the product, and mix it with something for more flavor. But the lack of a stronger jasmine smell & taste makes it just an average cup of white tea for me.;neutral

Very tiny and expensive. I only gave 3 stars due to the amount and the price. These are very expensive, and have to use more than suggested.

I haven't had Jelly Belly for a long time so I was excited to try this again.  It doesn't taste exactly like I thought it would.  I thought I ordered ear wax candy, maybe it's not fresh?

"I am fairly pleased with this purchase. The bottle was well packed and shipped quickly. My main issue is with the implication from the photo of the bottle with cinnamon bark around it and more bark on the label that it contains oil of cinnamon from the bark.

Actually when you get the bottle close enough to read it, you see from the label that the oil is from the leaves, which has a different flavor than the bark.

You may prefer the leaf oil to the bark oil, and I find the leaf oil product to be pleasant- but I really prefer the bark flavor, and had assumed since the bark is all over the packaging and listing, that would be what I'd receive. Marginally deceptive advertising, in my opinion.

The concentration of oil is good and it does produce nice hot cinnamon flavor- just not exactly what I wanted when I paid for it.";neutral
"You'd think they would be very salty, but I consider them to quite mild compared to normal grocery-store pimiento stuffed olives.  I love these.

I bought both Roland and Goya anchovy stuffed olives and they came in separate packages.  However I think it got the ""scratch and dent"" specials since EVERY can was dented, despite being well packed for shipment.  The seals did not appear to be compromised on any of them, but I find this a bit disturbing, which is why I cannot give this five stars.

They taste fine.  Goya brand was slightly saltier than Roland, so I like the Roland a bit more.";neutral
"I bought this because it seems to be quite popular amongst people so I decided to try it and see for myself. The flavors that came in this six flavor variety package were Original, Barbeque, Cheddar, Salt & Pepper, Sea Salt & Vinegar, and Sour Cream & Onion. Although I tried all the flavors, the last three mentioned flavors have dominated my taste buds to create the impression that Pop Chips is mostly of salty or bitter flavors. The Original flavor was okay, gives you an idea of what the original Pop Chips is supposed to taste like. It's cool that it's not baked or fried so it's healthy. When I think Barbeque flavor, I immediately think of Lay's Barbeque Potato Chips. If you can't match or surpass Lay's Barbeque flavor you fail, and Pop Chips fails. You can taste the barbeque flavor but it is very subtle. The same goes for the Cheddar flavor; the cheddar flavor is very subtle. I like the cheddar heavy on please. I'm guessing Pop Chips is trying to make healthy chips so additional flavorings like barbeque and cheddar are moderately laid on. As for the remaining rest (Salt & Pepper and Sea Salt & Vinegar), they're not very tasty and somewhat bitter to boot. If you like bitter than those flavors are for you. I prefer sweet flavors. My mom tried an unfinished bag of Salt & Pepper that I had laid on the table one day and later told me the chips were not very good and to not buy them again. Sour Cream & Onion I like when I'm really hungry or in the mood for sourness and have sweet liquid around to neutralize the sour. When I first received this package, I had touted to my mom about all the good reviews. Needless to say I was disappointed after I tried these chips out. I don't think I would buy these chips again unless I was seeking to eat a little more healthier.";neutral

"Many people, trying to be and sound more sophisticated, substitute the words ""smoked salmon"" for the word ""lox"".  Having eaten the ""SEA BEAR SMOKED SALMON TRIO"", herein being reviewed, (and the literature that comes with it), I have learnt that, whilst all ""lox"" IS smoked salmon, not all ""smoked salmon"" is lox. (SeaBear DOES offer a nice, large package of ""lox""....and calls it ""lox"", and illustrates it, in the advertising flyer that comes with the ""Smoked Salmon Trio"").  But the fish within the ""Smoked Salmon Trio"" is NOT ""lox"". The fish here is dryish, and very salty.  ""Lox"", on the other hand, must go through additional preparation, for it is far more moist than the dryish fish within the ""Smoked Salmon Trio"".  I have seen, (in the ""Cabelas"" catalogue), ""Lox"" described as 'buttery'....which it truly is.  For those who are interested, ""Lox"" also is usually certified kosher -- whilst the fish within the ""Smoked Salmon Trio"" is not.

The smoked salmon within the ""Smoked Salmon Trio"", is, as I have said, very dry and salty.  However, all bones have been removed, (although the skin remains).  This fish also will keep on a shelf!  It need NOT be refrigerated until opened.

The three types of smoked salmon within have very little taste variation to me.  Yes, there is a TINY bit of difference....but not enough to excite my taste buds.  And salmon -- right from cans, especially the top brands and varieties -- right from the supermarket or on Amazon, taste almost the same to me, at a far lesser price.

The literature that comes with this set of three smoked salmon varieties is interesting and informative, as is the history of ""SeaBear"" foods, which is also given.  This company obviously takes great pride in providing good salmon and other products to its customers, and strives to be the best it can be.  I would advise them, however, to emphasize, even more, the difference between ""smoked salmon"" and ""lox"" in ALL its literature, and in the package description of ALL its products. Knowing whether ""Dry"" smoked
salmon, or ""buttery"", or ""lox""-type smoked salmon, is in a package, would be a great help to those who, like me, sometimes get their syntax and meanings confused, betwixt the two.

"I have arthritis issues and drink tart cherry daily. I've tried several brands available on Amazon and I find this one to be a little too sweet and the syrup seems oily and difficult to dissolve in water compared to other brands. Trying to dissolve this in seltzer leaves the drink flat because of excess stirring required. I like to mix one cup at a time and because of the lack of solubility I always find syrup concentrate at the bottom of the glass.

So far the best I've found is ""Dynamic Health Organic Certified Tart Cherry Juice Concentrate"" that comes in the 16 oz. bottle. It is not too sweet and is not oily, which means it mixes readily in water or seltzer.

Update: After consuming a bottle of this I have to say the taste grows on you. And it somehow has a less processed taste than the others I've tried. Will give it another try maybe.

I've been buying these for a while because the flavor is pretty good and it's cheap, but I'm not going to buy them anymore because the quality from bag-to-bag is very inconsistent.. Sometimes the pieces are nice and moist, and sometimes they are dry and crumbly which is disgusting. When the pieces are moist, it's decently chewy jerky with a basic teriyaki flavor -- nothing special but okay, and the price is right. Unfortunately I've just gotten too many bags of dry crumbly jerky and it sucks to throw out a whole bag since the bag is large and expensive. I've tried various methods to rehydrate a dry bag, but it's useless...;neutral
I did a side by side comparison. Popped some with my original Whirly pop - the packages stocked with it. And then popped a bag of this. The taste is good with both. I will stay that the salt is more pleasant with this one. The main difference is that this popped a third less popcorn. There are more unpopped pieces with this brand.;neutral
Not as great as I thought it would be.  I really like the original Chock full o' Nuts coffee, and I thought this would be more bold, but it really is bland.  Don't get me wrong, it's not bad, just not bold like I had hoped.;neutral

I m sorry but I was disappointed... we did a taste test and I truly or my daughter could not tell the difference from another brand of spring water...but I seem to develop a stomach ache later in the evening after a bottle.( I'm going to have another bottle in a couple of days and see if it reoccurs, this will be my 4th try ).. I apologize again but for the price and hype I didn't see it. I held off writing, but after yesterday my daughter had a bottle  and complained of stomach aches last night... I'm of course not positive this is from the water.. but seems rather strange.;neutral
"I only give this three stars because my Tassimo does not recognize these t-discs for some reason.

"I have drank Lipton brand for years. Have tried others in the past and none compare to be as good as Lipton.
I decided to look for these (Lipton tea bags- gallon size) on here (Amazon) when Sam's Club stopped carrying (selling)  them. These are a good price for the amount of tea.
I use these in my ice tea maker and is a very easy clean up since there is only one bag to deal with compared to the smaller quart or single serve bags. Will definitely be buying these again.
My family (6 people) goes though at least 2 gallons a day and would rather have our Lipton iced tea over soda (pop), or anything else for that matter!
I had to contact Amazon today for a refund because the boxes I received was way too old. The tea was very bitter and had a nasty smell and taste to it. Thank you Amazon for taking care of your customers.";neutral
These are OK as candies.  However I was very disappointed in them.  I bought them for the relief of dry mouth, as lemon drops were recommended by my physician.  Unfortunately, these are far too sweet to be helpful with that and also leave me feeling even more thirsty because of their sweetness.;neutral
This tastes very good. It really is a lime it's dehydrated from. Here's the issue. When I tasted it, I had to taste twice because it was missing something. Finally it hit me. There's no sour to this. Not even any tartness. Every lime lover knows, limes are pretty sour. So, here's how I fixed the problem. I had recently ordered a five pound bag of pure citric acid granulated. Some people use it to make bath bombs, some use it for canning tomatoes, some use it for making homemade super sour candy. I put citric acid on everything. Popsicles, chips, popcorn, bacon, burgers, pizza, everything. I mixed some citric acid with the true lime and it really made it pop. I mixed 3 parts True lime to 1 part Citric Acid. Try it.;neutral

Turkish Delight, or Lokum, is a welcome, traditional gift, especially during the holidays. The old-style flavors of rose, pistachio, and almond are fun.

Wanted gum with no high fructose corn syrup, no artificial colors, and.no artificial flavors  This gum fit the requirements.  Loses flavor pretty quickly when chewing, and tended to be pretty hard at first (undoubtedly because there are no preservatives and artificial ingredients), but for the price, those were compromises we were willing to make. Of the varieties we have purchased, the peppermint has the most flavor, but it is still very, very mild and short-lived.;neutral

I used to buy DAK hams years ago and they were tasty, tender, good.  This ham was briney, fell apart and makes Spam taste like gourmet food.  What a disappointment.

These cookies are very tasty.  Mildly sweet & satisfying.  However, they arrived shrink wrapped to one flat piece of cardboard & a lot of the cookies were broken & basically all of them were damaged around the edges.  These cookies have a scalloped edge & by the time they arrived at our door all of the scallops were in crumbles.

It arrived within the time expected but I am amazed that it survived the shipping as it was simply sent in a large envelope.  The flavor was just average and lacking the bit of ""kick"" you expect from a really good salami.  Something was ""off"" as to the consistency/hardness as well.  It was too soft for ""hard"" Italian salami and that leads me to conclude that it was not adequately cured.  I shared this salami with seven friends and family members.  Not one of them was impressed";neutral

Not quite as tasty as I imagined.  Perhaps it's because I made it with almond milk.  I'll have to try with regular milk.  Made a generous amount of potatoes and certainly was quick to prepare.  Based on the one package that I made, I probably wouldn't buy again.;neutral
I'm a newbie to exotic salts but I thought I would try this because of the reviews.  What a disappointment.  To me and my family it just tastes like kosher salt.

We love Newmans brands and use them regularly at our home. I love that organic ingredients are used, and that the products are all natural. AND we all love that the profits go to charity. 5-stars on that. We had been buying the chocolate Newman-O's (similar to Oreos) and they are a hit, so we decided to try these vanilla ones. As with the chocolate variety, the creme filling is wonderful. However, we found the cookies tasted bland and a little stale even. The kids wouldn't eat them at all, and we had to dip them in coffee to enjoy them. Probably not going to purchase these again....the recipe is not up to Newmans standards I'm afraid.;neutral

I really like black tea, and I taste and test, this black currant (even with its English history), it supposedly is the best black currant tea, yet I felt slighted. Because I know it can be better. If the American market were to concentrate on this kind of tea, we can come up with a better flavour from this. I just feel there is a lack of quality. AND TASTE. And I feel we can produce a BLACK CURRANT TEA, (if we want to), that is really pure and tasty that will market it in our USA! That is up to the tea experts, and I think what we have now needs updating and change and product improvement. My request is for an AMERICAN tea producer, such as BIGELOW to look into producing a good american tea leaf mixed with black currant additives or what not. Pure American tea leaf with black currant sounds like something I would buy.;neutral
"To begin with, I think stevia tastes awful no matter how you mask it. I grow it outside and have picked the leaves off and chewed them just to see if maybe the 'freshest possible' might make a difference. It doesn't. Stevia is just bitter and nasty and leaves an aftertaste.

There are a couple of brands that get all the accolades and all the advertising and this is one of them. Since most food things are a personal preference, one can not argue that it 'is' or 'isn't' tasty and good as you either like it or you don't.

All I can say is I haven't necessarily found a stevia that doesn't taste like stevia - LOL! But, I have found an item that I DO like better than this one - is twice the amount in ounces and costs less, and with less of an aftertaste, but still has an aftertaste. I did not get it from Amazon, however (how rare!).

There are better ones out there, and that give you more, for less money. Keep shopping.";neutral
"Well, the rose buds came ok. And I guess that is just what they are, I just never really tried this product before and could develop inadequate expectations. I know how the mature full size rose petals taste and smell, this is nothing similar.

When brewed, they are essentially tasteless. Almost completely. When I make a ""tea"" using them exclusively, it becomes a lightly pink colored flower water, fresh but weak taste.
I use them in blends with mint, raspberry leaves and chamomile petals, it works but then again in a complete drink I never identify what is it that came from these rose buds. Maybe the difference without it would be totally negligible, beyond what our sense can notice.";neutral
this  used to be my favorite tea of all time due to it's malty flavor...that was before Brodies changed the size of the teabags and the amount of tea in them.

I have been drinking African rooibos tea for the past four years.  I purchased this brand because my regular brand was out of stock.  It ts definitely a lighter tasting brew and not the full bodied flavor that I am accustomed to and enjoy.  I brewed the tea the same way in my infuser.  I also increased the strength but to no avail.  This is a matter of personal taste.  That is why I gave it 3 stars for being a just ok rooibos in my opinion.;neutral

I ordered again and this time the packaging was great.  Problem is about 20% of the pods are decaf.  If people want decalf they special order it.  Now all I have left of the pods are unwanted decalf pods.  You need to offer all regular before I would order a third time.;neutral
"The taste of the almond butter is very good, but it's very runny and you pay a big price for the taste.  Even after refrigeration overnight, it's still the consistency of honey.  And the small jars are not full.  I think the reason they are not completely full is because it's so oily that they needed to allow space in the jar to stir all the oil back into the butter.  This butter has 17g of fat, and all the other almond butters I've had (raw and roasted) only have 16g fat, so I suspect Zimtal is diluting their butter with almond oil to strengthen flavor and make their butter stretch farther.

If you want an expensive but nice almond butter dip, get this.  If you want almond butter to put on sandwiches or fruit or other places where you don't want it to run off, then buy another product.  (I thought Maranatha organic raw butter was nice and will likely try it again.)";neutral

I would suggest you order just one of these, because this is a matter of taste.

Besides this I've had Nature Factor organic, Amy & Brian, Blue Monkey, and Naked coconut waters and actual coconut water from the coconuts growing in my front yard (years ago).  Based on flavor alone this one tasted like it was processed too long, a one-note sweetness and not much else.  For me what was missing is the fresh, enzyme-y, multi-note flavors Amy & Brian or other brands capture that is similar to raw coconut water. On the plus side:  no tin can off-flavors like I've experienced with Blue Monkey or an occasional can of Amy & Brian's and the price is tolerable.  Amazon delivered in excellent condition on time. Taste Nirvana coconut water  - just not the right taste for me.;neutral

After becoming addicted to nespresso coconut..which is discontinued I looked to find a way to make coconut flavored coffee.the flavor of this is really nice and like that its natural.

It also runs down the side of the bottle wasting a lot of it.;neutral
"These sticks are somewhat comparable to Slim Jims - processed meat and ingredients pre-pressed into a defined, and equally scored strip. I can't quite tell if they are encased in an edible plastic or coating (kinda seems that way), but this coating I think I feel isn't as thick or prominent as in Slim Jims. Now I love Slim Jims, but I think because of they way they are made, using different meat types doesn't make a huge difference, especially based on what other ingredients are included - it seems like the ingredients in these type of jerkies (Wikipedia says that's word, not sure if that's true) are more important than the meat.

What I'm getting to is that despite having variety of different meat types in my sampler - ostrich, venison, bison, beef, alligator, they all tasted mostly the same. Perhaps one strip might be slightly more or less dry, oily, or tough than the others....but I couldn't tell a difference unless MAYBE I did a taste test of all then while cleansing my palate between each taste - but what kind of jerky eater does that?

I'm not personally a huge fan of the ""eating experience"" of this particular type of jerky - I like the stripping of the meat from ""real"" jerky and the ""snaps"" of Slim Jims, but this isn't either. You can try to tear into these with your front teeth and/or molars, or you separate the stick at the scored lines evenly divided down the trip. The score lines are not a problem, it's just something about the texture, density and composition of the meat that just make me say ""Eh, it's alright I suppose""

These aren't bad, but considering I couldn't tell which meat was what if you blindfolded me as they all tasted the same, I can't make an argument for paying the premium of this exotic meat when I think the eating experience of more well known jerky is better in my personal opinion.";neutral

"When we visited Belgium, the Chocolate capitol of the world, we asked a local what his favorite brand of chocolate was, and he said ""Lindt.""  I personally strongly disagree, fresh Belgium chocolate can't be beat (all the major chocolate makers are located within a three block radius, you can taste them all, the stores must be refrigerated so the chocolate doesn't melt), but Lindt does make some excellent quality chocolate bars.

I decided to try the Lindt fancy box chocolate truffles to see how it compared.  It tasted awful, compared with fresh Belgium.  It tasted like it was coated in a plastic type coating so that it could ship in the summer, or not spoil on the shelf.

Lindt does do a good job for a mass production distributor, that has to use preservatives so it can stay on the shelf for a year if necessary, or ship in the summer if necessary. No chocolate tastes good once you have had freshly made chocolate, like Leonidas.";neutral
"Whatever those food wizards at Smucker's have done to this ""Mild Roast"" version of FOLGER'S BREAKFAST BLEND COFFEE, it looks quite dark and smells heavenly right out of the can.  When brewed, though, it has that tippy-hollow beany aspect so unfortunately reminiscent of mass-produced, modestly-priced American ground coffee blends of the past 25 years or so.  I am not fussy about many things, but my black coffee is one of them.  I put cream in this one.

Actually, most people who put sugar or cream in their coffee will likely be fairly well pleased with this one.  I'll enjoy mine that way -- just not terribly much.  On the plus side, the distinctive Folger's red plastic can is great for all kinds of repurposed uses!

The foil is extremely wrinkled up all over... god only knows where all this thing has been.  Not the best price I have paid for the size of this product either.  Unless I get a bad surprise inside the bag, it should be use usable (none leaking out that I can tell).  But I will try to source it locally before it runs out.;neutral
Chia bar is okay.. nothing special;neutral
These are ok, wouldn't say it is the best quality chocolate.  It was cool to share these and taste a bit of Ireland without having the benefit of visiting.  So for that reason it was worth the buy but I don't anticipate ever craving these but worth the experience of a bit of culinary travel just to see what other folks are eating, lol.;neutral
This, as well as other bulk food items, helped me get through grad school without a car. Eh. It was the best of times, It was the worst of times. I don't think anyone buys it specifically for the taste though.  I've noticed the pricing has skyrocketed since I last ordered it. Oh well.;neutral
Not super fresh;neutral
"I will have to agree that the presentation was quite nice.  It came gift wrapped in a decorative box; however it is quite small.  The candies in it are so tiny.  I got this as a guest gift but it is so small it is embarrassing to give.  Not worth 40usd.";neutral
"It's going to be hard to find one that actually tastes like fresh coconut juice, maybe if a freeze dried juice was available. Don't get me wrong it tastes like coconut and would make a great non dairy creamer or blended in recipes etc, but as far as an instant coconut juice I'm still looking.
This coconut milk does have a lot of healthy fat which is great for hiking and other strenuous activities where additional calories are needed.

Update: 8/1 - I had previously rated this product 5 stars but unfortunately as another reviewer noted this company recently added more fiber to address clumping issues. That also reduced the coconut fat, a mistake IMO so now it's 3 stars.
At $20 a pound (with shipping) I want the product without added ingredients.
I probably won't buy it again.";neutral
Coffee not so strong;neutral

"I didn't read the description carefully as I expected whole beans but I got ground coffee. That's my mistake but not the reason for the three stars.

I like the idea of having a crap ton of caffeine in my coffee. For me, the more the better. I am not a chemist or whatever, so I cannot verify their claims about being the world's strongest coffee. I drink a lot of caffeine and am usually constantly caffeinated--for good or ill--so I couldn't tell if there was a difference in this and other brands I use. If you don't drink as much caffeine as me, your experience may differ.

This gets three stars because I simply did not like the taste. For reference, when I go into a local coffee shop, I order an americano or an espresso. I may add a dollop of honey or a bit of splenda but I'll also have it black. All that to say, I like the taste of coffee. I didn't really like the taste of Death Wish. It just wasn't for me hence the three stars. Taste is subjective so your miles may vary.

I thought the packing was well done and it sealed right back up after my initial use.";neutral
Not great, but it does the job of filling the tummy with minimal effort.  Ordinarily, I try to avoid products that create excess waste (the disposable cups) but these were for my elderly grandmother who really cannot cook for herself any longer.  The dining facility at her residence offers a choice of two entrees for dinner, but sometimes she won't eat either one.  That is when something like this comes in handy.  If I lived closer, I would love to take her food-- but a 12 hour drive prevents me from doing so.;neutral
LOVE Perrier spaarkling water, NOT SO MUCH for the flavored Green Apple. Doesn't taste refreshing like the plain kind. Would not order any flavored one again. This time the packaging was also broken into, but since it was encased it a box nothing was spilled out. Caps were all sealed.;neutral
Purchased a different Amish popcorn before and had excellent results with our air popper, however this time these kernels didn't respond the same way.  Tasted good, but did not pop completely with the air popper.;neutral
"So, the reason I buy this brand of coffee is because it reminds me of coffee in Turkey. Its not necessarily the best coffee, but it is decent. One thing I learned about since purchasing this a few times is that you can get ""Turkish Coffee"" from most coffee shops or supermarkets. The ""Turkish"" part is how fine you grind the bean. Fresh Market (regional market) even has a ""Turkish Ground"" setting for the bean grinder. So, I have found many other great coffees that are more affordable and better tasting than this product. I still enjoy this coffee, just wanted to share some ideas.";neutral
When I don't want to spend the money on my favorite K cups, the Barista Prima Italian Roast, then this will work as a weaker and less expensive substitute. It's strong enough, but is not as smooth and rich as the Barista, and it does have some bitterness. I can drink it, but it's not my favorite.;neutral
I got this brand because it was less expensive.  Unfortunately, I didn't do my homework that day!  The serving size is 2 tablespoons and the carbs are 22 grams.  The other brands I've been using are 1 tablespoon and 8 to 10 grams of carbs.  If a person can tolerate the carbs, it's a fine product.  However, I'm very carb sensitive.  It gives me a buzz which I do not like.  I can't recommend this product based upon my experience.;neutral
Halvah used to be a health food desert. This is not it!. Ingredients used to be: crushed sesame seeds and honey. This is sesame powder, fructose (corn syrup solids), palm oil, and some long name chemicals. It does not taste as good and is not as healthy, It tastes a lot like like the other junk food from M+M, or Mars, or Hershey. Probably slightly healthier than most, but not like the original. My friends who never tasted the original, liked it and the whole package is now gone.;neutral
I don't know whats going on but this is nothing like i expected. I can't do anything with this stuff. There is no peppermint smell or taste. It is more like dried grass with a lot of dust. Thankfully I was able to get a refund. But I don't think I will order this again.;neutral
I thought that this would be a heftier noodle...more like the typical udon noodle.  However, this noodle is not as substantive as the Nongshim Ramen Noodle soup.  The flavor was indistinguishable from the Nongshim Spicy Gourmet Ramen.  Given the similarity in taste and the smaller width of the udon noodle, I  will continue to order the Nongshim ramen soup.;neutral
too small and was delivered late;neutral
I'm a bit disappointed with this 'premium' popcorn.  I've had much better results with other brands, like Jolly Time.  The flavor and texture just aren't up to the high standards of Bob's Red Mill products, in my estimation.  I'm a huge fan of all the legumes they offer, like their yellow and green split peas.  This popcorn, however, is just so-so, and I'm not buying it again.;neutral
I have ordered other seaweed products off of Amazon bc I live in an area where it is hard to find seaweed at the grocery store. I wanted to try a different product so I ordered this brand of seaweed. I didn't find it to be as tasty as other brands and it was a little greasy. I have a special needs son and a toddler and they did like the taste of these so it wasn't a waste. Probably wouldn't buy again unless they use less oil.;neutral
"This tea is not something special at all. Yes, it is packaged in a nice looking container, but it is all good about it. The tea taste is very so-so and If I would guess, I would say that this is at least 1 year old leaves with tea aroma almost gone. On the top, it is only 75% of the container is actual tea leaves, the rest is just an air. So, if you drink tea everyday, you would need to buy this package every week and a half....
I wouldn't buy it again. It cost a lot while the test and quantity is just a little.";neutral
"I love cashew butter, but there's something about Artisana's that tastes damn good it's creamy, fatty, and delicious. I cannot recommend this nut butter enough to you, and I hope you try it with something like a baked sweet potato or a banana.

EDIT  UPDATED REVIEW It appears that less and less cashew butter is coming in each jar! What the heck, Artisana! Please put the regular amount of cashew butter back. This time, I actually asked for a replacement from Amazon because there was not enough cashew butter packaged inside.";neutral

"After learning my lesson being stuck with tons of K-Cups I don't like, and needing something new in the morning, now that Wake Up Call has been discontinued, I gave this a shot.

The presentation is actually really, really nice. I'd almost go as far as saying it would make a nice gift for someone who owns (or is receiving) a new Keurig, because everything is laid out clearly in a nice looking box.

The coffee I received was a little different than what was in the picture. I didn't get Tree Hugger, or the Gloria Jean's coffees. I did, however, get three decaf K-Cups, which are pretty much useless to me. I used to keep a couple around the house just in case a guest came over who didn't drink regular coffee, but I literally can't give the stuff away.

I could understand tossing a couple of decafs in to a flavor variety pack, but on an ""Extra Bold"" sampler? That's like getting sugarless gum in a box of chocolates.";neutral
"Whats not to love about this classic assortment? If you're wondering this big bag had about 224 bars.

I have always enjoyed this as an instant powder, so thought I would like the k-cups. Using any  of the three cup settings on my Kuerig is not satisfactory. Small cup setting is too strong and pricey. Large cup setting is colored water. It doesn't seem to be measured for the Kuerig. I will go back to the powder and my microwave;neutral
I didn't really taste it and I didn't want to dump a ton on my vegetables. I just wanted it to give my vegetables a bit of a flavor but it didn't. I just went back to using sea salt. It doesn't have a bad taste, just can't tell the difference between this and regular table salt.;neutral
"I really did not like these.  The product made me feel jittery and terrible, much more so than if I drank even a whole pot of coffee.  It was not a pleasant taste either, but more of a drink I would ""force down"" as quickly as possible.  The packaging is really, really cute and I like the graphics.  My husband liked the espresso the best and thinks all four flavors are okay.  Despite his more positive review of these he admits that he probably would not buy Forto coffee shots again, though.  In the future I'll stick with canned iced coffees in a larger format that are not ""energy drinks"" as this just wasn't for me.";neutral

I am afraid I am still searching. Even with all the flavor and enhancement packs, all can muster is a bleh. And on the topic of packets, really? Make them a little easier to dispense.

I'm not sure if it's me or this mix.  The actual flavor is awesome!  However, often times the dough seems like it didn't bake correctly and is a bit slimy.

I am partial to the coffee people's donut shop as my favorite kcup.  I tried this for some variety to offer others and certainly there were no complaints.

"I can remember when SANKA INSTANT DECAFFEINATED COFFEE first came out.  It was cold, in those far-off cave-days, and we had to be wary of the occasional roaming saber-tooth tiger.....

OK, OK -- so I'm NOT THAT old, and neither, (despite being around for 50 years or so), is SANKA INSTANT DECAFFEINATED COFFEE.  In actual fact, though I saw (what was probably the first) ADS for Sanka Coffee, I never got to drink it, because 1)I wasn't old enough to drink coffee then, and 2) In our house, we used up one jar of instant coffee before buying another, and then, only usually when it was on sale, and we had a coupon for it.

From what I remember, SANKA was one of the first, (if not THE first), decaffeinated coffee around.  But now -- so many years later -- I notice that there are TWO VARIETIES of SANKA instant coffee to be had:  DECAFFEINATED, and NATURALLY DECAFFEINATED.  I don't
THINK there were two types of INSTANT SANKA around then....but, when finally buying some for myself, I decided to opt for the NATURALLY decaffeinated instant -- both because I strongly suspect that this was the original, and because I, along with so many others, believe that ""naturally"" is the best way to prepare anything....

The jar, of course, has changed.  It always featured an orangy-coloured label --but to begin with, it had
a picture of what looked like a middle-eastern carafe on it.  This, I suppose, put the image of good and rich Turkish coffee in the would-be buyers' minds -- though I'm not sure it ever contained any Turkish coffee....

Well, the jar still has an orangy-label. The middle-eastern caraf, however, has long been gone from this label.  This doesn't bother me that much.  But -- IT NOW COMES IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENTLY SHAPED JAR FROM THAT PICTURED HERE ON AMAZON, EVEN AS I WRITE MY REVIEW! Not only this.....but the jars of this coffee that I received are made of ---- P_L_A_S_T_I_C____!!!!!!

Everyone today -- or most people, anyway, have, I think, some ideas in their mind of the things they think MIGHT herald the end of civilzation as we know it, for, after all, this IS 2011.  And next year....!....well, who knows?

Someone wrote that the end of civilization just MIGHT be indicated by the multi-nominated Susan Lucci actually winning a Daytime Emmy Award.  (This happened --but NO-ONE, to my knowledge, ever predicted the CANCELLTION of the wonderful soap-opera, ""All My Children"", on which Ms. Lucci appears. (!)  For myself, I've always had this idea that as long as the instant coffees produced by Maxwell House came in GLASS jars, we were somehow safe.  But now, I find that SANKA INSTANT, NATURALLY DECAFFEINATED, in the 8 oz jars, (pack of 4), are presently actually being packed in ...(gasp!)....PLASTIC!  And not only plastic -- but in No. 1 plastic!  (Only No. 5 and No. 6 platics are reputedly safe -- to reuse that is.  Still....I feel queasy about this.  And now to my mind comes the even more horrible thought that perhaps ALL Maxswell House Instant Coffees will soon be packed in PLASTIC jars!  PLASTIC NEVER KEEPS IN FLAVOUR A WELL AS GLASS DOES!

....................As far as the flavour of THIS coffee goes, (and I'm sorry I took so long in getting to this main point) -- it's good....but not great.  A mild flavour with just a hint of underlying deep richness is how I'd describe it.  I made it the way instant coffee should be made -- with water that has been boiled as MUCH as possible, (when making tea, let the water boil as LITTLE as possible.)  So -- this coffee is good -- but nothing really spectacular.  As always, like other instant, (and regular), coffees, it's also best kept in the refrigerator after opening, to preserve whatever flavour is there....especially now, when it is in a (gulp!) PLASTIC jar!

The new jar is easy to hold, with a cylindrical base, then half-way up, it slopes slightly inward.  Around the upper portion are indentations, which look like drops of water, and, I suppose, are supposed to represent perked-coffee flavour.

To me, however, they somehow look like tears...  :_(";neutral
The serving size on the nutrition label is the entire pack, and that's too big for one sitting. 400 calories and 32 fat grams? Anyone who snacks on these like nothing will gain 20 pounds over the next month! I wish they had the 100cal snack packs like Blue Diamond does with their nuts. Seriously 1 of these is the equivalent to 3 of those airplane peanut bags they hand out.;neutral
Not bad, but you're not going to impress a date.  They taste healthy. :)  I would get a spread of some sort, they tend to be a little dry.  Other than that, they're well priced and a great alternative to keep your mouth away from something more unhealthy.;neutral
It mixes pretty well with cold juice, I use 4 scoops in 10 oz cold grape juice to get my 30 g protein quota first thing in the morning. I like that it comes from grass fed cattle, based on principle. I don't notice any real flavor to it so I'm likely to use it as a thickener in other recipes, as needed.;neutral
"I love, love, love good chocolate tea.  My favorites are Yogi Tea's Mayan Cocoa Spice and Republic of Tea's Chocolate Mate.  When I read the really good reviews of this product I ordered it.  And, it's okay.  It doesn't have the deep chocolate taste I look for in a tea.  Maybe there are too many spices with the chocolate.

I'll stick to my previous favorites.";neutral
It was great to have an option without sugar.  I prefer jerky that is quite a bit drier than this biltong. If you like tender dried meat where you can taste the beef and not chemicals then this may be the jerky (of sorts) that you are looking for.  I wasn't aware of what biltong was like, so it was worth the trial. I probably won't reorder since it's not quite what I'm looking for.;neutral

"Honestly I'm having a difficult time trying to decide how to write this review since matters of taste can be so different for different people. I've tried quite a few different kinds of ramen, and I'm just not a very big fan of this ramen. The flavor just doesn't do much for me. It's not a very strong flavor, and the spiciness kind of overpowers what's there.

All in all it was nice to try something that you can't find at most local supermarkets, but I wouldn't buy this again.";neutral
I was slightly underwhelmed with this product.  I took a chance on ordering a 3-pack, and it's not terrible.  I've certainly tasted much worse peanut butter from the store.  But the product is a bit thinner than other all-natural products I've tried in the past, you do have to stir it up he first few times you use it.  Even then, it drips.  My kids like to eat peanut butter off the spoon, and with this one I'm afraid it will spill over the edges or drip down their wrists.  The flavor is a little flat, not bad, there's just no WOW factor.  The kids do like it, and that's what important.  I made up some for my husband too, and I don't think he noticed it was different once it was made into a PBJ.  Maybe it will grow on me.;neutral
I bought this in a Long Island gas station was amazed by the taste for only 35 calories! I then had to buy some online to see maybe one bottle day would effect my mood. I had one everyday for about two weeks and although tasty and low calorie, I did not see any effect on my mood. If it were cheaper, I would buy it just to drink daily whether or not it made me 'blissful' but at about 2.50 a bottle, it's just not worth it.;neutral

Doing the low carb thing and decided to try this. It's ok. It's not nowhere as good as the Nutella but I didn't really expect it to be. It has that artificial sweetener cooling effect to it.

Delicious!  I really like Blueberries so I thought I would give these a try.  Fantastic!  I wrote to the company overseas as one of us has food allergies to find out if he could eat it.  NO RESPONSE.  So 5 starts for the great product and ZERO stars for unresponsive customer service.;neutral
The taste is all right but every time I open the bag this sugar smells like it's been burnt.

I love brie, especially triple cream, but this brand was just okay. Frankly, I found it to be very expensive for the size and quality.

Nostalgic addition (11/07/16):  An Englishman is used to a mincepie being the norm.. not ""gourmet"" or anything fancy.

"These are pretty tasty, if a bit tooth-achingly sweet, and they're a great snack for a nursing mother in desperate need of calories. However, I'm a little curious about where all the cashews are.

I love these lollipops and the product itself was perfect but I would not order this item again. There were not 100 lollipops in my box.

I was so disappointed by the size of the beans and the tiny amount in the package.  I've been ordering vanilla beans for years as I ran a busy Bed and Breakfast and made all our vanilla.

It is an economical way to use a Keurig. K-cups can get really expensive and are so wasteful. This is a nice way to make individual cups in your Keurig without the waste or cost.

"I reacted to this like I do to any other dairy product. It claims to be 100% free of casein and lactose from being cultured, but maybe it wasn't cultured enough. I don't have a life-threatening allergy either, but it's unfortunate I could not tolerate it.

Also, it did not taste or look any different than regular ghee, and I did not taste the ""brown butter"" taste that was described as ""nutty."" When a family member made brown butter ghee, it was actually a darker color and was described as being a different taste.

However, for anyone who can tolerate ghee and is looking for a good tasting one, I don't think this will disappoint. It is just not special from other ghees in taste to me, and it did not work with my body.";neutral
I bought this to use as a last-ditch effort to increase my milk supply.  However, there are so many ingredients in it!  The main ones being fennel and anise.  I have a very strong aversion to anything licorice smelling or flavored, so I couldn't get it down.  I tried a suggestion I read online and mixed it with apple juice, but no good.  The juice mellowed all the flavors of the tea except the fennel.  I had to switch over to the fenugreek pills.;neutral
I bought a can of this for mochas and was actually disappointed.  It's not horrible, but it doesn't dissolve well and leaves a chalky aftertaste.  My husband and son like it for hot chocolate but it doesn't work well for mochas.  I think I will stick with Torani.;neutral
Good value. Hard to use for kids.;neutral

"Let me start of by saying I really really wanted to like this olive oil. Organic, naturally processed, from California, great price, awesome reviews. I was hoping I'd find a full bodied balanced tasty olive oil to take the place of my expensive olive oils from Spain. Please note, I am a sommelier and have a pretty refined palate. Just like with my wines I look for balance. I don't mind acidity, I don't mind bitterness, I don't mind a bit of fresh herbaceous taste. Balance for me is key. I like my olive oil to be  rich, nutty, and full of balanced flavor. Fruity, buttery, earthy, peppery are all good ...again they need to be in balance.

This oil is way too overtop green and grassy tasting. If you like the taste of wheat grass juice then this will be up your alley. I pored an ounce in a dish and just dipped my bread in it. Full bodied, very grassy, good acidity, with a long somewhat bitter finish. Maybe made into a dressing you can hide some of these overpowering unbalanced favors. Who knows these flavors might even signify a healthier olive oil with more antioxidants? I'll pass. I am returning the olive oil and sticking to what I know I like.

Update: I hate wasting food and the thought of  returning the Item did not sit right because I knew the item would just be thrown in the trash. So I tried to see if I can use the item for cooking and not straight out of the bottle. Tonight I grabbed four medium tomatoes from my veggie garden, two cloves of garlic, 1.5 ounces of the olive oil, salt and pepper. I heated the oil in a skillet, sliced the tomatoes and added them to the hot oil, added the crushed garlic cloves, salt, and pepper. Cooked over the stove top for 3-4 minutes at high heat while occasionally stirring. I then added a few eggs to the mixture , put the lid on the skillet, and let the eggs poach in this thick tomato sauce for 5 minutes. Finally I added an ounce of crumbled feta cheese at the end. Had this for dinner with some Ezekiel bread tonight. Very yummy! The olive oil's over the top grassy flavors were masked by all the other ingredients. So I decided to keep the oil to use in my recipes and not as my go to dipping oil.";neutral
These almonds are OK, nothing extraordinary, but not bad either.  They are not as smokey in their flavor as the Blue Diamond Almonds that I have had in the past, but it is hard to say that you will go wrong with them either.;neutral
When I first started getting this product, it was pretty good.  Now it's hard to tell if it has hazelnut in it.  I strongly recommend that if you buy this kind of thing, get the smaller boxes even though per unit cost is higher.  Then don't use as much of it as a regular thing.  Once you get the big boxes, I've decided they just spray something on them to add some flavor because they all taste the same.  Better yet, brew some real coffee and save a little money.;neutral
I've gotten this coffee directly from Keurig and it tasted better than this coffee. This one tastes weaker. My husband and I both agree on this. I'll be switching back to the Barista Prima Italian Roast k-cups when these are gone. That's always a good, strong cup of coffee that we both like.;neutral
Taste is okay. However the nuts had not fully matured and tasted slightly bland and on the dry side. The larger Brazil nuts I've had in the past seem to contain more oil and much better taste. I would buy again only if the nuts were larger & mature.;neutral
"My wife and I got it on subscribe and save, then ended up taking it off subscription because it's literally ""just ok.""  It does beat a lot of other flavors, but with so much competition out there, in the end it's average.";neutral
Waaaay too sweet. :o(;neutral
I bought these beans for experimenting with homemade soy milk and tofu. The flavor is fine, but in 4 cups of soy beans, there is at least 1/4 cup of beans that will not absorb water.  I don't know all the reasons that beans don't absorb water, but I will say that in trials with 4 other brands of soybeans, I have not seen this problem. I pick through the  beans carefully in any case, it just makes the task more difficult when I have to pick out tiny round beans. Additionally, when the shipment arrived, the bag was unsealed completely, not so much as a twistie tie or knot in the bag.;neutral
"Has a strange texture, but tastes nice.  not my favorite oatmeal, but not disgusting either.

I bought it for my 4 year old thinking she would get a bit more protein for breakfast, but she refuses to eat it.  She normally isn't particularly fussy.  It honestly isn't terrible though.  I think she just dislikes the weird texture.";neutral
Chocolate has  no flavor !!;neutral
The can arrived all dented up. I was pretty disappointed about that so I'm removing 2stars. I'm surprised that it was even stocked for Amazon Fresh!!! If I saw this on a shelf in the supermarket, I would have left it right there. The oil inside is rich tasting and tastes good. It's a shame that the can was a hot mess!;neutral
"These were used to fill a Leprechaun's ""Pot of Gold"" for a St. Patrick's Day Party.  They not only did NOT fill the pot (using 2 LBS of these coins), but they did not taste that great either!  Also we had to throw away about 20 of the coins in one package because they came with only one side covered in the Gold Foil and the other side had been exposed to the package they were shipped in... poor Quality Control!!!  I would NOT buy these again nor would I recommend them to anyone.  Definitely NOT worth the price that was paid!!!";neutral
"In general I love these chips. Unfortunately they were sent 2 months past best by date. Outer box only notes ""Please Rotate date sensitive product"" with no indication anywhere what that date is.
I was expecting this large quantity at least 2 months before best by date, as every other month is suggested by subscribe and save. I am canceling that option and never ordering these from Amazon again unless someone contacts me to confirm this is fixed.";neutral
Just ok ...no kick. Won't buy again;neutral
"Very tasty, yet tough and difficult to chew.  Slices are vey thin and leathery.  My wife can hardly eat them, and they get stuck in my teeth every time.  This has been our experience from trying just one bag.  Still, I would rather eat these than the usual overly sugared and processed pineapple products on the market--including many sold in the ""health food"" marketplace.";neutral
Jam is a bit too sweet for my taste. Seems to me to be more of a puree than jam, hardly any whole or pieces of fruit. I actually prefer Smucker's Strawberry over this. Only downside to Smucker's is by the last quarter of a big jar, it's all jam & no fruit.;neutral
These almonds are fresh and nicely seasoned. Not overly salty as some are. The problem I have with them is there seems to be skins on some of them (or something) that flakes off in your mouth while you're eating them.  It's bothersome, much like popcorn husks are bothersome, and they make my mouth feel very dry.  These are not something I can take to have in the car to curb hunger, because I can't eat them unless I happen to have water or something to drink at hand.  Other than that, they are fine, but I will try another brand.  I have really come to appreciate the slight chewiness and sweetness of raw almonds, so that's what my next order will be. Just for the record, my husband had come to the same conclusion on these almonds before we even talked about them.;neutral
"in the midst of this Hostess Apocalypse no one ever demands that some other company rides to the rescue of the Zinger.  The Twinkie yes, maybe even the cupcake, but alas, not for the poor zinger.  In short, it is ALMOST an elongated (dare I say twinkie-like) Hostess cupcake.

The cake is chocolate, the cream filling is hostess-basic, and the frosting is very much like the cupcake.  However, it does taste SLIGHTLY different.  Perhaps the cake-to-filling-to-frosting ratio is just different enough, but I've always thought the cupcakes were just a little moister.  I did purchase some of these recently though and perhaps as an adult my taste buds have changed, but I liked the zinger better than the cupcake this time around (the cupcake was at a disadvantage as it had been squashed almost flat by the USPS, still 'good', but rather flat--literally).

In any case, let me be clear.  This is junk food of the highest order and really the only redeeming quality is to bring back nostalgic thoughts of sneaking these as a child.  I certainly wasn't allowed to eat them.  As an adult I never ate them until the threat of never seeing one again arose and so here they are.  Not technically good, but an oh-so-fun thing to eat one or two of before it goes away completely.

Recommended if you don't mind abusing your metabolism a bit once in awhile!

______________________________________________________________
EDITED TO ADD:

This was a review of the Zingers before they met their demise.  A subsequent commenter has indicated the post-death revived zinger...I am calling them the Zombie Zingers... apparently do not have the same taste.  Not that they were technically 'good' in the accurate sense of the word, but if you are selling nostalgia it does not bode well if the recipe is changed.  Next time i see a Zombie Zinger I will buy it, eventually eat it, and update my own opinion.  For, now the review stands for the pre-Zombie version as that is what I had at the time.  (And thank you to the commenter who brought this to my attention).
______________________________________________________________

NEW EDIT 10.27.13----all I can say is UGH.  The Zombie Zinger sucks rocks.  I added a box to an order on a whim and couldn't even eat a whole one it had such a yucky aftertaste.  My children liked it okay and so did my spousal unit, but personally...bleck.  Nothing like the 'last box' I'd gotten back when I wrote this review initially.  I'm dropping the stars to 3...maybe it's like cilantro, only certain people can taste the yuck.

Eh, they were ok.;neutral
This popcorn is okay, but it would be so much better with butter. I can't find any decent pre-popped popcorn on Amazon, and the only good popcorn I have been able to find has too much salt. I don't know why popcorn like this rarely has butter or butter flavoring. And as this popcorn has very little salt, it has very little flavor. I am not sure why all the other reviewers love it, but I don't. I say, if you are more ambitious than me, make your own and put some salt and lots of butter on it. It will be much better than this.;neutral
All of Oskri's products are all very well made.  The only reason for giving this product a low score is because I do not care for the taste of the bars.  I love the almond and cranberry bars, but these Quinoa Bars....not so much.;neutral
"I've used Tellicherry peppercorns for years that I normally ordered from Penzy's Spices.  These peppercorns are good - just not quite as robust as the ones I've ordered in the past.  I don't need as many herbs and spices as I used to since my family has gone from 5 to just 1 so I was looking for an ""add on"" item from Amazon.  These are good - just not stellar.";neutral
Came super runny and separated. I had to toss it in the fridge for an hour whip it with the kitchen aid and toss in the fridge again to get the consistency I needed. I added Bavarian cream emulsion to it as well to give it better flavor. It wasn't bad but it wasn't good.;neutral
The flavor was great.  The only reason for 3 stars is because the oil separates it makes opening really difficult and you REALLY need to kneed the package to prevent oil spilling out.  And it's kinda hard to get all the butter out w/out using a knife.;neutral

I had got my bag of pumpkin seeds today they taste good,BUT One thing i read on the bag and my packing slip that they are chinese Pepitas,if i had known i would not have ordered this product. They say it is made in USA,,,,BEWARE,and there is no exp.date anywhere.;neutral
"I received this item today bundled together in a way where I could not see the expiration date without cutting the plastic which bundled the 6 boxes together.  Mine expire 8/30 (today is 5/7).  I know that if I bought these in the store I would have at least a couple or more months of shelf life.  That said I should be able to get through them before the end of their shelf life and I would finish the rest even if they go over.  What is not cool is that the majority of groceries I have bought here are not nearly as fresh as those I would get a the store.  When I buy groceries here I expect them to be fresh, and considering Amazon's size I can't think of an excuse for getting products that have been sitting on a shelf for months.  I was unable to return (if I wanted to go to the trouble) these since they are not ""not eligible for return.""

I gave these 2 stars for the actual product which is pretty good, but also sweet which needs to be considered if you are on a special diet.  I sometimes add them to my breakfast when I can't get something better.";neutral
"Ended up with a case of the Stephen's chocolate rasberry and a case of the Stephen's French Vanilla
""cocoa.""  I really wanted to believe the 100% positive feedback on here, but you should never believe
what you read, right?
I guess the 1st thing I look for in a cocoa is that the liquid has some body to it. This seemed just
watery and weak....it looks like a no-fat soymilk.
I added MORE than the recommended amount for the serving size and it was still just so-so.

I am just not impressed with the way the powder globbed together and clumped and stuck to the spoon~yuk.
$5 a can for 12 serving when you can get the packets of the standard cocoa for 99 cents on sale for
the same amount of servings?
Granted, Amazon's price is better than the manufactures website since there is NO shipping through
here and shipping is at a premium through Stephen's Gourmet.
I would say unless you have tried this somehow elsewhere first, do not bother wasting your money to buy
6lbs of cocoa mix at one time. You might end up doing what I will have to do when you don't like it.
sigh
give it away~";neutral
I bought these to drink as a quick soup/broth.  It does have a more realistic chicken taste than the cubes and powders I have used in the past, but I find that there is a peculiar sweet undertone/aftertaste when I drink it straight.  When seasoned with some cayenne it is not noticeable, however, and makes for a tasty broth.;neutral
a lot of broken cookies;neutral
OK but wouldn't buy it again.;neutral
I love organic valley products, and I buy this cheese for the fact that it is theirs and the convenience of getting it from Amazon fresh. However, I don't prefer it to the kind from the deli at the grocery store. Obviously, though, it's heads and shoulders above the kraft in the jar kind, but I imagine if you're thinking of buying this, that isn't your comparison. That said, though, I almost always have some of it in the fridge as a backup, though;neutral
Smells amazing when it is brewing but certainly doesn't taste as good as it smells, unfortunately.  I love dark coffee so I am accustomed to a certain bitterness which I usually like, but something about this flavor as well as another Starbucks flavor I have tried, have an awesome aroma but a very bitter flavor.;neutral
While I love the idea of adding this to my noodles while camping, I was a little disappointed with the taste.  There were A LOT of carrots and it seemed salty/strong tasting (definitely couldn't add to much to my ramen without creating an overpowering taste).  Would prefer to have no flavoring so I can eat more of the mix.  Also, I found that I had to simmer the vegetables to soften them - was hoping I could just add boiling water, but they were still a bit crunchy after a couple of minutes of adding boiling water.;neutral
Who doesn't like pop tarts?! I bought a box of these since they were at such a great deal and I have to say I've had enough for quiet awhile! I could buy maybe 24 pop tarts for the price I bought this 48-count box for on Amazon so it is a great deal! However, the downside is that almost every pack was crumbled and the pop tarts weren't whole, I'm assuming during shipping and UPS not knowing what's inside the box they just throw them in the truck. I will be donating the unopened boxes I have left to a local homeless shelter as I figure they could be happy to have a broken crumbled pop tart than no food at all.;neutral
I can't say I'm a big fan of these chips. It's an odd combination, chocolate and tortilla chips. I was hoping for something sweeter but it is not. The flavors are at odds with each other and that made it hard for me to enjoy. I ended up giving the rest of the bags away because they are just not my thing.;neutral
"I quite like tea, and I usually make my own blends using loose leaf ingredients.  However, I like to have the occasional cup of tea at work, and bagged tea is much more convenient there.  So, I decided to poke around Amazon and see what was available that looked interesting.  Thus, I came upon Twinings Honeybush, Mandarin and Orange tea.

I love honeybush by itself, and have drank plenty of it loose leaf, so I imagined this tea would be quite good.  However, after brewing someIm not impressed.  I cant taste the honeybush at all!  It should have a strong, fruity, and somewhat distinct flavor, but none of that is present.  Also, I know its not being covered up by the orange flavoring because that is rather weak.  In fact, the tea tastes of weak artificial orange flavor (almost reminiscent of orange jello) andnothing.  Ive been using it as a passable iced tea, but its certainly not good hot.

Overall, Im pretty disappointed in this tea  for having honeybush listed as the first ingredient, it has surprisingly little flavor to show for it.  Ill use it up as iced tea, but I certainly won't be buying it again.";neutral
I was hoping this would be a nice coffee substitute but alas no. I have to use 2 packets for one cup in order to achieve a robust flavor which makes this way too expensive to reorder. The Vanilla and Hazelnut were good however I probably won't finish the chocolate or robust flavors. for me, Teeccino Coffee is just okay.;neutral
"It tasted like most canned chili or tamales, as far as flavor goes. There were nice chunks of potatoes and yams in it but I expected a more ""gourmet"" taste after having other varieties of this brand of soup and really enjoying them.  this one isn't great.";neutral
Love these k-cups! The were the perfect home-run: excellent strong flavor, free and fast shipping, and the price used to be great. Now they cost  over .20 cents  more per k-cup. Barrie House Blend Extra Bold used to be my favorite k-cup, but now I'm switching. That's why I gave 3 stars. The company seems great too, they give you a freebie in each order. I've gotten a couple free travel coffee cups and some free samples. If price comes back, I will too.;neutral
only good ones are honey mustard;neutral
Be aware that you receive two bags, so this can be quite costly compared with what you may be able to secure locally. The seeds are larger than other brands Ive tried, but many simply still cannot be opened and the seed itself eaten, so unless you are okay with eating the entire seed and shell, you may wish to pass. Know that the seeds of course are extremely slippery once they get wet so be prepared for that, too, if you try to split them with the front of your teeth.;neutral
Healthy but Just too dry for me.;neutral
Very good cereal, but just as other reviews say, it is ridiculous how little food there is in each container.  It is only about 1/2 full when it is heated up.  It is rather expensive for such a small amount of food.  It's unfortunate, because if they gave us some more food, I'd buy these endlessly.;neutral
nah;neutral
Vague flavor of cherry.;neutral
"ok; but too soft and too sweet.";neutral
OK FOR THE PRICE ....;neutral
Smaller than Expected, but Okay. The chocolate was very tasty and the peanuts... well they were peanuts. Surprisingly, I didn't care for the other stuff so much until AFTER I tried something after being refrigerated. Then, everything tasted much better. At first, I would have given it one star, but after refrigeration -- I'm giving it three. Four stars if it had been bigger and/or less costly. Not worth $29.95 in my opinion. Won't buy again due to price vs. size.;neutral
IT WILL DO IF THERE IS NOTHING ELSE IN THE HOUSE. I thought it tasted funny, so I made it a point dat I will not buy dis stuff again!! I swear, they take out the salt and I feel its the salt that's making it somewhat more edible.;neutral
The Cashew and Ginger Spice bars have small pieces of candied ginger mixed throughout which gives them a nice spicy, ginger taste. The problem is that there needs to be more ginger. As it is, every other bite is just sort of bland, because there isn't any ginger. These are good, but theyd be great with just a few more pieces of ginger.;neutral
"No artificial colors, artificial flavors or preservatives.

I bought these for my father to use with his insta-hot water tap in his kitchen. He said the flavor of the coffee was as expected but these were really hard to position on the cup in order to fill. The paper flaps on the side barely hold it onto the cup without it slipping down into the cup and spilling grinds. We were able to hold it in place but it seems like a lot of work, and a high price per cup for just a single serving.;neutral
I think this product is good for trying a ton of different coffees, HOWEVER, it has one full tray of teas which I was not expecting, nor was I expecting so many Decaf coffee cups. I did not appreciate that as now I have like 25 extra cups of Decaf.;neutral
"You could use this as the base of a dessert with lemon curd and some whipped cream or custard, but on its own, it really is very soft - not crunchy or chewy.

Peppermint is a fun flavor of cocoa to have at the holidays. Unfortunately, this brand is REALLY sweet, which is why I gave it three stars. I mixed it with a bit of Ghirardelli cocoa mix to cut the sweetness and added a bit of milk to the mug before pouring in the boiling water, and got the right flavor. If you love your peppermint cocoa super-duper-sweet then this is the brand for you.;neutral
I ordered this one and a few other ones as well... these took forever to come in (over a month) and they look a lot like dead sunflowers with cheap flowers have been hot-glued in the center. makes really good, light tea.  good for personal use, not as a gift.;neutral
The price was right and the caramel smell was very strong when I opened the box. However when brewing the coffee it just comes out with a very faint caramel flavor. Still good coffee just not much caramel flavor.;neutral
These Hawaiian rolls are the best, however, once frozen they lose it's soft fluffiness (one of the most desirable things about this bread). But if that doesn't bother you- then they are pretty good. They also make very good slider rolls.;neutral
Nice to rub on skin;neutral
I give it three stars because it taste so good, but after buying 6 bottles I'm tired of the extraordinary settling, sometimes the jar ends up only being half full after stirring, it's expensive enough but to skimp this much on what is put in each jar is unethical. I buy almond butter from another company that has similar texture to this and never had this kind of settling. Customer service was rude and said I was incorrect and stated that it doesn't settle that much and did nothing to help.;neutral
I bought this as I am trying to avoid sorbitol, which causes flatulence.  This can be a problem on flights, especially the long international ones. I chew gum during takeoff and landing to help keep my ears from plugging up.  This gum tastes good at first, but the flavor and sweetness dissipates very quickly.  Besides, sugar is not good for one, so I will use this only for flying.  It does the intended job, but that's all.;neutral
It's too small;neutral
"the older versions of Hamburger Helper were easier to make and only required water, guess they decided to save money and eliminate some of the components because ALL new versions of Hamburger Helper require milk.

Flavor is different from the original versions too, used to enjoy the Lasagna and other beef noodle type Hamburger Helper but none of the newer versions are as good as they used to be.

this sloppy joe mix is usually not available in grocery stores so it was the only way to buy it but I would not buy again, the newer versions of Hamburger Helper are of lesser quality.";neutral
Not that flavorful;neutral

Seems gritty to me.;neutral
These are ok. Yes they are healthy and that makes them somewhat bearable but other than the coconut or mango flavor I couldn't enjoy them. I love that they have tons of chia seeds which fill you up quickly and sustain you for a long time but if they had a better flavor I would like them more. They are chewy which I prefer to crunchy. The acai berry made me want to hurl. Work on the flavors though-;neutral
Gives me really bad gas pains.;neutral
Didn't have enough peanuts. Also, didn't taste too sweet. Had more of a bland taste, with little are no sweet taste. I  always eat candy, from Old Dominion. And, usually I'm not disappointed. I assumed this would be the case with this item. But, unfortunately not. Don't think I will be ordering this item again.;neutral
McCormick has let me down on this one. I rarely purchase anything other that McCormicks and this time I really wish I had. Maybe in a different recipe it will be taste better, it smells great, but it has an aftertaste that leaves something to be desired.;neutral
Honestly not a fan. Its not terrible but its not good either, reminds me of the candy Now and Later (which isn't a good thing in my opinion). I really love the blueberry lite version, it was sold out so I thought I would try these. IMO there is just too much sugar, next time I will just wait for the other flavor to be available.;neutral
Bai Bubbles is a low calorie beverage with a non-sugar sweetener.  That said. It tastes like diet soda.  It is fruity, but flavors like grapefruit are almost nasty.  They got all the essence of grapefruit that I personally do not like... bitter, acrid taste, not the sweetness of pink grapefruit I was expecting.  The other flavors are better, but they ALL taste like diet soda and have that undescribable background taste that is a signature flavor for diet soda.;neutral
I really had high hopes for this creamer.  However, I found them to be on par with the other coconut/almond milk creamers at the grocery stores.  I could both taste and smell the coconut in these creamers.  Unfortunately for me, I'm going back to my Trader Joe's organic soy creamer which in my opinion provides better flavor.;neutral
"Tastes fantastic. However...

I read the name and then decided to purchase this product based on all the reviews. There were so many ""diabetic"" comments, that I just assumed it was Splenda brown, a brown sugar substitute. Shame on me for not reading the ingredients or even the description before purchase. The first ingredient is SUGAR. This is not a sugar substitute! It's real brown sugar (sugar + molasses) which has been ""blended"" with Splenda. For those of you who cannot have sugar of any kind, please read your ingredient lists!

I feel like the brand Splenda is very recognizable - the logo, the packaging colors, etc. I associate it with sugar substitute not real sugar, and therefore feel a little misled that this contains real sugar as the first ingredient. My suggestion is that Splenda rebrand their sugar ""blends"" with a different look, as not to confuse consumers.

5 stars for flavor, 1 star for a bag of real sugar wearing the Splenda name. Combined rating 2.5 stars.";neutral
I liked that this was natural and a good price and low fat.  However, it often wouldn't completely dissolve and sometimes left a kind of weird sludge in the bottom of the cup.  Maybe if you used extremely hot boiling water or less of the mix it would dissolve better.;neutral

This spice is nice.;neutral
Not great coffee beans but not bad [just 'meh']. I found this coffee to be very weak tasting even though it appeared to be fresh smelling and looking. I've had worse coffee and far better. Good price though. I would have loved to love this coffee.;neutral
"This is my first time trying dry roasted nuts. I'm blown away. These are phenomenal. I love them. I will never buy regular roasted again and I love regular roasted, unsalted cashews, but these are even better.
I opened the bag and could not stop eating them.
11/2017 - Updated Review. This time these dry roasted cashews were over roasted and there was a peculiar after-taste. These are very expensive - used to be $19.00/2lbs, now $27.00 - for this price, they should be perfect. I did email Oh! Nuts about the quality this time.";neutral
"This stuff is on the slight bitter side.  It's not bad per se, I like bitter but this spice did not seem 'rounded' and pleasant on its own to me.  There's no aftertaste that I can detect and my food still tastes good using it, but I can tell it's not the usual brand I buy.

I bought this to get bulk for the money since I blow through Turmeric at a ridiculous rate.  I use A LOT of the stuff, in just about everything savory to assist with joint health and because I love the taste of turmeric.  I also love the color it imparts to food.  I will finish the package but will likely try another brand the next go around.

If I had to pick between having this and none, I would buy again.  Because of the price point, I likely will buy again, many times, just not as a first choice.

I will update this review after I've had a chance to try the tea recipes listed in other reviews.  It just might change my mind!  Hopefully I'll end up liking this better (it wouldn't be the first time that a product I didn't like at first ended up being my favorite goto so, we'll see).

Hope this helps.";neutral

Not as great as the reviews stated.  I was super excited to get these for my husband as a treat, because the reviews made it seem these were the best thing ever. However when my husband tried them (and he's not a picky guy at all) I could tell he wasn't impressed. Needless to say I was disappointed.  I tried a bite and it was true...they weren't bad...it's just that they were not great.  Kinda Blah.;neutral
I have subscribed to the original (not deluxe) Annie's Gluten Free Macaroni and Cheese dinner for over a year.  The sauce is light, creamy, 'customizable', and very tasty.  About a week ago, I decided to try out the deluxe macaroni and cheese dinner by Annie because the subscribe and save price was slightly cheaper and possessed roughly the same amount of product.  To be frank, the sauce is completely different.  I am not sure how the recipe for the cheese sauce can vary so much between these two products, but I definitely taste a significant difference.  The deluxe cheese sauce tastes overly artificial and more like cheese whiz compared to that of the original version.  Perhaps the variance can be attributed to the fact that the deluxe version's sauce comes pre-made in a packet, whereas the regular version's sauce may be customized to your individual taste by tinkering with the amounts of butter/margarine and milk.  Either way, I am going back over to the regular GF Annie's macaroni dinner (it earns a  five star rating in my opinion!).;neutral
I foolishly assumed it was Pulse and regular Revv. I googled Pulse and it brought me here. I should have known when the 44 pack did not mention Pulse though I purchased the 22. It won't go to waste but disappointed no Pulse. It did't say it but the photo and google search lead me to believe it was there. I could not find a comment except someone actually saying they liked the Pulse. Oh well. Live and learn.;neutral
I was looking for a quick at work lunch that was not noodles.  This product appeared to be a good alternative.  And it would have been if it actually delivered as described.  First, you can achieve the proper texture but it takes a little experimenting with the amount of water and the microwave time.  The raisins are a nice addition.  I did not find it too salty and I am very sensitive to the amount of salt used in food.  The problem is the overall authenticity in taste is lacking.  it is under seasoned. I do not consider it a complete loss as it will be consumed at work when other lunch alternatives are not availabe.  However, given that it is a little pricey and not all that tasty, I will not reorder this product.;neutral
I bought this one because it was cheap and I know the difficult process of growing vanilla beans makes vanilla expensive.  So I shouldn't have  expected quality.  The powder was very dry and gritty.  Not really what I was looking for.;neutral
I bought this based on reviews. The smell didn't wow me. The taste is confusing. Its not thin mint as some described. I could say its thin mint gone terribly wrong. Its just not good but not the worst thing I ever tasted. I wouldnt purchase again.;neutral
This is a good product, but in no way does it contain the amount of pistachio nuts pictured on the box. Really these guys should be more honest with the packaging by noting the candies are not representative of the actual product. The taste is good but I'm not reordering as I feel a bit cheated.;neutral
Different!!!;neutral
"This stock arrived quickly and in good condition. The vendor managed the transaction well.

I am sorry to say that this mushroom stock didn't taste like anything, I cannot discern any taste. Other flavors of this brand that I have gotten had some taste as well as a lot of salt. Their low sodium versions were also salty to my taste.

These are fine, and readily available in my area, and don't have MSG like their flagship product does.  However they do have added sugars, sneakily listed in the ingredient list, which isn't great.  Planters, can we have some lightly salted, non-MSG, non-sugared peanuts?  I'd put them on my subscribe and save right away.;neutral
I had never heard of this product before, but it came highly recommended by a friend. Sadly, I hated the taste of the cookies I made. It has a lingering aftertaste. I then tried it in my coffee, and was equally as disappointed. Trying it on your finger is a very different result then baking with it. I gave it away to my mother.;neutral
Very great product love the taste;neutral
I thought these would be a good buy but once I got them there were far too many peanuts inside the container it says LESS than 50% peanuts, seems like 49.99%.  After nothing the number of peanuts, I began to count the other types of nuts and it was sad, there were 6-8 pecans (some in parts), 2 1/2 Brazil nuts, 10-14 cashews (some in parts), there were quite a few almonds (very small ones, I have never seen almonds that small), but it was the peanuts that were overwhelming.  Even so, I had not decided to cancel my subscription until yesterday when I found another brand of Mix Nuts with NO peanuts inside and for $3 less, so of course, I decided they were a far better buy.;neutral

This is sadly a mixed review. With all of the really wonderful looking produce that arrived with our Amazon Fresh order, the asparagus looked a little sad. We felt sorry for it and kept it and put it through it's paces in the kitchen with lemon, garlic, salt and pepper. And it was surprisingly good, given that it looked a bit forlorn when it arrived. Was it the tenderest asparagus I've ever had? No, there was a tad more chewing involved. On the other hand, I happily ate what was on my plate and sort of wished there was more... so there you go.;neutral
We recently ordered six different nut-butter products.  Not one had enough solids.  All have way too much oil.  The peanut butter makers have it right, with a high level of solids and less oil or fat.  Hopefully we will be able to remove the oil from our new butter products and have nice sandwiches.;neutral
Of all the t-disc choices, this one if pretty good if you like a full 6 oz of coffee that's not weak and is competitively priced (under .50 a disk including shipping, tax etc.).  Although there are some better choices out there for a dark brew for the Tassimo  (e.g., the Tassimo extra bold roast which was similiar in boldness to Star$), they are very pricey (double the price of these disks).  Bed, Bath and Beyond used to have decent prices for the t-disks after applying their store coupons, but they recently jacked up their prices to almost $11.00 per package and they reduced their selection of t-disks (they no longer sell the Tassimo bold roasts). Hate to say it, but I think the days for the Tassimo machine are numbered (sort of like owning a Betamax machine....).;neutral
Too sweet, like eating candy.;neutral
I was disappointed to discover that once mixed, the tablespoon value of end product required 3 times the quantity to make a sandwich, meaning those label values are multiplied times 3.  I might as well just eat regular peanut butter when I figured up the caloric difference and carbs and sugar.  The taste was good on toast, so I've gone back and given product an extra star for that.;neutral
I didn't care for the taste and texture very much.  It's not that sweet and it's not as smooth as I expect from a lollipop.  On the other hand, I bought them to give to kids, and the kids have not complained.;neutral

"I'm not really as crazy about this as I'd hoped I'd be.  I wanted something to replace the peanut butter I'd started using in my smoothies.  I wanted the protein and the flavor but hoped to avoid some of the fat.  I should have known better, I expect.  The fat carries the flavor, and to get as much peanut flavor from this powder as I would from peanut butter I'd have to use twice as much by volume at least.  That means I'm not really avoiding much of anything.

However, the protein it gives me is solid, and the price is good, so I'm sticking with it.  It won't replace PB, but it's not a bad choice.";neutral

"I purchased this Revv coffee k-cups to have some coffee with a little extra kick for those mornings I have to peel my eyelids open to stay awake.  This coffee is VERY BITTER tasting.  I have gotten through 1 22 count box only because I didn't want to waste the money but I won't purchase this again.  You definitely have to like super strong and bitter tasting coffee in order to enjoy Revv.  The other thing is I really didn't feel any difference in my energy level.  The whole reason for purchasing this was for the extra energy and I really didn't notice any difference.  So my experience with this as far as ""revving"" up my energy is that it doesnt.  Again, if you like strong, bold, bitter coffee than you will like this.  But if you are just trying it for the energy and don't necessarily enjoy strong, bold, and bitter coffee than this is not for you.";neutral
Fun but if I had to do it over, I'd only buy one box.  The bad ones are so disgusting that you'll be done trying them pretty quick.  :-)  Oddly, one of the boxes had only three colors in it: no green or blue.  So if you think you'll get a sampling of every flavor in each box, think again.  That was my main disappointment.  I knew some would be nasty so no problem there.  Just wish they'd distribute them more evenly.;neutral
Well, it's definitely a gram of fine quality saffron (aromatic and potent and quite flavorful when used in your paellas or what-have-you) but you will be snickering when you see the size of the bottle it comes in.

If you are easily dismayed by spending a certain amount of money and then receiving something practically microscopic in return, you might want to rethink this. But a gram of saffron is a gram of saffron, I guess.;neutral
I bought these hoping they would provide a year-round substitute for the seasonal product Archer Farms puts out at Target before Christmas.  These are only okay, where those nuts are delicious.

It's good, but not great.  That full-bodied, aromatic, distinctive ""Kona"" flavour is mild compared to other brands I've tried ... BUT, this is the first time I've purchased GROUND Kona coffee.

When the supply is browned (I guess from egg yolk brushed on the surface, and then placed under a grill towards the end of the backing process), it is very appealing.

I have tried fruit crisps from other brands and somehow they tasted better than these. Although the ingredients are pretty much the same: 100% Fruit, No additives, preservatives, dyes, or added sugars, I can't point out what makes the taste different.

I really like the tomato basil flavor but I also like onion so I decided to give this version of lentil snaps a try.

Note to company: you might draw a panel from these reviewers and send us each a tablespoon of new attempts at bacon to rate until you come up with something that really tastes like bacon- I volunteer-I'd love to see this improved.

The picture in the description makes these truffles look nice, and I planned on giving the box to a friend as a birthday present.  However, the container is made of extremely flimsy white cardboard and not suitable for gift giving.  It seems like a miracle that the candies were not crushed to a pulp because the box arrived severely bent out of shape and was also half open.  So I had to find another present for my friend.  The only advantage was that this way I got to enjoy the truffles which was not the idea.  I would rate the truffles themselves as worthy of 5 stars, but the false advertising of the box brings them down to 3 at the most.;neutral

Edit 4/19/13- I usually base a hot sauce on how it tastes straight from a spoon. Well I guess that's stupid because that's not how I use hot sauce. I put it on food like most people. I do like this on tacos. It's still not my favorite but I enjoy it enough to have used it in large quantities probably 4 times this week.

- Super hydrate...and fast.
- Cures acid reflux/indigestion in less than a minute. Insane.
- Probably excellent for athletes, trainees, and those who sweat a lot
- Believable pH levels compared to tap(crap) water

I have been searching for good bottled water to drink. I really liked Evian and probably should stick with that. I put Evian in my coffee maker and it really brought out the taste of my K-cup Folgers. And...my cats took to Evian.

Love the beans, better taste than Libby's organic canned pintos.  I deducted 2 stars for half the cans being dented every time which makes them hard to open.  Since they are shrink-wrapped a dozen on a cardboard base with dents on the inside, it looks like dented cans are rejects at the factory which are gathered up to ship together.

"If you are a serious tea drinker, the kind that pays attention to every little detail in terms of water temperature and steeping time, you will have the patience for this tea.

When it comes to the coaxing the best flavor, there is very little room for error.
As with all green tea, the water needs to be under a boil. Too hot and it will taste like a clump of sod. Steep it too long and it taste like a clump of sod that has some weeds in it along with grass. And not in a good way.

"This coffee is difficult for me to rate. Do I rate it for what it is or do I rate it for what I had expected and hoped it might be? First the facts of the beans in the bag...

This is a good quality medium dark (at least full city+ and maybe even a light Vienna*) roast coffee. Beans are of uniform size with very few broken/fractured beans in the bag which indicates some care has been taken in handling throughout the selection/grading/roasting process. The roast is even with no burnt beans and no really light beans. There is a light oil sheen present, but not too oily and certainly not the kind of grinder-clogging oil slick (which some people mistake as a sign of quality when what it really is -- especially with roasts that are not full on dark -- is a sign of coffee that is either not very fresh or roasted too quickly at too high a temp or some combination of the two.)

After receiving this coffee I loaded up a portion into my burr grinder and ground enough to pull an espresso. First attempt at the same grinder setting I had been using for a lightly roasted Panama Boquete choked my espresso machine, likely because the slight oil sheen to this Kona blend results in a more solid pack when tamped. No worries. Dialed the grinder back a click or two and went again. Right on the money with a 25 second pull. The results in the cup showed a really nice crema, tiger-stripey and rich looking. No complaints there. So, how did it taste? Here's where things get difficult with deciding how to rate.

Kona coffee is typically very mellow, medium-roasted (to city/city+ or even full city) with low to medium low acid and a really rich, creamy mouth feel. A good Kona blend would be expected to try to come as close to the typical Kona profile as possible by blending Kona Island beans with less expensive beans in an effort to deliver a similar result to pure Kona but at a lesser price. And on this count the Jermiah's Kona blend is, for me, a real disappointment. It is not mellow and it lacks the ""sweetness"" expected of a Kona. It is a coffee of a fairly dark flavor profile (at least full city+) and is more acidic than expected. So as a value priced attempt to recreate a Kona-like coffee in a blend, it is (for me) far wide of the mark.

If you're looking for a medium dark coffee flavor profile with medium acid that is bold in the cup rather than mellow and ""sweet"", this coffee may be for you. If you are looking for a reasonably priced alternative to a full Kona that has the same mellow characteristics (which is what I had hoped for), you may find yourself like me, which is to say disappointed.

It's not bad coffee. It's just not what I had hoped for in a Kona blend. If I rate it for the medium dark, medium acid rather bold coffee it is rather than medium to medium light roasted, mellow, low to medium low acid alternative to a pure Kona I had expected and hoped it would be, it would be a solid four stars. Maybe 4 and a half. But rating it as a Kona blend? In that regard I'll make it a three star coffee...because I can't give it two and a half.

These bars are very sweet.  For me, there is too much sugar, too many calories, and not enough protein.  There are other bars that fit my needs better.  If, however, you are just looking for a slightly better than candy bar type snack, this may work for you.  The taste is good, very sweet and you can really taste the honey.;neutral
"I purchased the Dandelion Dark Roast 10-pack as an add-on; tried it today for the first time. Probably my last. Brewed just one bag at the get go and I was thoroughly disappointed with the taste, or rather the LACK thereof. I let it steep even longer and cool off a bit and tried again -  still nothing, just a vague cabob flavor, not unpleasant, but not exciting by a long shot. Added another bag to what was left in my mug (most of it), hoping it would be stronger, maybe. Not any better. Finally added a little tequila to it since I was having a breakfast burrito, and that made it drinkable at least. Not sure what I'm going to do with the remaining 8 bags - maybe combine them with herbal tea or something, if I feel inspired to do so. Who knows.

Okay...Update: 4/26: Felt like trying this again today. Used two of them, steeped about 6 minutes (covered, so it wouldn't get cold), then tasted it. Still not very good. Added some Silk Vanilla Almond Milk (just a little), and tasted it again. Surprise, surprise - pretty decent.";neutral

This is a nice product but a stronger flavor than agave. It isn't the type of sweetener I would care to use in tea or coffee. It is a good topping for pancakes or using in baking. Of course, this is my taste for sweeteners. Not my favorite but good.;neutral

These are edible but kind of chewy. They have good flavor, but have more carbs than I wanted. They wrap well, and don't tear easily and they do have less carbs than a regular wrap, but the price being what it is, I probably won't order them again.;neutral
Well packaged, but not so practical.  It's packaged in a silver plastic sealed bag (within the can) that you need to cut open. In the prices you lose some matcha powder.

"While I like the texture and heft of all the Dare brand sandwich cookies, this flavor was a little lacking.

The cream is smooth and silky, the cookies thick and slightly soft. The shape is cute. However, I found the maple flavor to be way too light. I tried the coconut and lemon at the same time and the maple was by far the lightest flavored.

They are good cookies but if you need a maple fix maybe try tapping something a little closer to the source.";neutral
I really like the tomato flavor in these wraps.  But as much as I love mango, this one is a touch too sweet for for me.  It would help if it had more spice, but I really didn't pick up any chipotle flavor from the wrap.  I think these are more suited to very specific purposes...a very spicy jerk chicken or sauce or anything with a nice hit of heat would probably be nice.  And a sauce with some definite tang or a spritz of lemon or lime juice.  Once I can play around with combos, this will probably get better.  But I think I'll stick to the tomato when I order again.  These would probably be great as a dessert wrap if you like that sort of thing.;neutral
Initially, I was surprised when I looked at the color chart and saw that for 2 cups of icing it required 60 drops of the blue icing plus 1 drop of black to end up with royal blue!  That is a LOT of coloring.  I used this for royal icing and it did take a LOT but I ended up with a beautiful royal blue icing that didn't have a bitter taste. I was really pleased until I noticed that even a small bite resulted in stained tongue and teeth.  I realize that is inevitable and I am used to it but this was SO extreme and lasted SUCH a long time that it was unacceptable - the cookies I was decorating were for my husband's coworkers and who wants to walk around with a stained mouth?  I ended up scraping the cookies and trashing the icing.  For the next batch, I added a few drops with other blues that didn't cause the same staining.  I haven't really experimented with the other colors but beware of the blue!;neutral

I did have some success with it in savory foods where I might normally add a little cream as well as in some pasta sauces.";neutral
"It's low in calories, 1 net carb but not sure what it tastes like. IT DOES NOT TASTE like Maple syrup. It tastes like Monk Fruit. I ordered 4 with high hopes. I will choke down those four but no more. It has the calories and carbs going for it, which convinced me over the others.

I recently started adding Goji berries to my morning oatmeal for their sweetness. I also love to add Goji berries to hot water and sip as a tea. While these berries are the largest I've seen, their taste is not as good as others that I've tried. They have almost a chalky taste and they're not quite as fresh. Eating them with my oatmeal covers up the chalky taste, but I won't be making tea with them.;neutral
"While I'm a big fan of Wild Planet Tuna and Wild Planet Sardines, the shrimps were a disappointment to me. I simply didn't like the taste, and no matter how I tried to mask it (in salads, mixing with mayonnaise, lemon, lots of pepper, etc) it is still too strong, too ""fishy"" and a far cry from fresh shrimp. Maybe it's just how canned shrimp is supposed to taste, I still trust the brand, but I'll pass the shrimp - I would much rather buy shrimp occasionally from my local grocery store.

On the positive side, they're sustainably caught and the cans contain minimum amounts of BPA. Although I didn't like the taste and smell, it didn't seem to be anything off with the shrimps, they were a good color, good texture, with only occasional bits of shell and guts.

That being said, I wish I had tried one can before ordering a pack of 12; this is certainly an acquired taste and you might want to make sure you got it before ordering in bulk.";neutral
not so fond of this one;neutral
I had this in my subscribe and save but am going to have to cancel it. We love this variety except the honey mustard pretzels. These are gross! We like honey mustard but it's like a dry powder and not good at all. I just tossed at least 10 bags of honey mustard that had been piling up in my kitchen. I hope they will offer another aridity box soon without the honey mustard & onion flavor. We live pretzels and I only buy chips in small bags anymore. I got tired of throwing the big bags away when we didn't eat them fast enough. Sadly with this variety I still waste a lot of pretzels.;neutral

I love this candy. Allsorts have always been a favorite of mine and bassets used to be available on supermarket shelves commonly. They apparently priced themselves out of the supermarkets. At about 10 dollars a pound it is way overpriced. A slightly lower quality of the same candy can be had for about 25 percent to thirty percent of what they charge here. Two stars off for lack of value. For ten dollars a pound you can get some really good steak.  Check economy candy online for the better bargain. This was fresh and the quality was good but i think it was not worth the cost and will stick with the cheaper stuff until i hit the lottery.;neutral

This mix contains a variety of small tasty bits of snackers. I particularly like the cheetos, although there aren't enough - in my opinion.

Amazon as well as Manitoba Harvest were very accommodating and sent a replacement order.  I was not charged for the first order.  The replacement was better but still had lots of husks.  I've purchased other hemp hearts in the health food store and there are no husks at all so this was a bit disappointing.  If you don't mind the taste or texture of having them in there, then it's a great deal.";neutral

"We'd gotten these beans before, and they're excellent quality with fine taste, particularly for the cost per pound.

So they're sitting on the shelf right now and we're drinking other kinds of coffee that don't give my wife nausea, pain, or heartburn.

If you have a sensitive stomach, be careful. If you don't, give 'em a try.";neutral
The product is good, I'm just not pleased with the price increases.  I have gotten these on subscribe and save for the last several months and the price has gone up by $6.

I expected Hellfire and damnation but what I got was some hot chili pepper heat.  I like hot stuff but not Dave's Insanity hot.  I like to taste the flavor along with the heat.

I can add a rounded tea spoon of this to a bowl of Ramen noodle soup and it's kinda hot but mostly it just turns it red/orange.

"So, this product was purchased in my ongoing quest to make healthier choices for foods to eat on work days.
I adore lentils and am a fan of curry flavors, so I thought this would be a good fit. It also has 200 calories per cup.

It's actually pretty tasty IF you manage to prepare it properly, but that's the catch- It overflows easily if microwaved. It takes a long time for the lentils and curry to absorb properly so you don't end up with a weird, crunchy bugs and sand texture. The flavor is a nice, subtle curry. Not spicy, which is frustrating because I am a spicy lover and I keep buying foods on amazon with a curry flavor which don't turn out to have the spicier, face melting curry flavor I'm hoping for.

This product makes a very nice soup starter if you want to add some veggies and hot sauce and cook it on the stove. But as a quick meal to prepare and eat on your lunch break, it's kind of fail.";neutral
The butter flavor is very strong  YUM..However the salt (Himalayan Pink Salt) is so strong it overpowers the butter flavor.  I would say there is  three times the salt in comparison to regular butter.  I will not buy it again, but I will try another flavor of the same brand.;neutral
"I enjoy Snapple iced tea, especially the peach flavor so I was excited to try the K-Cup version. Unfortunately, the K-Cup concentrate doesn't quite measure up to the real thing.

Great idea though. I love being able to brew a cup of cold tea over ice while at work. I just wish it wasn't so sweet and actually tasted the same as bottled Snapple.";neutral

It makes your coffee foamy, but the flavor is disappointingly bland. I asked a friend to guess the flavor, and they could only taste what seems like an  artificial sweetener aftertaste.

Additionally they are organic and thus we don't need to get weary about the nasty stuff as much (I know organic produce also has some pesticides but relative to the conventional ones they are much safer.) They offer great value in combination with the amazon subscribe and save program too. Finally, Muir Glen offers their produce in BPA free cans in contrast to many other canned food producer and you can see it with your own eyes: The inside of the can is golden colored while the BPA lined ones are silver colored.

However, despite all these positive aspects, I can not give more than three stars to this specific product. It tastes pretty sour and that  has ruined our pizza experience for the time we insisted using this product. Even the kids don't like it and it really means something if kids reject pizza... Finally we gave it up and now over ten cans are sitting in our cupboard waiting for a good use. (any advice that would remove the nasty sharp sour taste is more than welcome in the comments section.)

In our pizzas, we replaced it with the regular muir glen tomato paste and it worked fantastic. Here is my own recipe: 1 can (6 ounces) of muir glen tomato paste + 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar + 1 tbsp olive oil + 2 tsp sugar + 1 tsp garlic powder + 1 tsp dried onion powder + some pizza seasoning (basil + oregano) + 1/4 tsp salt + water until it reaches to ketchup consistency.

This syrup tastes like someone melted a bunch of red hot candies and even a 1/2 pump was enough to completely overwhelm a 12oz coffee. One star off for the artificially flavored candy taste. The syrup also arrived wrapped in plastic and dented up pretty badly. When I have ordered the syrups from other vendors on Amazon they arrived in nice Amoretti boxes which included a recipe booklet and coupon, this did not have the original Amoretti packaging but did, thankfully, include the pump. Lack of original packaging and dented up as a result: loss of a second star. Would I purchase other Amoretti premium syrups? Absolutely! Would I repurchase the cinnamon one? Not at all. You're better of just putting actual ground cinnamon in your drink.;neutral

"Flavors too blended: the distinctive differences in taste between GREEK green, black, and kalamata aren't that discernible.  I like the brine, and it blends all three flavors such that any of the olives tastes like any other.  Maybe the differences in taste will 'bloom' when cold or hot?  They are all pitted.

Will keep in my fridge despite directions.  Top is two-part, plug and twist top.  You can't throw one of them away.

Next time will buy just one type of olive at a time.  But it's tasty, 'as is'.

It's still great water - but the plastic is now so flimsy that the bottles often don't stand straight, so a lot spills, and the caps don't fight tightly, so when a bottle tilts, it's almost guaranteed to spill.

From the nutritional stand point, I'm sure these seeds are excellent. However, they were not what I expected, which was a snack food like pumpkin seeds or sunflower seeds.

"I very much enjoy my canned hot dogs, and when I learned I could order them on-line, I was thrilled I could keep them in stock, ready whenever I wanted to eat a dog.

Previously I ordered Veja-Links, but I saw these and the price was better (much!). They appear the same price now, so it must have been my lucky day, but once I received my new hot dogs and tasted them, I was disappointed.

I was trying to find the ingredient list for the Linketts vs Veja-Links. One is Vegan and the other Vegetarian, and there is a difference, even in the liquid in the can. The Linketts are very soft and don't have a lot of taste. They just don't look as robust, either, a light pinkish/orange color (as is the liquid). They are more ""lean"", and from a healthy food aspect, I suppose that's for the best, but I eat my fake hot dogs for the taste. :) For me, this was a costly experiment, and the taste and texture are different enough to dislike the Linketts. I used to be able to eat these interchangeably, so I don't know if there have been manufacturing changes or not. I still have 10 cans to go.";neutral

I love Lindt Lindor chocolate truffles so I jumped on the chance to pick them up at a great price. However, when they arrived I opened them up and they had what looked to be a white film on them and the texture was off.

So not sure if these were on sale because they had some older cases they needed to get rid of.;neutral
"howdy y'all,

as others have pointed out, they added sugar to this. it makes it rather more sweet than i was expecting. dates are sweet on their own, so added sugar is ... rather startling.

other than that, these chopped dates are quite nice. too sweet for snacking, but pretty good when added to cold or hot cereal. since that's what i buy them for, i can live with the extra sugar.

rated a THREE since there is no significant plus or minus to this product. the added sugar comes perilously close to a minus one, tho.

take care,

Not sure what all the great reviews are about. I found the flavor odd though what I received was almost at the use by date. Noodle density was a little better than others I have tried.

Certainly not the best Earl Grey tea I have ever had seemed weak on the tea and a little heavy on the bergamot over powering any tea flavor. Maybe this box is old?  Might brew with Bigelow Earl Grey to use up in teapot. It would also be nice if they ditched the metal staples on the bags.;neutral

I use a lot of veggie broth powder as a staple of my cooking, and love being able to buy several jars at once here on Amazon.  Sadly, the last time I came for broth my favorite brand (Rapunzel) was out of stock, with no ETA on offering it again.  I bought the Seitenbacher sight unseen as it were (have never seen it offered locally so I couldn't taste test) based on all the positive reviews.  I guess it's okay but frankly I don't like it as much.  It doesn't dissolve as easily and the flavor is pretty drab in my opinion.  Fortunately [sic] I have to use a lot more of it to even get a flavor so I'll be done with this case before too long.  It's certainly better than MSG-ridden fakes and would be very handy to have if one is allergic to many things, being an entirely *acceptable* vegetarian broth.  But barring necessity, I would not choose this one first.;neutral
Great product, have to read description better, normally I avoid movie theater candy, inflated prices for snack sized amounts, it felt like going to the movies all over again, that sense you get while on a date with your girlfriend after visiting the concession stand, that 'I've just been screwed.' feeling.

I bought this because it was a decent price for the size of the container and it said it was gourmet popcorn. It is good popcorn, and I even got a whirrly popcorn popper to make it in.

"I bought these for baking and once they arrived, realized that they were not the baking kind of fruit at all. I guess I just did not pick up on the ""Crispy"" detail in the title. I thought they were just your average dried fruit that I could cut up and put in breads and cakes, but they are certainly not that, so do not make the same mistake with them that I did.
Otherwise, they are pretty nice. Now, as you might guess, I am an adult. So once I realize that I had a snack item on my hands, I decided to try it out in that capacity. That is where I became disenchanted with this product to some extent. The little packages of pears are not NEARLY enough for a snack for an adult. I have to eat 3 of them to feel like I got a snacks worth, and I am not a heavy eater. A whole candy bar is too much. A whole pear is almost too much, but these little packages are just not enough. The package says it holds the equivalent of one pear. My guess is, that these are mighty small pears.
They are nice and sweet though. That is the biggest positive about this item. The taste is GREAT. I really do like that part.
One reviewer mentioned that these tend to crumble easily and they do. About an eight of the product is at the bottom of the bag in a mess of crumbs. That is a disappointing factor. Since I had expected dried fruit, I guess I also expected that these snacks had a little more body to them than they do. The big pieces that hold together are quite good, but an awful lot of the product ends up at the bottom of the bag.
I finally gave these 3 stars. They taste good, but there is just not nearly enough product. It crumbles. It is an awful big package with very little in it. I would say that this is a snack for a 5 or 6 year old and not for an adult.
Well, that is my two cents on this product. Hope it helps you decide to buy or forgo. I will opt for regular dried pears myself. This is kind of an expensive hassle just to avoid eating the real fruit.";neutral
I like this sweetener, because it's the one that seems to trigger blood sugar spikes the least.  That being said, there's a bit of an aftertaste when baking with this one that I've not seen with some other products.  It's pretty good in hot beverages, though!;neutral
I got the 2 percent which was missing half the fat. That wasn't all that went missing in this version of Kraft Deluxe mac and cheese. It's actually not bad. It's just not very good. Compared to the other Deluxe offerings, the flavor is bland. The macaroni cooks up tender in eight minutes. Don't leave it too long, because unlike some of the other eblows in this series, this mac can overcook rather easily. The cheese sauce is very creamy and mine was definitely fresh. It's just so mild tasting it almost tastes like nothing. This is especially a problem if you are going to add anything to it, like the chicken and broccoli recommended on the box. This cheese sauce is not going to go very far without some doctoring. I added buffalo wing sauce to mine and it was much better. If you have a picky eater in the house, this might be a safe choice.;neutral
"After reading the reviews we jumped in with both feet and ordered this and the French Roast. Here's my take on the Fog Chaser after drinking all 36 cups:
* I prefer the French Roast, but I like a darker roast. This has a fruity undertone, similar to a Breakfast Blend, that I personally don't care for. But, my husband likes it and I find it drinkable.
* Don't be scared by the look, it's just a K-Cup without the plastic case. I love that this seems more eco-friendly.
* Okay, it's true, they smell a little funny. Not quite sure why they don't just smell like coffee, but who knows what other K-cups smell like without the plastic cover, right? Our solution was just not to smell them before brewing.
* The taste is pretty strong, and my first cup tasted bitter and not so great. We don't use sugar or sweeteners so there was nothing to mask the taste! But, like most new things, after a couple of cups over a couple of mornings I found the taste was fine, especially for the price. I don't know if I would serve this to company though, I like darker roasts but most people don't, and this is a little more bold than mild. There is a not-totally-pleasant aftertaste, but not enough to not drink it.
* I read a tip that said to prevent grounds in your cup, close the brewer lid slowly and gently. Works for us, we've had NO grounds in our cups.
So there we go, I'm ordering them again to take advantage of the Subscribe & Save option. I'm not going to say that this is the best coffee I've ever had, but for that 1st cup in the morning it's just fine.";neutral
This is not the worst dark chocolate I have had, but it is no where near the best either.  Very middle of the road flavor with too much fruitiness for my liking and much too sweet.

"I ordered this whole food product assuming that it must be an excellent source of dietary fiber. So I never bothered to view the ad's close-up photo image of its nutrition data. What a mistake. A serving size of 30g contains only 1 g of dietary fiber, and... 170 calories! So if you were to depend on this product for your entitire daily recommended 25g of dietary fiber, then you would have to consume 4250 calories of it.

BTW, I measured its bulk density using a digital weight scale that has an accuracy of 0.1 g. One quarter cup of it weighed 31.2 g = 1.101 oz. Coincidentally, it's labeled serving size is 30 g. Thus, a 1/4 cup amount is very close to its labeled serving, which is in grams of weight.

In order for your GI tract to efficiently extract its nutrients, I suggest that you run these seeds in a coffee grinder immediately before consumption.

The ground seeds have a strong flavor that I describe as ""very herbal"". They're definitely not a cuisinary seed, such as sesame ;-)

All banged up!;neutral
"I can be a little timid when it comes to trying sugar-free products. Many leave that horrible aftertaste or at the least take some serious getting used to. But I gave these a shot because I'm not willing to consume 4 cups of coffee a day with each having an extra 70 kcal shot of the regular syrup. That's an extra 280 calories at the start of my day! But these were positively delicious with no bad taste or guilt from empty calories.

So I gave the variety pack a go, knowing I was sure to find a quick favorite.

My favorite was the Vanilla. Sweet and earthy just like vanilla should be. I will definitely be buying this one again.

The Irish Cream was my second favorite out of the six. It adds an amazing creamy, buttery finish to each sip of coffee that you are sure to die for.

In third, was the Chocolate syrup. I am generally not a mocha fan so I used the chocolate syrup a bit sparingly at first. But soon I was splashing in even more. It has a very gentle dark chocolate flavor without the bitter notes usually associated with dark variety.

Next was the hazelnut. I am neither impressed nor detested by this flavor. It is a bit mediocre when compared to the more full-bodied syrups but will do in a pinch if you're craving that touch of sweetness.

Second to last we have the Classic Caramel. This was absolutely disappointing. I hoped for hints of cream and brown sugar, but instead got a simple sweet syrup with hardly any actual flavor. It did the job of sweetening my coffee but did not provide the caramel heaven I desired. I have heard the Salted Caramel is much better, so that flavor has been added to my ""To-Try List"".

Last is the raspberry, my least favorite. I am detested by the idea of fruity coffee (ei. blueberry, raspberry, etc.) so this was not a good coffee syrup for me. Instead, I decided to make raspberry tea with it. After several tries with black, green, and cranberry-pomegranate tea, I have decided this syrup just doesn't work well. As most of the syrups are made to add a subtle flavor to robust coffee, you have to add much more syrup if you want to actually flavor your tea. And all of that extra syrup just makes it way to sweet. This was also the only flavor I actually tasted that sugar-free aftertaste, though possibly because I had to use so much.

It's hard to give a good rating for a variety pack as there are three spectacular flavors and three slightly disappointing flavors.

Overall though I say this sampler is great if you're new to their syrups and would like to try a good variety of their flavors for a great price. But if you already have established your favorites, I'd suggest buying their 3 pack of a single flavor at the same retail-reduced price of under $5 a bottle.";neutral

Okay so for the price, this is to be expected, after all, it's organic. I was in a pinch for vanilla extract (REAL Vanilla Extract) and I bought here on Amazon.

It's a real high quality extract and using it in my baked goods and some other dishes, I could tell the difference in taste. I use a lot of vanilla extract so for me the only real downside is/was they don't make it bigger. Perhaps I will have to buy this in bulk.;neutral
These were kind of pricey and not what I expected. There is an orange color in the box that turns everything yellow and it doesn't go very far. It occurred to me that I could have used beet use for red, tumeric for orange and yellow, and spinach for green. These food colorings worked but they were expensive and didn't last very long. Next time I will save the money and do it myself.;neutral
Kind of dry.  I expected it to be moist, as Larabars usually are...maybe I just got a bad batch.  Anyway, it tastes ok with a cup of coffee.  Really nice that you can have something ALMOST like a brownie and know that its ingredients are good for you.;neutral

"These are fine - a little chemical but not too bad.  However, I bought them for calorie saving thinking ""sugar free"" meant zero or seriously reduced calories similar to dietCoke numbers. Not quite. Four pieces of the regular kind are 60 calories.  Four pieces of the sugar free kind are 40 calories.  OK, a 33% reduction but not what I was expecting.

Problem is, I ordered 6 packages of these cookies from Amazon and they are way more dried out than the ones I bought at the store locally. I suspect they have spent too much time in a warehouse.

I want to buy as many groceries as I can from Amazon, but this huge difference in quality between supermarket and Amazon makes it harder to do so.

I recommend heating them up in a microwave oven for 5-8 seconds to restore their moisture, right before you eat them.";neutral

They don't taste as good as other flavored K-cups but they're cheap. If you want a good flavor you have to pay a little more for it. They don't taste bad, they just rank towards the bottom of the ones i've tried.;neutral
The Tassimo brewer can make a cup of latte by using two T-Discs. One disc is the creamer and the other disc is the espresso. What you get is a reasonably good latte. There is no way you are going to compete with a coffee house that uses equipment that costs thousands of dollars and freshly ground coffee and fresh cream. But you will get a decent latte which is quickly prepared and saves you the time and money of a trip to the coffee house. I am personally a plain dark roast coffee sort of guy but my wife likes an occasional latte and she is perfectly satisfied with the Tassimo version. When she is out shopping she may stop at the coffee house for a high priced version but when she is at home the Tassimo satisfies her just fine. That is something I can't do but that is another story.;neutral
"If someone let you sample these blind-folded you would have trouble guessing the flavors, except the ""dragon's blood"", which tastes like cherry cough medicine. all the flavors are artificial, and, I think, nasty.

This is the exact reason why taste matters. We each can taste the same item and love it and hate it can be the review. If this is the BEST chocolate in the world YEAR AFTER YEAR and rates a 99 of 100 for example then the Lindt coco 70% with sea salt is a 95. The difference between lindt and this is so small that  you can barely taste the difference but will FEEL it in your wallet.;neutral

However, I have to say I like the others better, the coins are much too chewy for my taste and don't really dissolve very well; little bits often get stuck in my teeth instead. Think of chewing a stale tootsie roll. I'm not sure if mine are getting stale or if they're just made that way, I don't think I'll order more for a while. I'd love to have a variant of these with a little bit stronger licorice flavor and less tough chewiness. Maybe I'll try the cats next.";neutral
This jerky is made with fish sauce.  I am allergic to fish.  They really should put an allergy warning on the package and indicate fish on their sell page as well.  Who would've thought they'd use fish to make BBQ bacon jerky?  Fortunately I do not have a severe allergy and only had to deal with hives all over my body for 3 days. That being said, the jerky tasted okay.  Don't smell it.  Just eat it.  It smells way worse than it tastes.  The taste of fish lingers on the palate and breath long after the barbecue flavor dies.  The fish taste burps up well too.  So if you can't handle a fishy aftertaste, this is probably not the product for you.  Unfortunately, due to my fish allergy I had to toss the rest of this but at least I was able to taste it.;neutral
"I like Bumble Bee brand- I really do. They're affordable and taste good. I've always been a fan of their canned sea-food products and buy a lot of canned shrimp and clams from them. Canned shrimp in our store here in Alaska is about $4.00 a can. Way out of my budget. But there are so many yummy meals I can make with this shrimp, that I needed to find an alternative. Amazon (being the wonderful place that it is) had these cans at a much cheaper price with free shipping. I've purchased them four or five times now from Amazon.

The cans are always very full. The miniature shrimps are packed tightly with a bit of water. I typically give the water to my cats as a treat. The pure shrimp often upsets their stomach- but the shrimp-flavored water is a huge hit with them. The cans always come with an expiration date over a year away. The cans are never dented or incorrectly packaged. As for the shrimp, themselves, they're all uniformly sized (usually about as big as a nickel) in diameter. They're never over-salted. In fact they taste really mellow in flavor compared to other canned sea foods I've eaten. But I like them.

My main concern with this particular brand is that you never know where your shrimp are coming from. I've had cans where the shrimp was raised in Indonesia. Other times they've been from China. Sometimes Bumble Bee offers American-grown products, but I've never had shrimp labeld 'raised in the USA' through this brand. My main concern is that China has very lenient laws when it comes to shrimp farming. They're often fed human feces and are raised in areas where chemical pollution is evident in the water. Obviously I don't want to eat shrimp that have eaten other peoples waste. So I'm always sad when I receive a batch of cans from China. I honestly can't taste the difference- but the mentality of it makes me lose my appetite. I'd prefer I always receive the Indonesian shrimp (a place not as notorious for bad-quality as China).

Nevertheless, for the price, I can't complain. It's impossible to find other canned shrimp products for as affordable as Bumble Bee brand. So until my budget allows me to opt for shrimp grown in more reputable parts of the world, I'll continue to buy this brand. They are super yummy! I just wish them weren't from a place where quality food-production is not highly praised.";neutral
The taste is just right, earthy.  Lots of static when the beans are ground in my burr grinder. While I do live in high & dry Colorado many other coffee beans do not exhibit the same level of static. Just makes another mess to clean up;neutral
"It's great price for a huge container of coconut oil. Holy Moly, the coconut smell is strong. I used it to moisturize my feet one night and all I could think of was ""where's the pineapple?"" Even though it may smell great, the fact that the smells doesn't wear off for a very long time was unacceptable to me. I've eaten fresh coconut all my life, we cook with dry coconut. There is definitely added fragrance in this one.";neutral
Great quality organic coconut oil but it's packaging is designed for use in the kitchen not the bathroom. If you intend to use it as a moisturizer you'll have to put it in another container because you can't put your hand in this jar and reach in to scoop out anything but the first couple inches of coconut oil.;neutral
"While we like Kicking Horse Coffees, this particular variety wasn't as well liked.  It has a great aroma and the beans are nice and dark with a shiny/oily gleam.  The flavor is where it loses out.

"I suppose if I were still dieting obsessively and wanted a little flavor without calories to an extreme,  with a slight hint of the ""decadent"" ingredient,  chocolate (very slight) -- then this might hit the spot.

It is not a memorable taste to me, and I don't find it satisfying.  Might be different to someone else's taste.";neutral
I was looking for a smooth instant Organic coffee that was comparable to the Trader Joe's. I bought this one rather than Trader Joe's because I know that the Trader Joe's coffee is only $4 per container in the store, but over $10 on Amazon (quite a large mark-up, over DOUBLE, what a shame). Anyway, I found this to be a bitter coffee. I was unpleasantly surprised, due to the high general ranking of this coffee on Amazon.;neutral
I absolutely adore this spice. I use it in baked chicken parts and it just sends my entire household into watery mouth syndrome the entire time it's cooking. My favorite spice, flat out, ever. That being said, this particular brand leaves me a bit disappointed and I should have expected that, for the price. You get what you pay for. It hits the right notes, but it hits just a couple of those notes a bit too loudly for my tastes. When it cooks the scents of the others kind of drown the ones I don't like as much out, so it ends up being alright in the end, just a little disappointed. Probably would not order this particular brand again. Nice size bag for the money though.;neutral
"I don't think I'll reorder these since there are 3 rim-dented cans so far, (see other reviewers re this issue also) and the 2 that were not dented didn't taste the same as the ones from the grocery store. I don't know what happened to their gumbo but I won't be getting any more.

I took all of the gumbo cans completely out of the plastic overwrap to better examine them and found that 9, not 3, out of the 12 were dented on the top rim, near the rip top loop. They appeared to have been mashed or grabbed by a tool during their manufacture that left the same dent pattern on all of the cans.
I contacted Amazon customer service via chat and they promptly refunded my money.

"I don't know what to think of this. I bought these on a regular basis a couple of years ago and they were great -- fresh, crisp, peanut-buttery. I couldn't get enough of them. However, when I bought them this time around, they were a little on the stale tasting side. The crackers were a little soft and old-tasting, the peanut buttery a little crumbly instead of smooth. Did I just get a ""lemon"" in this package? I don't know, but since they come in 40 packs and I don't like eating them due to their slightly horrid taste, I won't be buying another batch to find out. Also, it's kind of a waste to throw these out since it's still food, so I'm eating them at a rate of a pack every two weeks, which definitely contributes to their stale taste... ugh. My husband asked me to check the expiration date and get a refund, but I stupidly had already thrown the box out.";neutral
"First impression was wow - these are great!

Orange is my favorite flavor, the others are hard to describe, I don't think they really tasted spot on to what they were supposed to be, it's not that they were bad, I just didn't think that ""Strawberry"" tasted like strawberries etc.  I didn't like the Rasberry's as much as the other flavors, but they were still ok.

The bad part is that I don't remember off hand how much they were, but these suckers are not exactly devoid of calories - they actually have quite a lot.  Maybe it's a lot less than a suger candy would have, but if they can make a diet soda with 0 calories, why can't they make a candy with 0 calories?

And the warning is be careful, they are addictive and if you have too many, whatever they are using to make it taste good (sugar alcohol?) may wreak havoc with your plumbing, if you get my drift...  Took me a while to figure out what it was, but I'm pretty sure it was these guys.";neutral

I was introduced to Marley coffee via an after Christmas clearance on K-cups at the local Office Depot. I tried finding it again and found it almost impossible until checking Amazon. All stores around me have discontinued carrying it.  This roast, Mystic Morning, is a bit too 'earthy' tasting for me.  It's a very dark roast for medium but I'm discovering that the case with quite a few brands nowadays. I will say it was not bitter at all.  Smooth all the way. And that the company gives back to a charity is admirable. Get Up Stand Up is my favorite, so far, from Marley. If you like a very smooth, mild, lighter coffee, try the Get Up Stand Up. You won't be disappointed.  If you prefer darker, try the One Love.  Can't say I'm a fan of Mystic Morning, however. Considering how dark their mediums are, I won't even bother trying their dark/espresso roasts.;neutral
"What a mess. One of these sealed and never used containers turned on its side in the pantry. Sesame oil EVERYWHERE! The jar lid was lose. Checked the other jar and under the seal, it EASILY turned a 1/4 to a 1/2 turn indicating how lose the lid was. Lid machine not sealing lids on jars properly.
Taste: Very mild and without bitterness. Not many solids. Would be great to replace part of the cooking oil in making sweet items where sweet items would benefit from this taste. There are recipes on the net for making cookies etc. using sesame oil or tahini.
Next time I order, I plan to check jars under their lids and know that I may have to pour the contents into another container which I can screw the lid down properly. Check the outside of the jars and if there are any oil deposits, just open and transfer at that moment. Cleaning up a quart of sesame oil/tahini from your pantry shelf is the worst kind of choir.

This was so disappointing. Nothing special, very small kernels of corn. I was so excited to order because popcorn is my favorite snack and somebody told me this was the best you can buy.

I didn't look closely enough at the description of the rice packaging.  I thought from the photo it would be in a pouch... but instead it's in a bowl with a cardboard sleeve around the bowl.

So even though we enjoyed the rice, and found it convenient, I won't be purchasing it again.;neutral
Not bad for Chiclets type of gum. But i prefer the texture of trident or orbit, where you can chew it for a while. I've talked to several people that say the same thing. Pur just makes you want to spit it out after a few chews and try another one. Not long lasting.;neutral

At first I wasn't thrilled about it but this has grown on me. I love the green tea flavor, or I suppose I should say I love the idea of that flavor but every time I have a piece Im thinking that it could be so much better. I can't really put my finger on how though. The level of sweetness is good, leaning towards high. Two pieces at a time for me after meals is how I have been chewing it and the thing I was looking for most it mostly accomplishes - that is I wanted something that didn't create a dominating flavor in my mouth but was light and somewhat clean tasting. That's all pretty darn subjective, and I will not be getting this again but it's one more step on my journey to find the perfect gum and it was ok.;neutral
After having read reviews for every pure vanilla, I decided to order this one. I have to say I'm really not impressed.

"This New! Ice Chips Candy Variety Pack 2 Featuring Root Beer Float! A variety pack of 6 tins including the following flavors: Juicy Berry Mix, Real Peppermint, Real Lemon, Cinnamon, Licorice and Root Beer Float is delicious, perhaps comparable to true ambrosia -  flavors fit for the gods.  Each little chip of candy - in all the flavors - gives a chill nip to the tongue.  Not overpowering, just pleasant.  The flavors are - flavorful - and match each tin's lable.  All but the cinnamon and root beer chips are white and if mixed together are indistinguishable until tasted.

All that said, there are some reports that indicate sweetener used in this candy,  Xylitol, raises glucose levels in the blood, so diabetics might want to avoid this candy despite the manufacturer's claims.  Additionally, Xylitol is a hydrogenated product which may lead to other medical problems such as obesity, cancer, diabetes, and other problems.  Although not toxic to humans, Xylitol has been shown to be highly toxic to pets, especially dogs.  Just so no one thinks I'm making this stuff up, I have links to articles written by respected researchers and will gladly provide them if asked.  Not allowed to put links in here that are not to other Amazon products, though.

I think what it boils down to is ""everything in moderation"".  Although I, personally, do not like the way this candy is marketed as ""healty""  I do believe the flavors of this candy are stupendous, but the possible health risks don't quite balance the scales.";neutral
I've ordered a 4 pack of these nuts and have enjoyed them but I don't believe the claim on the label that there's less than 50% peanuts in the mix.  I think it's about 75% peanuts.

First off, this powder does taste nice. It has a faint smokiness and doesn't taste as bitter as some cheap store brand cayenne powders, it tastes fresh. Of course, I was looking for something with far more heat... so... yeah. This powder really is not that hot. I regularly eat ghost pepper sauces and other very hot pepper products, so my tolerance may be higher than the average consumer, but honestly guys this in no way extremely hot. I found I was able to put a generous dusting of it all over my food, and while it gives a nice building warmth in the mouth that will get hot if you dump a whole bunch on, don't think that a tiny pinch is going to set you over the edge. So, while I do very much like the taste and warm heat it brings, I believe it is much over hyped for how hot it is.;neutral

Not the same quality as I used to buy in a 200 gr glass jar in some local grocery stores years ago. Also, it seems to have a bit of an energizing effect or might be some heavy for digestion at late evening/night time. Better to be used first half of the day for someone who's looking for a coffee substitute. Seems to be of a lower grade Inca in these paper cans comparing to the old familiar in the glass one. I haven't tried yet the one in the glass jar this seller offers here. But, the seller offers 100 gr glass jar for around 7 dollars including shipping. About 5 years ago, I used to buy 200 gr glass jar of Inka (as mentioned above) for around the same price.;neutral

The Beef Jerky tastes good and seems fresh although I couldn't be sure of the freshness because I ordered 8 boxes, (12 sticks per box), and they were all removed from the original retail boxes, (which would have  the expiration date on them), and placed into one large box.

Not crazy about the coloring in the bunny snacks. It mentions on the label just the word color.

"ok, here's the deal.
this is like organic peanut butter in consistency -- you have to stir THOROUGHLY. Unlike PB, you have to heat this stuff up first. I used boiling hot water, per directions. The microwave would be faster, but didn't want to risk the blob exploding. It is a glass jar, which is microwave-friendly, and it had no visible foil parts in the lid, so it looks safely microwaveable.  It took me 15 minutes of replenishing hot water, and judicious and patient stirring to get it consistent. It's very oily, so it's messy, because the jar is not as deep as PB jars, so you have to go slower to avoid spillage. Luckily, coconut oil is light and relatively easy to clean. Once you stir, then put in the fridge to hold the consistency. If you keep it at room temp, it will separate again, and you'll have pure oil, and pure paste.

The flavor is unlike any coconut product i've had. It's got no added sugar, which is good, but that means its sweetness is VERY subtle. The paste itself has a slightly bitter flavor up front, and a mellow coconut aftertaste. I love virtually all forms of coconut, but you have to be a hardcore coconut junkie to eat this stuff by the spoon. It's a little too oily for that, in my opinion.

Since the price is right, a little under 9 bux for two jars, I figured it was worth a gamble. For now, it has no obvious uses. I'll experiment. As for smoothies, I'm sure it will blend better than pure coconut oil (added for the MCT energy), but I suspect it will still harden in the icy smoothie. Not harden like coconut oil does -- in rice-sized waxy kernels -- but probably something a little more coconutty.

Recommend improvements for the manufacturer -- market in taller jars, since this has to be vigorously mixed, to minimize oily spillage.";neutral

There was a lot of potato based snacks, some butter cookies, some gum, and marshmallows which we already have a ton of in the states.

"I use the all purpose mix and add my own seasonings. I also use the Pizza mix which is OK. This mix however, is my least favorite so far (except for the cinnamon rolls...what did I do wrong?). I think of Focaccia as a bread I could make a sandwich out of. Not this Focaccia, sorry to say.

I've gone gluten free and Chebe has filled some of the voids of not having bread. But, nothing is going to fulfill it completely. Stick with the all purpose and season as desired for most anything you wish to make. They all call for the same ingredients: 2 eggs, a cup of shredded cheddar cheese (which is not healthy in my opinion but is needed to make these mixes work), oil and milk or water. I prefer adding my own seasonings to what has been added to the mixes depending on what I want. Onion powder and garlic salt make for good bread sticks, oregano and basil for pizza dough, dill and sea salt for somewhat tasty bread for toasting.....whatever is left over, FREEZE IT!. None of it keeps well for later consumption. It takes on a baking soda taste with the texture of sawdust (like all gluten free breads tend to do) if you don't freeze it. However, this mix does turn out the chewiest of gluten free breads I've tried so far so I recommend you try it and work on coming up with ideas how to make it work for your needs.

I also recommend you sharing recipes if you master any using this mix.....I want a tuna salad sandwich so bad I dream about it. :)";neutral

I am a chocolat lover, and ordered as many chocolate flavored K-cups as I could find. My daughter and I did blind taste testing to find the ones we like the best. My daughter loved this coffee. I liked it too, but it is such a light roast that it seems watery at even just 8 ounces. It is best at 6 ounces.

"I drink green tea daily, lots of it. But caffeine gives me the jitters and headaches. So I usually decaffeinate my own green tea. But since that takes time, I decided to try some organic decaf tea right from the bag.
To my unpleasant surprise, this stuff is really basic. Minimal flavor, Very generic. Like something from the dollar store.
I'm trying to finish the bag so I can purchase something better!";neutral
While this product is pretty good with chocolate pieces included, the amount of mix seems less than competitors, leading to thin brownies. IF one puts an extra egg in the recipe, it comes out too cake like. I'm returning to the standards of Duncan Hines or Betty Crocker,  adding in some chocolate chips,  which surprisingly to my tastes provides a more satisfying brownie than this more fancy brand. Also, the test for the brownies being ready isn't as straightforward as they can only be cooked by time, leaving less room for error. Better products are available.;neutral
"Hmm...now that I have this, I'm not sure what ""real sugar"" means.  Is it cane sugar?  And if so, why doesn't it way so?  It tastes fine, but not like the Pepsi Throwback that used to be available and made with cane sugar.  That was way better.  Still, this tastes better than corn syrup Pepsi.";neutral
"I have always loved black turtle beans and eat them often. I was happy to learn of Eden Organic and the no-BPA can. As others reported, the shipment arrived very badly dented. Wasn't thrilled with that, but okay. Stuff happens. The real disappointment came when I opened the first can. I actually thought I had opened a can of kidney beans by mistake.

These are not traditional black turtle beans. I don't know what kind of bean they are, but if you are looking for the traditional black turtle bean, this is not it. And it's not just the reddish brown color that gives these away - even the taste is unlike traditional black beans.

They don't taste bad, just more along the lines of a kidney bean taste instead of a black bean. I know there are other types of black beans and maybe this is one of those. But the can says black turtle beans and those they certainly are not.";neutral
I was a bit disappointed when I got this. I was expecting more quality over normal instant oats. Taste is not that different from any other brand.  Texture wise is also nit diferent. Maybe it was because I received one that was expired on January 2018 and I got it new on April.  Will not buy again.;neutral
I bought this to drink in place of coffee because I was concerned that coffee was causing health problems but was suffering from caffeine-withdrawal headaches. Luckily the coffee wasn't the root of my problems so I'm back to drinking every morning because this tea is not very tasty and doesn't give me the pick-me-up I was hoping it would. It just tastes to me like plain black tea and I really prefer to taste something in my tea- cinnamon, mint, orange, spice, SOMETHING! It might be ok with lemon or a dash of sugar and cinnamon...I've got 6 boxes so I'll try some variations and report back.;neutral
Weak flavor and I would prefer it without the rum. I loved the banana cream flavor and wish this was just Raspberry cream with stronger raspberry flavor. Coffee arrived in excellent condition and the seller is very nice.;neutral
"Mine was boxed, as in the item photo on Amazon, and not tossed in a mailing envelope like the guy in the reviews.

Since the flavor lasts 90 seconds, and after that it's akin to chewing dried pine sap, you can imagine that I don't buy Fruit Stripe gum for the gum.  You would be correct.  I buy Fruit Stripe gum for the tattoos on the inner wrapper.  Lick the back of your hand, or your friend's cheek, and slap this sucker on there.  When you peel it back--or when your friend rips it off his face and starts chasing you around the room--there will be an inky blue temporary tattoo that will look like a bruise that resembles a zebra.  A drunk zebra.  Parading across your pal's kisser.  That's why we buy this gum, let's call it what it is.";neutral
"I love this salt! I don't just use it for finishing, I use it for cooking. It has a great mild flavor and is easy to grab pinches of when cooking. I cook daily for 2, sometimes twice a day, and this tub will probably last me a few months, maybe half a year.

I found it sort of strange that it doesn't have an air proof seal - the top arrives secured by a breakaway tab, but the cap fits loosely so air definitely gets in. If you use this slowly over time, make sure to stash Arm & Hammer wherever you stow this.

Hope my review helps and happy shopping!";positive

"I chose this to cut out some of the sugar on my morning drinks. I mix this with espresso and milk to create a white mocha that tastes very similar to Starbucks, which is what i was going for. The syrup is a nice consistency and not lumpy at all. It blends well with warm or hot drinks though I have not tried it on cold drinks. It is a rather large container so I store the large one and refil a small squeeze bottle as needed. This product does not have that ""fake sugar"" taste at all.";positive

Ive been drinking this for several years now and my only complaint is that it is difficult to come by and can be ridiculously expensive.  One thing though.....if you are looking for sweet and/or a strong fruit taste, this water is not for you.  This water is infused water with just a HINT (very very subtle) of flavor.;positive
Funny, I am drinking this tea as I type, it has a little Jiaogulan tea with it, and honey. Remember rinse once, then steep. This tea is the best coffee I have ever drank. And I wrote coffee as an intention, as a signal to flavor and feeling. You can do anything to Puh 'er and it will still dominate. What makes it ever better is one of my three favorite tea growers, wholesellers is Gortea. They are one of those tea companies where if you have a problem they will help you. If just hate the purple glory pouring ito the cup of this tea, then do not stay with Puh'er. Drink something commoner like an orange pekoe or mint tea.;positive
LOVE these crackers. They are so tasty you can eat them plan and before you know it you consumed the whole package. We bought another box after trying them the first time.  I wish they could have these available all the time.;positive
Good product, would order again;positive
BEST BEST MAC AND CHEESE;positive
"I usually order teas directly from Golden Tips.  The teas are fresh, top quality and shipping is fast.  At Christmas I received Amazon gift cards so placed my tea order through Amazon.  I love fresh cardamon and enjoy enjoy baking and cooking with it.  There is nothing better than adding some orange zest and fresh cardamon to a chocolate recipe.
If you love cardamon as much as I do then this chai is for you.

There is a good black tea base and just the right amount of cardamon to please.  It's great plain or with a bit of honey or jaggery and even a splash of milk.  This also excellent as a milk chai.  I've tried numerous recipes from this site
http://www.chai-tea.org/recipes.html
and prefer using 1/2 and 1/2 or 1/2 and 1/2 with almond milk adding no water.  It's even better if you let the chai slow simmer for a while. Knocks my socks!

This chai will remain a favorite in our favorite in our house.";positive
Since most corn is now genetically altered to emit pesticide as it grows I love that I am able to still eat hard shell tacos without all the dangerous ingredients. These shells do break easily but I'm sure that's do to them being all real, all natural without added chemicals to keep them hard. We find that there are enough whole shells to enjoy a taco and we use the broken ones for salads or nachos. This 12 pack ensures that there is enough for large dinner parties. Since they don't expire for many months we usually have plenty for several taco meals and make sure we eat them up before expiration.;positive
Growing up in England I know great toffee when I eat it. My daughter sent me Walkers Original Toffee for Christmas and I've ordered about one a week since then. It's not helping my diet, but it sure satisfies my sweet tooth! Now my fiance is hooked, too! If you love great toffee, this is for you.;positive
I tried these True Lemon products on the advise of my daughter.  These are GREAT for spicing  up bland foods.  I am on a sodium restricted diet and food was....not tasting too good without salt.  These True Lemon, Orange, and Lime packets come in handy when I go out to eat.  I will be buying more, in shakers for home use.  By the way, these really taste like the real thing.;positive
One of my favorite brands.;positive
Before I say anything, I should let you know that this is the very first pre-mixed gluten free flour I've tried. With that said, this mix makes absolutely delicious pancakes that are best enjoyed with real, pure maple syrup. In fact, I quite prefer the pancakes from this mix to those containing gluten. My only complaint is that when I bake with them, the sweet flavor of the mix can be a bit overpowering. If you adjust the amount of sugar added, this becomes less of an issue. Overall, this is an excellent mix!;positive
Honestly, I purchase Green Valley Organic green beans for my grandchildren.  I want them to eat more organic foods.  So, rather than hassle my daughter about buying organic, I purchase these along with the Green Valley organic whole kernel supersweet corn and send them directly to their house.  Best news:  my grandchildren love these beans and they don't know they're eating healthy.  I also think they taste great, which is why I purchased them in the first place.;positive
This worked absolutely great making churros.  If people are having issues with the lid falling off, they aren't screwing it on tight enough.  I wish there was a size between the 2 biggest ones this set comes with.  That size would be more in line with what you usually see at carnivals/amusement parks etc.  Be careful when you cut off the dough into the oil.  If you are too high, it will splash oil on your hands.;positive
A friend of mine sent me an email recommending this tea. Just for the heck of it, I ordered a canister. It is nicely aromatic and has a very festive flavor, reminiscent of the holidays. One of my guests loved it so much that I decided to give her mine and order another.;positive

I love this stuff. I use it in my coffee frequently. This is my favorite sugar alternative I have found to date, although, the ingredients still has sugar in it, I don't feel so bad because I don't need nearly as much. I also have found Stevia works decent in my coffee. I like this better than the original splenda and feel it is a little healthier??? I would be interested in a sweetener that is 100% pure monk fruit, if that is possible. I haven't seen that anywhere out there yet.;positive
As sold and stated, reliable.;positive
a very fine chocolate which is smooth, just bitter enough, and great for just eating and baking. i just rec'd this in the mail and i could not be more pleased.  i am a caterer and  i use this chocolate a lot.  i find the chocolate from Amazon is much fresher than buying it a store.  there is a big difference in texture and quality when the chocolate is fresh.  outstanding.  highly recommend.;positive

"I'm a big Marmite fan, so I had to try the Australian Vegemite as well.
I think I like it better. It's a little milder, so more useable without mixing it with butter, etc. (Marmite I mixed 50-50 with butter).
I would recommend it to anyone who wants a strong umami spread on bread, crackers, bagels, etc.";positive

Finally I have found some real coconut milk! I have been looking for a long time. The Silk stuff you buy at the grocery store is like water and seems like a total waste of money! This is so creamy and tasty it's unbelievable! I LOVE it in my fruit smoothies w/ a touch of maple syrup. It tastes almost like my favorite NOOSA yogurt and it's hard to believe that it's actually healthy and not loaded w/ bad calories!!!;positive
I use this flour in an unconventional way. Years ago a dermatologist recommended the Dermalogica line of skin care products and I especially liked their daily exfoliant, which is rice based and supposedly very gently.  The product line isn't inexpensive but seemed worth the cost.  I like to experiment with DIY formulas as well and so tried to duplicate a rice based exfoliant using a mortar and pestle as well as grinding rice in a Vitamin blender and met with good results.  but I read an online blog suggesting using rice flour to the same effect. It was important that the flour be organic since rice is notoriously grown with pesticides you certainly don't want on your skin.  Long story short, I found this product to be almost identical to the Dermalogica in fineness, gentleness and effectiveness but at a fraction of the cost!  Needless to say, this has become my exfoliant of choice.  Just fut a small amount in the palm or your hand or a small glass container and add a few drops of water, preferably filtered or distilled until it forms a thick paste. Massage it gently all over your face and leave on a few minutes if you wish to get the full benefits and nutrients of the rice as well. As a frame of reference, Dermalogica Daily Exfoliant is $46 for 2.6 oz. or $17.67/oz.  The Rice Flour is $11.42 or 48 cents per ounce, which makes the former about 37 times more expensive!  Highly recommended!;positive
"For the price, this is a must buy if you like dark chocolate that is not too sweet. If you were to buy these bars in the East Coast you could expect to pay $1.75 per bar if you buy them one bar at a time. I paid roughly .90 cents per bar. definitely worth the price.

As for the quality and freshness, I thought both were excellent. I have bought them from stores in the mid-atlantic area and found the bars to be less than fresh, so I was delighted to taste the bars the way they are supposed to taste.

My recommendation is if your only reservation to buying this particular product is its quality, buy it. You won't be dissatisfied based on my experience. Your pallat will thank you then you will thank me later :)";positive

I am a fan, husband not so much. They have no added sugar which is important for diabetic and gastric bypass patients. They have a good flavor, not too sweet, slightly crunchy and about the size of a mini candy bar.;positive
These are the most DIVINE candies EVER!!!!  Can't stop eating them.  I can't open them fast enough.  If you like peanut butter, and if you like ginger, you can't go wrong with these.  They have just the right balance of earthiness and substance from the peanut butter, and just the right amount of sparkle from the ginger.  A WINNER!!!;positive

"Mr. Yoshida's Original Gourmet Sweet and Savory sauce is pure ambrosia! My whole family loves this stuff. We eat it on all the meats and have it 1 - 2 times a week; usually with those King Soba Sweet Potato and Buckwheat noodles. Absolutely delicious!";positive
Great product. Little goes a long way. I brew 1 tsp to 1 cup of boiling water. Rebrew the same leaves right away with another cup of boiling water, cool the whole thing and blend it with crushed ice, some berry juice, lemon and a slice of ginger for a refreshing antioxidant drink.;positive
"I first had Ro-tel tomatoes in the famous ""queso"" dip (1 lb of velveeta cheese, cubed; 1 can of Ro-tel, dump everything into a 2-qt bowl, and microwave until melted, stirring occasionally).  It's the perfect spicy foil to the creamy cheese, and everyone seems to love it.

I use it often, too, in my chili -- especially good with beef (I use chuck, cubed into 1/2"" cubes), black beans, onion, and a mixture of spices and herbs; in stews and other soups, even in pasta sauce!  I love the spicy kick it gives.  Not everyone will like the heat -- I consider it mild/medium; others find it ""too hot.""

Ordering through Amazon Pantry results in a price that is comparable to my local supermarket prices.  Super convenient, too.

Definitely will order this again.";positive
I use coconut oil to help with my neuropathy. I have used it for years. This was my first purchase of the Nutiva brand coconut oil and it was clearly a high quality oil at a very good price. Would recommend it.;positive
these are a family favorite.  so glad the assortment is back and hope it is not for a limited time. they don't have near the different cookies i remember, but we'll be happy with what they are willing to make and sell.  they are a good little cookie for those not affected by gluten.;positive
Overall this is an ok product.  Will it knock your socks off?  No.  Especially if you are familiar with what Kona coffee actually is and are accustomed to the taste. The price is really high for a 10% blend, but if you are craving that Kona flavor, this will give you a little bit of that.  I will look elsewhere for some higher quality next time.;positive
"During a Halloween party last month, a man was standing against a wall with a bag of these in his hands. I did a double-take. I straightened. Then I approached him slowly, my eyes wide, my steps cautious. Could it really be? Are these the same candies I have literally been searching for in vain for the last fifteen years?

Poor guy. He must have been pretty shocked when I took the bag right out of his hand, opened it wide at the top, and gazed down at its contents. Precious, precious contents. Like little barely-wrapped pieces of gold, they appeared to me. This was indeed them.
The next thing I did was look at the damn brand name on the bag. I've been looking for these candies for so long and failing, and all I really needed to know all that time was what the heck the brand name was: Albert's. I memorized it instantly.

And then I gushed, handing back the bag. ""I'm sorry! I've just been looking for these candies that I used to eat all the time when I was a kid. I loved them so much! The way they were nice and hard, like tangy taffies but without the tang, the way they could be smoothed into a kind of delicious wafer that would slowly melt in the mouth, the TASTE!"" The very gracious man smiled, took my hands, and dumped half the bag into them. I thanked him profusely, ate every single one of them, and then went home and ordered four bags of this stuff from Amazon.

In case you haven't gathered thus far - I love these candies. Thank goodness they haven't changed one iota over the last thirty years. The grape is my favorite, followed by the strawberry. Nothing else in the world is quite like them. Their consistency, their flavor, their size - they are all perfect.
Luck was with me that Halloween. :)";positive
"I was in the market for a meal replacement as my regular Amazon replacement
subscription product became unavailable.  I bought this product for a
couple of reasons, one I really liked that it was fermented as I try to,
but fail to incorporate enough cultured foods into my diet, and I also
liked that it has mushrooms in it. feeling like mushrooms have a lot of health benefit.
 When I tried it I was very happy that
it does not taste too sweet or too vanillia or fake flavor like some of
these mixes taste to me.  I also was very pleased that when I am in a hurry
it really is easy to just stir up into water not leaving lumps or big ole
dry places of product that I have to try to stir up usually while driving
to work.";positive
We live abroad and have a hard time finding cheese, and have tried many cheese powders,  and love this one.  Just bought 3 boxes. Easy mac n cheese, just line kraft, great on popcorn, or broccoli.  And great price,  considering it is dry and goes a long way.;positive
This is the best stuff ever to put on popcorn! I ordered a bunch of these a couple of Christmases ago as stocking stuffers for my kids! They loved it! And my daughter from England has me order some when they're coming to visit, so that she can take them back with her. She has several friends and family members back home who ask her to bring some back! Love it!!!;positive
I like best popcorn that's hulless and small.  It seems the smaller popped kernels are for flavorful and more refined.  Using organic extra-virgin coconut oil adds wonderful flavor.  Hard to put down the bowl.;positive
"About a year ago we became aware of the good properties of coconut oil, and began using it both as an ingredient (replacing other oils and butter) in dishes and to pan-cook foods in. Try cooking a mushroom & jack omelet in a little coconut oil -- it is really outstanding.

We have other coconut oil products that we like, especially one that is a coconut & untoasted sesame seed oil blend, but are always looking for other great products. Of all people, my mother (a southern cook to the core...) called a few weeks ago suggesting that we give this Nature's Way EfaGold Coconut Oil a try, noting that she had a dish cooked with it while visiting friends, and really liked it.

Glad that she called. It is tasty, it has a decent smoke point so we can use it as an ingredient and also use it to cook with, and (contrary to thinking of just a few years ago) its fatty acids seem to be darned good for you.

We have yet to get to the level of use that others mention, like putting it in smoothies or eating a raw teaspoon each day, but who knows... maybe we will. Right now we are cooking with it and totally recommend it for use in that way.

Looking for a good, healthier oil alternative? Give this coconut oil a try.";positive

"One of my favorite things I tried in the last couple of years. I was looking for a cold dessert that tastes great, with good texture and lower calories. I tried everything to have a break from only having fruits as a healthier choice. But only 90 calories is a hard thing to beat if you stop to think this is ice-cream, usually the same serving size for other ice cream is around 140 - 180 cal.

The blueberry flavor is great too if you liked this one. The peach not so much as it has a strange texture and aftertaste.";positive

"I eat  raw, in-shell walnuts for medicinal purposes and they have had a dramatic impact on improving my eye health. Processed shelled raw walnuts do not provide the same health benefits and are only suitable for baking.  It's difficult to find raw, in-shell walnuts in stores year round, because most grocers consider this product to be a seasonal item and only make it available during year end holidays.

I have tried several brands and really like this one because there are very few inedible nuts in the bag and less waste. These nuts were a pleasant and tasty surprise, after having had several bad batches of raw walnuts from another supplier. A lot of suppliers cater to birds and not people but not this supplier. I will continue to order these monthly and hope that the quality remains excellent.";positive
"I find most decaf coffees to be bland. The processing takes away too much flavor. This is the exception. It is truly strong and bold. Highly recommended.

If you like strong flavored coffee, try Jamacia-me-crazy, also here on Amazon. It has caffeine, so I generally mix two of these and one of them (in a large thermos).";positive
"I am very interested in nutrition. Recently became aware ""table salt"" really is unhealthy. Unprocessed salt, such as Himalyan, contains other health promoting micronutrients. Have substituted this for ""salt"" in a few recipes. Can not taste any difference. Will use it exclusively in the future.";positive
I can't speak on it being healthy but doing the job for eggs, it is excellent. We use to use flax seed to try to hold together our pancakes or baking a vegan cake but it was 75% there. The egg replacer gets it 98% there;positive
Living in Afghanistan and the threat of MREs looming, I'm trying to discover foods with long shelf life stability that I can prepare an easy, tasty dish using a microwave, crockpot or rice cooker or other quick means.  This was a good buy. Personally I love chorizo, both the Spanish and Mexican kinds. Of course its not good to have the Mexican kind as it it more fresh. I'm dependent on the US Mail to send me my packages, so perishables are not a  good investment unless its during winter.  Never the less, this was a tasty sausage that I will be sure to buy more of for stock.;positive
My mother always has Bisto in the cupboard to help thicken drippings from pot roasts. I was glad to locate it through Amazon so that I could give a boost to my crockpot beef stews and have it on hand for browning in other beef dishes. It makes a nice, tasty gravy over potatoes, hot sandwiches, etc.  It's a British product so it's not readily available in local supermarkets.;positive

Good selection;positive
"Consider this a potential winner for any occasion that calls for a gift that's out of the ordinary yet affordable and likely to be appreciated by the recipient.

Half of the appeal is the packaging.  The items could be contained in half the space, but the bamboo box and bamboo ""latches"" are a conversation piece in themselves.

As for the flowering teas, the ""blossoming"" of the tea bud and the serving of the tea (which doesn't taste like Lipton's but is quite pleasant and pleasurable, with a hint of sweetness) make for a serenely appealing aesthetic.  I thought that perhaps I alone was ignorant about flowering teas, but to my satisfaction my guests were no less surprised and captivated than I by the whole experience.

Besides Numi, a company by the name of Primulo is apparently worth checking out as well (if Amazon reviews are to be trusted).  As for this Numi set, one ""bud"" nicely serves 2-3 people (small tea cups recommended).  It may not be ""historically accurate,"" but I can't think of a better product for illustrating, or introducing young people to, the ""Japanese tea ceremony"" and its central place in a ""stress-insulated Zen-like tradition.""";positive
loved the flavors. nice sample pack. I think samplers should hold 2 k-cups of each flavor and more different flavors. I hate buying a box of something I find out I don't like. Start selling just 1 k-cups and let people buy as many flavors as they want, or let the customer make their own sample pack.;positive
The best black licorice I have had! This has a strong black licorice flavor, with just a hint of molasses in the back taste. And a nice mouth feel as you eat it. The pieces are really big, and meaty, really gives you something to bite into. I ordered four bags, working on eating my second bag, and just ordered four more bags.;positive
Lovely flavor!!!;positive
I love these blends. They are very heavy on the citrus, and thus pretty sour. I like sour. The orange ginger is good enough to mix with water (and a little sweetener) and drink! The lime, garlic and cilantro is not as citrus-ey as the other two (or perhaps the garlic cancels out some of the lime taste). It's very good on seafood. The Lemon pepper is good on just about everything. You will need a lot less salt on your food if you use these blends and they are sugar free and salt free - so you gets points for being healthy.;positive
The day I received these Passion Fruit, I had also ordered Cherry - my favorite. I tried the cherry first, and, it had a lovely flavor. Then, I tried one of the Passion Fruit, and, I did not like it at all. A few weeks later, when the cherry sticks were gone, I tried these again, and, I loved the flavor. It has a very nice fruity flavor, a little richer than fruit punch would be. I learned not to mix the flavors, because I am certain that is why I was I was not happy with the taste. I plan to get more, in addition to the cherry, of course.;positive
"If you've eaten dried fruit before, you know instinctively that drying brings out the fruit's natural sugars, so that it tastes sweeter. It makes sense, then, that dried bananas, a.k.a. banana chips, should be fresh and sweet -- just like these.

Don't be fooled by the other brands sold in bulk here on Amazon; banana chips are not supposed to taste like cardboard soaked in rancid oil. Get these. You won't be disappointed.

Now, if only they sold them in bulk .... ;)";positive
"We eat a LOT of peanut butter in our large family, so I'm always looking for a good balance between price, wholesome ingredients and bulk containers.  I decided to try this Skippy Natural peanut butter, and I'm very happy with it.

It has no preservatives, artificial flavors or colors, and it didn't taste ""different"" to us the way it did to several other reviewers.  I did notice that there was a little oil on the top, but a quick stir and it was ready to eat.  That's a small price to pay for not having preservatives in it.

I eat a low carb diet, and peanut butter is a high-protein, low carb snack when I eat it on a spoon.  I fix school lunches with PB&J sandwiches, and I also cook Asian dishes using peanut butter.

As of right now, the price ($6.56) is equal to buying jars of store brand peanut butter, so I'm stocking up.  I'm happy to see the price dropping again after several years of peanut butter being so expensive.";positive
Often traveling with my husband over the years, whenever we would stop to gas up the car, I would go into the mini mart an my quest to find Sugar Daddys.  I am finding that it is harder and harder to locate any.  So I did the next best thing and ordered these.  They are perfect.  Just like the ones I had as a kid.  They taste fresh, are nice and hard, not soft, so that they last time.  The flavor is perfect.  I am going to savor the taste of each one.;positive
It is WAY too sweet and I would ask the company to not put sugar in their product. If I want sugar I will add it myself which I would not because The whole point of trying to eat healthy is to NOT EAT SUGAR! I put this in my smoothies for the peanut butter flavor and the protein with less fat.;positive
I love this pepper. It is quite strong but thats how I like my pepper. I have always bought the ground black pepper from simply organic so I decided to try this, it definitely adds some depth to the recipes I use it in. If you like a strong pepper flavor I would recommend you give this cracked pepper a try. I absolutely love it.;positive
"Hello. I love salt and vinegar chips. I mean, I LOVE salt and vinegar chips. But most people must be lightweights when it comes to tolerating a sour taste, because I have yet to find a salt and vinegar potato chip brand with the amount of mouth-blistering, eye-watering, stomach-aching, hyphen-using madness I require.

Enter this robust flavoring powder. Now I can destroy myself from the inside out with an acid blast of epic proportions. This stuff is GOOD. I haven't tried other brands, but I love salt and I love vinegar and this product has both. So there. And since you asked, this is what I do with it...

I use Kettle Brand Sea Salt & Vinegar chips as a base. Then I pour an inhuman amount of this seasoning into the bag and shake it up like a hyperactive monkey. And then I do that again. And again. I told you - inhuman.

Then I sit back in my throne room and enjoy bestowing a sour punishment upon myself the likes of which people in small towns speak of to passing tourists. So good. So, so good. But be warned, after eating a large quantity of this stuff the entire inside of your mouth, tongue included, will whiten and shed like a glorious snake, revealing a supple and (thankfully) temporarily sensitive surface behind. Sound like fun?

This is now my new favorite K-cup flavor!  Anytime I see chocolate raspberry truffle flavored coffee beans I buy some since it is sometimes hard to find.  I was sooo excited to see a k-cup with this flavor.  It did not disappoint!  You can definitely smell it when it brews too.  I do add sweetener, which may not be everyone's taste, but to me it makes the coffee taste like I'm eating a real raspberry flavored chocolate truffle.  It is now my favorite afternoon treat/pick me up.;positive
Great for the price.  This is one of our top four energy drinks we will always keep in stock.  We have the class blue bull one, sugar free.  And the blue version similar to this (that I like a little more most days).  And we buy one tart blood orange product.  This product is popular with friends and family and important to keep in stock.;positive
"It takes a bit of getting used to because the starches work differently when the spaghetti is cooked. My advice is to eat it with a flavorful and thick or chunky sauce, like a tomato sauce, rather than a mild or thin sauce. If your issue is celiac disease or avoiding gluten, you'll be happy with this; but the calorie count is similar to regular wheat pasta, so it's not a good option for dieting. It's also interesting that the volume of the cooked product doesn't increase as much as regular wheat pasta. The flavor is great, and not really quinoa-like (which I sometimes find bitter).";positive
Feels and looks and tastes like regular cane sugar. I love that it comes from the beet, which is not a plant similar to a grass plant. (I have stomach issues with cane sugar and grains that come from grass type plants.);positive
Very good loved it;positive
Has a lighter, sweeter, candy like taste than the more robust darker maple.  Either will do as they both have that unforgettable fresh alive maple taste than the DEAD taste of non-maple syrups made with HF corn syrup.  There is NO comparison.  Tried them side by side.;positive
THIS IS THE BEST HABANERO HOT SAUCE IN THE WHOLE DAMN WORLD! If you don't believe me... you are wrong.. I spent years looking for this stuff.. I had it one time at a friends house that was from Ecuador somewhere. I spent the next 15 years looking for it, and could never find it again. I'm a bit of a habanero connoisseur, but that was mostly due to my search for this stuff again. Now that I found it, I will never ever buy anything else. Just try it people.. Id give you my Carne Asada taco recipe and you'd have everything you need to die happy, but I guess I won't take the time .. Sorry!;positive
Fresh & fragrant!;positive
I love dark chocolate and pumpkin seeds are so good for you, this combination makes for a great snack, Take out a midsized pieces and that is enough for a mid afternoon snack.  Just don't have them delivered in Phoenix from May thru October - they will arrive melted - LOL. But I expected that.  I will have to go without until later in the year.;positive
I have both milk and soy allergies, so it's rare that I can find processed chocolate treats to eat. It's even more rare that those treats are something you'd want to eat. These cookies provide a satisfying crunch and have a texture that I would imagine is close to that of a Chips Ahoy (I don't know that for sure, but from comparisons, it seems crunchy, but not brick-like...it's definitely not chewy). The cookies are a medium size. Much bigger than the soft baked ones from Enjoy Life, but not as big as you'd find in a restaurant. The two to a pack size is a nice compliment to a packed lunch. It's one of the better Enjoy Life products...I find them to be hit or miss in general. It's no substitute for a homemade cookie, though. Of course, that's probably not what you're looking for in a quick pack! Certainly light years beyond the soft cookies in their line-up in terms of flavor, texture, and value.;positive
fast shipping great product;positive
A very good value in that the amount for the money is generous. The quality seems fine as well. Delivery was ontime but the lid was cracked. I used the product anyway as it was not really unsealed but someone might want to be a bit more gentle.;positive
Very tasty stuff!;positive
Works well on skin.;positive
"We use a lot of yeast. It is far, far  cheaper to buy it in two lb quantities than in supermarket foil wrapped packages or jars. Indeed, it brings the cost of the yeast down to pretty much negligible per dough instead of $0.65.

Although these quantities are foil wrapped and packed in nitrogen, it is better to order a years supply when the weather is cold, as heat is severely detrimental to the lifespan of yeast. I try to avoid transportation over the hot summer months just as a matter of course -- I have no specific knowledge that it is harmful. I keep a couple of lbs in the freezer, and have never noticed any degradation over time. In my lab we used to freeze dry bacteria, and keep them in a freezer, where they remained viable for years.

I make sub allocations which are kept in the kitchen freezer for daily use.";positive
really good tea.;positive
"Our family has been Gluten Free for 5 years. Ive tried practically every GF pancake or waffle mix on the market. These are our favorite brand! We make ours with coconut oil and coconut milk due to a dairy allergy. We end up with the fluffiest pancakes. We make ours even better by adding in Enjoy Life chocolate chips.

Took off a star because I do notice a quality difference when ordering through Amazon vs buying a box at the grocery store.";positive
"There is a lot in this bag!  I watched the video from the manuf on how to use the tea.  It looked like about 5 stems per cup.  If this is correct it makes a lot of tea!  It has a nice mix of stems and leaves and flowers, all the same length, about 2"" long.  I follow the directions on the video and boil for 5 min and let sit for 5 min.  Flavor reminds me of camomile.";positive
I absolutely love this stuff.  Its better than sugar although at 60 calories per teaspoon its not the best if you want to lose weight but it is still better than using white sugar.  The best thing out there to replace sugar that really tastes like sugar is Whey Low and its much healthier at 4 calories a tsp.  But I will still use the agave nectar.  Too bad its not cheaper and available in the supermarkets.;positive
"The taste is good; chewy, sweet. My complaint is that they are too soft and fall apart (get mushed inside the package sometimes and also while eating them). With kids (and adults) this becomes messy. I like the ingredients, no dairy, no gluten, no bad stuff, which is why we order them regularly.";positive
Great tase and interesting shapes.;positive
Taste great and it's gluten-free;positive
I love this stuff. My wife isn't as pleased as I am. We use it as iced tea. It has a strong citrus flavor, and that is probably the reason why she doesn't care for it. We use it as a change in tea's, since ice tea is all we drink, we go through a pot of tea a day, and Mr. Earl is a good change up for us.;positive
nom nom! these are so fabulous!;positive

"Very nice variety pack. If you are away from your microwave, or don't have one, you will welcome the fact that these pouches heat in three minutes in boiling water. I sampled the red kidney beans curry last night, over rice. The tomato and onion sauce was tasty. The beans were softened but firm, and not dry.

Unlike some Indian imports, it just lists ""spices"" in the ingredients. Ginger and garlic are listed separately.

Each pouch yields two and a half cups, a decent amount. Unless you are a hungry hiker!

If you'd like it spicier, I recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sanskriti-Artisan-Pure-Natural-Spices/dp/B00K0EFMPO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sanskriti-Artisan-Pure-Natural-Spices</a>.";positive
I make my own syrup at home but this year which would have been an excellent year for Maple Syrup I was too lazy. So I hate to buy it but I had no choice. It was worth it. This Maple Syrup is GREAT!!! I will buy it again if I get lazy next year.  Last night at about 11pm I made Waffles in the toaster. I really love this pure Maple syrup.;positive
I am really thrilled with this product.  I wanted to be able to make oatmeal in my slow cooker so that it was warm and ready in the morning with no hassles. I have done so in the past with old fashioned rolled oats and the outcome was always less than satisfactory no matter what adjustments I made to the water/oats ratio.  This attempt turned out perfectly the very first time, which most likely has to do with the 'cut' of the grain.  The ratio is 1 cup oats to 4 cups water on low for 8 hours (and 1 cup of dried fruit).  I added about 1/4 cup of quinoa and a total of 1 1/4 cups dried fruit (craisins, tart cherries, and goji berries) and 1 good sized diced Braeburn apple...no sugars.  I didn't use the spray 'Pam' product it tells you to put in the crock, but coated it with organic coconut oil which is solid at room temperature.  It was amazing...no sweetening needed to enhance the flavors.  My husband eats oatmeal every day and he really liked it too.;positive
My wife grinds these nuts in a blender, just enough to transform it to almond powder (too much blending and you'll get almond butter). This she then uses in place of flour to make the most delicious cookies (with other healthy alternatives to the usual ingredients).  I was quite surprised that one could use ground almonds for flour!;positive
The first time I tasted this popcorn it was a gift from Macy's during the holidays. Of course, it would not be offered anywhere after the holidays and I was glad that I found it here. The taste is exceptional and with the uniformity it makes it a great snack. This reminds me a lot of Cracker Jack but without the peanuts. The taste is borderline toffee but that does not take away from the overall taste. This is just good caramel corn and its a good comfort food snack.;positive
Starbucks changed their iced tea brand, and I hate the new brand!  Now I simply make one of these when I first wake up and pour it over ice!  Perfect!! Tazo has the cleanest tasting black tea I've ever had.  It's never cloudy, and this takes the guesswork out of how long to steep.  Perfect every time!;positive
"Fig Newton are my favorite cookie.  I always eat them with a glass of milk as recovery food after a workout.  I trained for 3 Boston Marathons with them.  I feel like they are healthier than most sweet snacks. I was ordering from Prime Pantry and used this as one of the items to fill up my box. They order came really quick and the prices are better than my local grocery store.

I have to say... these are the best ramen noodles I've ever had. The flavor is very different compared to other noodles and it is very easy to make. But if you like soup these might not be for you since you drain the noodles and then put the seasoning packets in the noodles.;positive
"I had some issues with getting my orders lately, but it was because of my mailman. I didn't get my package even though it was notified ""arrived"", I contacted the seller and told him/her about it. They refunded me without any problem, without doubting me or anything. Actually I really was looking forward this product, since a family member is really really loving it, we re-ordered and really were looking forward our healthy cocoa fix. Anyway, long story short, few days later, I finally got my package, no idea who was taking it in hostage but the enveloppe was ripped but the order was inside !!!! I thanked the Higher Power that allowed me to feel this moment of gratitude!! I emailed them back saying I am happy to pay for this product even though they refunded me, because we need to keep supporting great customer service, great products by giving them the money they deserve; it's how I felt about this product and Natural Planet. Will buy again but the size up next time, probably the pound! Yeah we're crazy obsessed with this cocoa powder, my mom says it's the best and she worked in a fancy chocolate store before!";positive
"We enjoy these more neutral flavoured crispbreads as they do not overpower anything we might put on them. As well, they do not break into bits in the box or in preparation, like so many gluten-free crackers. My grocery store source for these was inconsistent. Then they began to carry only the sun-dried tomato version. The sun-dried tomato crispbreads are fine, if that's what you want to taste... like if using with a cream cheese, complementary cheese or perhaps ham.
However, these plain ones are our favorites.";positive
"The first time I ever tried Matcha, it was almost a brownish-green color, which I eventually learned, is not a premium grade.  This DoMatcha was nearly 4x the price (ounce vs. ounce), but the quality is clearly way, way better.  Not only that, this DoMatcha tea gives me great energy, without any jitters or feeling spacey, like the other one made me feel.

I have always been a big Starbucks Green Tea Latte kind of guy.  I love those things to death.  BUT, the Vente would cost me $4.30 every day.  Even with the very high price tag of this DoMatcha, I can duplicate the same formula for almost 1/4 the price, and I can also use a sweetener of my choice, which is Xylitol.  I can keep it low glycemic, organic, and sugar free, and pay a fraction of the Starbucks price.  It's great.

My only beef with the DoMatcha is the packaging.  The tin is great, but the tea itself comes in a sealed silver pouch inside, which is VERY messy.  I eventually dumped the tea out of the pouch into the tin, but I probably lost 1/2 to 1 full serving in the process.  Powder was flying everywhere.  Perhaps I'll get better at the exchange in time, but that was the ONLY bad thing I have to say about this premium Matcha formula.

I'll definitely be buying again, but perhaps the 2nd Harvest one the next time, since it's about 1/2 the price, but still remains organic.";positive
"Wow fastest delivery in the west. And I had just plugged in my crock pot and was about to cook my 1 1/2 pound T-Bone steak stew for 2. But I had run out of onion powder. What housewife wants to deal with a ""bag"" of onion powder? I sure don't. So I will be ordering this from now on.";positive
Excellent assortment of syrups!  We have pool parties all summer, and the kids love these.  Last quite a while, and the flavors are great.  Originally tried these at Yogurtland, and found this sampler on Amazon.  Great find.;positive

IF YOU WANT A SMOOTHER TASTING VANILLA FLAVORED COFFEE, IN MY OPINION, PURCHASE TIMOTHY' CARNIVAL INSTEAD OF GLORIA JEAN'S VANILLA.  I RECENTLY BOUGHT BOTH AND GLORIA'S IS MUCH HARSHER...MORE LIKE THE STARBUCK'S TYPE.  EACH TO HIS OWN THOUGH.  THE GLORIA'S LEAVES A STRANGE AFTER TASTE IN MY MOUTH.;positive
Otherwise it's awesome tasting tuna.  It doesn't contain soy.  I wish tuna in olive oil would make a return to popularity so it could be easily available.  This tuna would be phenomenal if it came oil packed .;positive

"I prefer this ramen over all other type of Korean ramen. Yes, that actually says a LOT.

Let the truth be told, this ramen is caters to the non-Korean tastes. You normally cannot find this ramen in Korean supermarkets. You definitely cannot find it in Korea. But I really like it nonetheless.

I prefer this over Shin Ramen, which is the bestseller in Korea.

Pros:
1)Tastes better than any other Korean ramen.
2)Microwaveable in the provided bowl and highly convenient.

Cons:
1)Extra spicy. Not for those who thinks Sriracha is too hot.
2)Somewhat pricey.";positive
Great Buy !;positive
Loved them.;positive
"I love the ginger and lemon combination, and these cookies are favorites of mine.  Longtime favorites.  Two crispy ginger cookies sandwiched with just the right amount of lemon frosting.  I especially like these ginger cookies since they don't use the heavy spices, like cloves, which I heartily dislike.  If that's your style of ginger cookies, these may not be for you, but give them a chance.

One tip, if you prefer your cookies a bit softer, just empty the package into a cookie jar or tin, and they will soften in a couple days.";positive
This is wonderful tasting tea.  I love spearmint tea and was having a hard time finding it so I ordered this and I make a pot almost everyday.  I am having a hard time finding the right tea diffuser since it seems all the ones I have the holes are too big because I end up with a cup of tea leaves every time I make it but it doesn't stop me from making it and enjoying it.  I would buy this again.;positive
This is a good product however, I do caution consumers to consider if they need this much variety and tea. It takes up quite a bit of space unless you are an avid tea drinker. Additionally, ensure that you have a high-quality steeper as many of these teas include small particles in their mixes.;positive
Fresh, and wonderful;positive
Love this product, have ordered for myself three times and also sent it out for Christmas with a little bamboo tea whisk. Everyone loves and it last a lot longer than you would expect.  I think most people use only half of a teaspoon each cup.  Good hot or cold.  P.s I also made Green Tea Sugar cookies for the holidays....everyone loved those!!;positive
Love these and love this brand!;positive
My kind of coffee;positive
"What a great idea...something crunchy and sweet but healthy too!  My three kids love these, especially the youngest.  I had ""fruit snacks"", you know the gummy candy type snack and a bag of Sensible Fruit Tropical Blend the other day, and my youngest child begged for these crunch dried snacks!  A+ for this one! Thanks for thinking of this!  What else can be freeze dried and still be good???";positive
This has become our favorite flavor.  We like strong coffee and this one definitely is.  I brew mine to 16oz of water and it is still flavorful and hearty.  Be prepared to add extra cream, if you take it.  If you prefer a medium brew, Starbuck's Pikes Place is another good on.;positive
A lot of GF pasta I think tastes too different than regular pasta to really enjoy. This GF pasta tastes great, cooks a bit faster than regular pasta, and isn't nearly as expensive as most other options. The boxes are physically the same size as regular Barilla pasta, and tend to cost the same, but the GF version does include two fewer servings than the regular ones. Tricky marketing! But beyond that, it's great!;positive
I buy this shredded coconut all the time.  Never had a problem with it.  I tend to buy this one or the larger package of Bob's shredded coconut- http://amzn.to/1mE5WqG depending on what is available.  This is still a good value since it is only a couple cents difference (per ounce) from the other larger sized package.;positive
"I have used other Honeyville dehydrated products before so I chose their onions as well. They come in a nice canister which assures me they will keep dry in my pantry.
  I use these dehydrated onions for anything from spaghetti sauces to meatloaf.  It's less expensive than store-bought onions and, of course, less time consuming rather than having to cut up the onions. Great for casseroles too!";positive
Yogi is the besssst tea ever. It tastes good and helps control my stress levels and anxiety. Students would know what I am talking about :). My friend drives from a city 1 hour away just to drink this tea and says it tastes wonderful. I am very satisfied and would recommend this tea.;positive
Mmmmmm, these are good;positive
Yummy, keep the house stocked.;positive
"The panini was better but this wasn't too bad. I'd suggest putting some hot sauce on it, or dipping it in some salsa. Lean Cuisine meals all seem to lack seasoning in general, so it that wasn't really surprising. Adding some of your spices and such seem to be a common theme.

Side note, there was a decent amount of bacon. I wasn't expecting to have much at all considering how much it can inflate the nutritional facts.";positive
Love it Love it Love it;positive
PERFECT - WOULD PURCHASE AGAIN!;positive

"I don't use this for baking.  I keep the 32oz bottle stored in the fridge and drizzle it over vanilla ice cream!!!  I know it's a little extravagant but hey it's the bomb.

I also mix it in with eggs when making french toast!  The sweetness added is all you really need, of course you need creme fresh or a dab of unsalted butter!

You can also whip this into whipped cream for a pancake or french toast topping.";positive
High quality, rich tasting powdered milk.  I use it to make bread, normally.  But once, when I ran out of drinking milk, I made up a batch of this and chilled it.  Delicious!  Couldn't believe it.  Will happily use again.;positive
"For Valentine's Day, I purchase my family giant kisses.  It's a fun, appropriate, sweet reminder that I love them.

-This is four, 7 oz. individual, boxed and foil-wrapped chocolate, giant, solid, Hershey's kisses.
-This isn't Valrhona.
-It isn't Godiva.
-For those that insist that this is a small item, yes, ""giant"" is relative.  This description takes into account the size of a normal Hershey's kiss (0.2 oz.).  I suppose if you're used to eating over 2 lbs. of chocolate in one sitting, it would be best if you'd move on. ^^ All four items equal 2 lbs. of chocolate, that's 1/2 lb. each!
-This item was well packaged and arrived in a timely manner.
-Each kiss was fresh, in it's own box and had the classic foil wrapping with plume.
-For those of you worried about the price, you're paying less than a bag of kisses and you only need unwrap one. >.>
-Reviewers that were surprised that this was difficult to gnaw at with their mouths...really?  This item will require cutting away chunks to enjoy.
-The product is shipped with ice packs and I've never had one arrive melted.
-This item has never been returned to me when giving as a gift.  I've never had one person complain that they received a massive Hershey's kiss or about how awkward it was to eat it.  This is a novelty treat, people.";positive
"We LOVE Nick's Sticks! The turkey sticks taste so good. I love that there are two long sticks in each pack. These are perfect for road trips!
It *is* a hit to the wallet buying in bulk, I get that, but when you price individual chemical filled junk jerky sticks, even at WM, these are still a better deal!";positive
As always absolutely delicious!;positive
"I've used regular powdered peanut butter for baking in the past (not PB2 brand) and really liked it.  It stores well long-term without going rancid like the oils in regular peanut butter do.  It also adds a great peanuty flavor to cookies, cakes and pies.

I was happy to find this chocolate flavor available here on Amazon.  It's a little expensive at $10.99 per pound, but with free SuperSaver shipping for orders over $25 I decided to try it.  And since most recipes would use 2-4 tablespoons of powder, a pound will last at least as long as a big jar of regular peanut butter.

When my order arrived I was very happy to see that it is vacuum sealed in a thick mylar bag.  This keeps it fresh and dry for several years, if unopened.  I opened mine and followed the directions - 2 TBL powder, 1 TBL water, and mixed well.  It became a nice paste with a slightly grainy texture and delicious chocolate peanut flavor.  It was reminiscent of coffee, and not overly sweet.  It wouldn't be fair to compare it to full fat, mechanically mixed peanut butter, but I thought it was really tasty.

The best thing about this product is the reduced fat and calories.  I compared labels from regular peanut butter and PB2 chocolate powdered peanut butter and these were the comparisons (regular PB on the left, PB2 on the right):

Fat: 16 gm / 1 gm
Calories: 190 / 45
Carbs: 7 gm / 6 gm
Sodium: 150 mg / 70 mg
Protein: 7 gm / 4 gm

I'm very pleased with this product and will definitely buy it again!";positive
Great coffee syprup;positive
Wow is all I can say about this product,  I was elated to see that these grains shipped from a Michigan seller and arrived to my door in just 3 days.  The grains took 3 days to reactivate and I was greeted with the most fantastic fizzy and tart Kefir on the forth day.  I would gladly buy again, but hopefully these grains last me for many years to come.;positive
Very tasty not to hot;positive
Fantastic!  Soooo delicious!;positive
"Quick, easy, and healthy! Tastes good in my book, but I'm sure you can easily add some spices if you want.  I sometimes add a can of mixed veggies to get some fiber.  Also mixed with sauces for some extra protein and hubby didn't know! ;-)

cons - wish it was in a jar and larger amount for the price

will buy again though!";positive
"I bought my wife a pack of Scharffen Berger for her birthday even though a few of the reviews warned of poor packaging/delivery and a disappointingly average taste. However, one of my teachers raved about it so we had to give it a try. Before eating it, we read all about how they preserve the older chocolate-making traditions so that the chocolate keeps all the subtle flavors it inherently has--which put us both in a hungry mood! And we LOVED it. The chocolate is the healthy medium between brittle and soft. Also, there are so many  subtle, citrus-y flavors in the chocolate bar, we easily devoured three bars in two days!! The chocolate bars are about half a centimeter thick, 3 in x 8 in rectangles, patterned into easily breakable triangles that don't quite fit into your mouth for one bite. The most wonderful part of eating this chocolate is how nibbling only a small amount of the chocolate triangle releases a big taste, enabling you to enjoy small pieces for longer.
The flavor is not quite American and not quite European, but you definitely have to try it at least once!";positive
Big Red has been the only gum I chew since every other gum went to horrible sugar free ingredients that make their gum so sickeningly sweet you can't even chew it.  Big Red still has sugar and that nice bite to it that kills any garlic, onion, pepper whatever meal that you ate.  I used to still find it in the stores occasionally but now it is almost impossible - thank goodness for Amazon and being able to buy it online!;positive
Everyone who has tried them ends up snagging several, I'll need to buy another container much sooner than expected.  The only real negative I can think of these vs real sugar ones is that if you sit there and eat one after another they start to lose their sweetness / your taste buds adapt quicker than vs sugar.  So as long as you intend on using them to cut cravings vs gorging yourself they're great!;positive

"I really like unsweetened soy milk and I was thrilled when I saw this product on Amazon. Not only is it unsweetened, it's also organic, and you can get it for cheaper through the subscription service. It's super convenient to just get a box of 12 cartons or so every month instead of having to lug them home from the grocery store.

I did recently discontinue this subscription for two reasons. First, I saw that the regular store-brand unsweetened organic soy milk is cheaper per carton than this one (even if I factor in the subscription discount). Second, and more important, I wanted to switch to a soy milk that is fortified with certain vitamins (i.e. B12, since I don't eat animal products).

That being said, I really liked the taste of that one and the convenience of the subscription service.";positive
"absolutely positively the most atrocious stuff that you will put in your mouth... Firs impression was what monkey butt must taste like then it kind of ""mellowed"" into pure bile like vomit taste.... I loved it... will order again...

"This angel hair pasta is the perfect pasta for light sauces. Great flavor and it only takes a few minutes to cook. Paired with a small salad, and some grilled fish or chicken this makes a very nice meal! I love the texture and flavor, it holds onto light sauces very well. Light, thinner tomato based sauces go well with this pasta too.

For heavier, thicker sauces, we love Barilla's thick spaghetti and spiral pasta. We have always had good results using Barilla brand pastas.";positive

"I am diabetic so this syrup is a godsend,  First of all it is very delicious. I use it not only on pancakes and waffles but also

This Cacao powder tastes very good.  I use it in my smoothies and mix it in with my vanilla protein powder when I want chocolate flavor.  It's uses would be similar to the unsweetened chocolate powder you get at the grocery store, but this is the healthy version. I haven't baked a chocolate cake with it yet, but that's next on the list. It's a large bag and a good value for the money. I would buy this product again.;positive
I purchased this product as an alternative to the much more pricey Splenda.  As for its taste, I find it an acceptable substitute for Splenda.  The packets arrived in the manufacturer's box, which was then shipped in an Amazon box.  I did not have a problem with broken packets in the box.  I am satisfied with this purchase.;positive
"Here's the thing. I like Sunbutter Natural on most things. Good with sandwiches. Good with pancakes. Good with apples - sometimes. I don't know what the deal is but the sugar is so irregular it seems?? It's like the recipe isn't quality controlled much.

Well when I went to use Natural in my recipes, they would come out disgustingly sweet. Like too rich the kind that make your forehead hurt sweet. I would cut the sugar in half for my no-bakes and they would still come out too sweet.

But the last time I made my no-bakes, I used No Sugar Added and they turned out delicious. The absolute best no-bakes I've ever tasted. The kind you could pack on a hike, but also take to a party - they were that good.

so I guess if you need an allergy free ingredient you can count on, this is it.";positive
This is my favorite k-cup of the moment! I love this coffee! It is the strongest, but still smoothest coffee k-cup I have tried to date. It has a decent amount of body as well, which is hard to find with k-cups. Revv was one of my favorites until I found this one. Revv is still good, but it is not nearly as smooth. This k-cup is somewhat reminiscent to pressed coffee, which I also enjoy. It is a very close second to that. I highly recommend Jet Fuel to those who want a strong and smooth k-cup with a decent amount of body.;positive
"I have eaten a number of Creamed Chipped Beef (which is the same thing as Creamed Sliced Beef)

With that said, I found this brand to be very good.  I gave it 5 Stars because the quality was great.  It was as good in my view, as Schwan Foods Creamed Chipped Beef, and you get a huge amount for a reasonable price.

The quantity may be off putting, but let me just say if you have any tupperware containers it easy stores in a couple larger sized ones, or a rubberband and plastic wrap over the can in the refrigerator once opened seems a good idea too.  That is what I'm currently doing with my can.

The Tupperware would yield to longer term storage.

Also another Reviewer here, suggested spooning it into ziplock freezer bags and freezing it, then microwaving the whole thing.
I have not tried that, but I just want to offer the suggestion, as 6lbs 10oz is a lot, and will take some time to eat.

I like it over biscuits or buttered or unbuttered toast is also good.  Try potato bread if you have not tried that particular bread with Creamed Chipped Beef.  It does a good job.

One reviewer here said he tasted becon in the beef(?) I dont' know where that assesment came from.  Chipped beef is salty (perhaps like bacon can be) but I really dont' taste any bacon.  I taste a processed (salty) type beef underneath the creamy gravy.  That's what I wanted.";positive
We are popcorn lovers. We have everything from easy and quick microwave popcorn to a popcorn machine. I'm convinced this is the popcorn salt that the theaters use.

Just smelling the contents of this bag when I poured it up for storage had me dreaming of coconut macaroons, layer cake and coconut merengue pie.  8 grams of fiber for two tablespoons, this would make a great thick coconut milk shake, smoothie like an almond joy, just add almond milk cacoa powder and coconut flour with a sweeter of your choice, yum.  A little goes a long way, so mix with almond flour for baking because it is dense, say 2 tablespoons max per 1 cup of almond flour.;positive
Fine taste;positive
Very good!  Low carb food.;positive
Are advertised;positive
This is a really yummy oat bran.  It is simple to make - 2 cups water and 2/3 cup oatbran to make 2 servings.  I add a little Ceylon cinnamon and raw cocoa for more heart benefits.  I drop in a couple of walnuts.  It's comfort food that's good for you!;positive
they taste so good;positive
Bought this for a salt grinder.  Thank goodness pink Himalayan salt has become trendy, because with the two kilos I just bought, I'll be using it forever!  It seems to be a little more course then other grinding salts I have purchased, but it works fine in the grinder if you have adjustable settings.;positive
"Having Celiacs is not easy especially when it comes to finding good food; let alone good desserts other than the common and over rated flourless chocolate cake that typically tastes like cardboard! I would take these cookies 10x's over that cake any day and then some! These are tasty, lemon-y, buttery and delicious. I can't get enough of these....hoping for more flavors to come but these are great as are the Almond shortbread ones by Shari's too! You won't be disappointed in either one as long as you enjoy lemon or almonds.";positive
...these are the nuts for you.  Emerald nuts are super crunchy and more tender (more of a light snap when you bite into them vs. having to bite down hard) than Diamond almonds.  I always thought I didn't like almonds much until I tried the Emerald brand!  I've tried three varieties so far and they all have a really nice crunch.  I only gave this product 4 stars because I'm not really a chocolate fan.  But hey...I'm a girl, and every once in awhile I have a choc. craving.  So this is a healthy way to satisfy it.  :-);positive
My grandson loves Reese's pieces but the original kind doesn't always travel well in warm weather.  These are the perfect solution because they taste great but do not tend to melt in warmer weather.  Also, the smallish packages allows him to share and still keep plenty for himself.  They also stay fresher than keeping an open box around his room.  He loves them!!;positive
Awesome healthy snack!;positive
I love Mandarin Oranges, and was excited to find this 6-pack at a very fair price.  The oranges have good flavor, and are in alight syrup and don't have the flavor of lots of added sugar.  I like to make a salad consisting of spinach, slivered almonds and these oranges dressed with a vinaigrette dressing, which everyone in the household enjoys.  I also use them in a sweet and sour chicken recipe which is light on the sugar and heavy on flavor.  And, I'm not gonna lie, when I want something sweet, but don't want to consume too many calories, I'll just eat an entire can of these all by myself.  Sure, it's not ice cream, but it does enough to calm my sweet tooth down.  I have these on Subscribe and Save, and am happy to just keep getting them.;positive
Every 18 weeks or so I order another shipment of Wholesome Sweeteners' Organic Black-Strap Molasses.  That's about how long it takes me to use up the previous shipment of 6 bottles.  I order that many to qualify for free shipping - - that's what makes it a really good buy.  I really haven't had problems with the shipping.  Once in a while there's a bottle which is slighly leaking, but a little hot water with a sponge deals with it.  I religiously use the Molasses in everything from tea to coffee to baking.  I recommend it.;positive

Not only is this cracker a favorite of our family, but a favorite of my one-year-old nephew, as well.  Grandpa and Grandma now keep a stash of these on hand at their farm for the three little grandchildren (7, 5, & 1).  Everyone enjoys the Late July Crackers and we can feel good about the selection due to the care in making them.";positive
Very pleased as always.  Thank you;positive
"Having food poisoning is not fun especially the liquid that passes threw you. I bought this after my friend who is an EMT, told me you just lost half your body's water due to diarrhea, your going to need to drink an electrolyte. He hands me this an i drank it, everything went back to normal, no problems since. This my go to for dehydration for both out door's & the terrible dreaded diarrhea!

I recommend you buy 2 cases  :)";positive
"This is my favorite chocolate. I love the hint of orange flavor. It's very smooth and creamy. I just let it melt in my mouth. It's pure heaven...mmmmmm.

It's hard to find in the local stores. It's very seasonal, and not many stores carry it. When I do find it, the price is usually $3.99 each and they would occasionally go on sale for $2.50 each.

They used to have a raspberry version that I liked even more, but that is nowhere to be found. (I don't think they make it any more).

I don't like the dark chocolate version. I prefer milk chocolate over dark chocolate in general.

The only problem with this chocolate is portion control. I have a hard time not eating the whole darn thing in a single day! LOL";positive
Boyfriend loved this big snack pack. Lots of variety and it contained plenty of stuff for the price I paid. He was thrilled to receive this and see all the different snacks. This would be a great care package for a college kid or a friend/family member in the military.;positive
"These are wonderful.  Much more robust flavor than the standard Quaker Oats.  I cook these in my rice maker and they are wonderful.  I usually start them the night before so they are all ready for breakfast.  I am a big oatmeal fan so I am picky.  You will love this product.

Tom";positive
If you love hotel waffles, then this is what you want! We are on our secound order and we couldn't be happier with this stuff! So easy to make! Just add water and whisk! Pour on the griddle and wala! Perfect waffle! Every time! Who's hungry?;positive
Nice quality. So grateful. Thanks!;positive
Great price and just what I needed.;positive
"Overall great for coffee on the go!

Pros: Mixes well in cold water. Great flavor, taste much fresher than other brands instant. Great idea for care packages for the coffee lovers out there unable to get a fresh cuppa joe.

Cons: A little sweeter than I prefer. I would say its closer to two sugars.";positive
My preschool son has allergies to dairy and wheat, so we are always looking for tasty products for him that won't trigger an allergic response.  These chocolate bars are one of his favorites, and my husband and I enjoy them too.  So glad Amazon carries them now!;positive
I tried the regular Awake Milk Chocolate bar when I saw it at the check-out registers at Wal-Mart. I do have an obsession with Owls, so I'm going to be honest and tell you that is the main reason that it caught my attention. ( lol)  I tasted it and it wasn't bad at all. It did give me the caffeine fix I needed at work! I decided to look online if they had them in bulk, and I came across the Caramel Chocolate Bar. ( Which I prefer way more than the regular chocolate bar). It wasn't grainy like the regular bar and it's very smooth and tastes like a Cadbury bar. :-) It truly does give you the caffeine boost you need at work or school. I highly recommend this product. I do think it's over priced for 12 bars though. I'd be happier if they sold it for around $15 dollars a pack, instead of $22!;positive
Got started on these at a cafe that had them in the front...2.00 for like 1.5 oz. I was buying those too often so it made sense to buy this. Yes it's 5lbs, but they will last a while and I eat them every day. I found out they might help with digestion...so plus for me since I eat them as candy. Less calories and better for you than most candy. Just a slight ginger bite...not like the heat you get from a fresh root, but just enough to wake up the taste buds.;positive
good product work well;positive
I have tried almost all of the Pukka teas and I adore them!  They are all well blended, balanced and smooth.  It is nice to have found a company that makes such quality herbal teas!  I gave After Dinner four stars only because it isn't my favorite, but I do drink it and enjoy it very much!  It is a lovely post meal tea that has more body than I had expected, which was a nice surprise.;positive
I recently tried this after normally buying Caribou or Barista Prima brand decafs... I'm liking this brand better...and seem to be going through more of it during the day...so there lies the evidence. I won't attempt to desribe the taste other than to say it's good.  Bold simply means that the cup contains more coffee than normal...;positive
good tee..;positive
This was a challenge to find in the health food and grocery stores so I was glad to see it on amazon. The cinnamon flavor is great with fruit, coffee and for baking. Love that it is a healthy natural sweetner.;positive
Love my Groats!  If you get free shipping and eat groats regularly, this is a great deal.  I cannot get them in my local grocery stores so I really appreciate being able to get them here for what I would spend in the store.;positive
I LOVE this product!!!  Having used many other top-brand almond flours, I can honestly say this is my favorite. For baking, he consistency is perfect, and I find all my coffee cakes bake evenly and thoroughly.  Other brands often left my baked goods mushy or wet in he center.  Not Wellbee's - I've switched to the 5-lb bag, because I like it that much.;positive
Good to the last drop!!!!;positive
Perfect breakfast sandwich!  After heating for 90 seconds on 30% power, I check to see what needs to continue heating - often only the egg and one side of the english muffin.  Otherwise, it tends to overcook per package instructions.;positive
Plain and simple. The taste is ok, I mix it in my morning fruit shake. The energy is gives me is impressive. Really. I felt the difference literally from the very first drink. And when I run out, before the new container arrived there was a two or three day break and I felt different. Maybe the positive effect is all in my head, because I had high expectations, maybe it is 100 % real benefit, but as long as I can drink a little scoop and feel like I can go through my day and not be exhausted by 6 pm, I am golden. The only thing I don't like is the first container cost about $17.99 and the second one, about a month later cost $19.99... What's with raising the prices AMAZON?;positive
They all were eaten and enjoyed;positive
I got a variety pack of K-cups with my new Keurig and this is the only one I have liked.  The others all had a funny aftertaste, but this was perfect. It was about as close to the Senseo Paris flavor as I have found.;positive
"I am quite disappointed.  I read the reviews about this coffee from Cameron's that had received a 5 star rating.  When the coffee arrived the bag was evidently open and you could plainly smell the aroma of coffee.  I am sure that whoever packed this bag of coffee could also smell the aroma of coffee escaping the bag and indicating a faulty seal, but they shipped it anyway.  I ordered premium coffee and I got coffee from an open bag that had been slowly going stale for God knows how long.  This is not what I payed for and certainly not what was advertised.  Where was the quality control ? Who checked this order ?

Update: Amazon replaced the order of course, and the coffee is quite good for a medium roast.  As a matter of fact I get it shipped every 2 months and I blend it with another French Roast and it is almost as good as Back Country Roasters Cowboy Mud (excellent dark French roast)";positive
Great nuts very crunchy and fresh;positive
I use this product only for basmati rice, and it works wondefully! It is organic, grass-fed, and I love it! I have had it for about 2-3 months, and only 1/3 of the can is gone (this is with rice being cooked every single week). I did not taste ghee in rice (it was  a problem with other brands). Great consistency, taste, smell, I will buy it again.;positive
Good stuff. Using it right now.;positive
Always satisfied with this brand.;positive
Bob's Red Mill nutritional yeast has a slightly nutty, cheesy flavor. I've never used it as a cheese replacement, but it can add a lot of flavor to meats, garlic toast, pasta dishes, and pretty much any savory foods. I don't have much experience cooking with it, so I'm sure I haven't used it to its full potential, but it's made a good addition to my pantry.;positive
Gear flavor without the alcohol.;positive
"I got this and another brand (Fat Daddio's) because of the reviews.  Hands down - this tastes sooooo good!  I was very shocked by just how good this is.  I really feared this would be gawd awful like most - but it has made me a believer.

I read some reviews that criticized this because homemade is better.  For those who are REALLY into baking - bless you for all of your hard work.  No doubt your marshmallow fondant is quite swoon-worthy.  That said - I do not have the patience or time to be fiddle foodling around and needed something fast, easy to work with, looks great and tastes good enough that it wouldn't ruin the cake.  This fit the bill and went above all expectations!!

I only bake four or five cakes a year.  If I can do this - so can you :-)  Enjoy!";positive
I usually drink rapadura in my coffee but recently tried maple syrup powder. It's a great flavor with all the good nutrition missing from refined white sugar.  I use 12 grams in my large mug of coffee with half & half from grass fed cows.  Yummy!;positive
I have been using this brand for years.  (I live in Arizona.)  I usually buy it at Costco, but we were almost out, so I used Amazon Prime.  We use it daily in smoothies and to sweeten tea and homemade yogurt.  I just wish they would put it on the recurring order plan.;positive
"After trying all kinds of gluten free pancake mixes, as well as the protein ones, I was disheartened. And then I tried the Buttermilk Flapjacked pancakes.

First off, these have no cloying vanilla or cinnamon flavor - just plain buttermilk. They are thick and fluffy, but have some texture to them. And they are gluten free, sugar free, high in protein, and contain heat-resistant probiotics. What more could one want?

The price on the large pancake mix is great. For the muffins, the direct price from Flapjacked is better.";positive
I've enjoyed the Mlik Chocolate Grove Square previous to trying out this new flavor, but upon trying the Salted Carmel was really amazed at how great it tasted. Defiantly worth a try and don't worry, the salted carmel is a nice added addition to the Grove Square lineup. It's not overwhelming and taste great!;positive
I LOVE Mighty Leaf Tropical Green Tea and buying 100 individually wrapped bags will last me just over 1 month! They arrive in a box and the packets are foiled wrapped. Fits right in my kitchen cupboard and I have 2 - 3 cups daily. Perfection!;positive
We have converted the entire household into an almond flour bakery! We all ( ages 6 to 46) love this flour - for breads, biscuits, pancakes, waffles, cookies, pies, and other desserts! The quality is fabulous and the 2 day shipping is so convenient !;positive
GREAT COFFEE, none better.;positive
"The Amore Tomato Paste with Garlic is really tasty, but pricy, thus the 4 stars instead of 5. While I hate wasting canned tomato paste (or anything for that matter), this is a more costly alternative, given that a can of tomato paste is about 39cents. It is nice to have on hand to stretch the spaghetti sauce or zing up meatloaf, chilli, soups and the like.

The flavor is good and rich, but for the price the tube is quite small -- about the size of a ""family sized"" tube of toothpaste. While it says ""double concentrated"" it is still only equivalent to about 2 cans of tomato paste.

The tube is a thick, foil/metal and the cap is used to poke a hole in the end. It should be refrigerated after opening, so I keep it in the veggie bin.";positive
My husband loves bangers and mash with mushy peas. He lived in London as a college student for a summer and got hooked on pub food. I can change a stressful day into a smile with these peas, a Guinness and bangers and mash or bubble& squeak...;positive
Family members love it.;positive
Good product, good seller.;positive
Makes great lemonade;positive
"Roast Turkey, Pastrami, Corned Beef and Roast Beef sandwiches, all with Swiss Cheese and sliced tomato are a daily happening in our household. For years we used, Grey Poupon mustard. We tried the Beaver brand HONEY Mustard and really liked it so decided to give this, the Sweet Hot Mustard a try. We LOVE IT. We try to minimize the Mayo for fat purposes so mustard is our condiment of choice.

Personally, what I like about this mustard is that the ""hot"" doesn't keep your mouth burning long after the bite. You get the heat, then you're okay, It's not going to make sweat beads on your forehead.

We still love Grey Poupon and this is not a true substitute for it. It's a completely different flavor. But if you're into mustard, go buy a bottle of this from your local grocer. Then, if you want to stock up you can always come back to Amazon for the six pack which may save you a few cents per bottle.

If you don't like the heat - try the Beaver Brand Honey Mustard. It's really good too.

Enjoy";positive
bought for a friend. does work good;positive
When I first bought my coffee maker, I decided to buy a sampler pack of coffee.  I tried them all, the last one I tried was the G.J. Macadamia Cookie flavor.  I thought it would be awful, but it really became one of my favorite flavors.  It is very smooth, has a great flavor.  I add a little creamier, it is a treat!  It is strong enough for those who like strong coffee.  It is not the coffee I drink every day, but when I want something special, it is what I buy.  I enjoy G.J. Macadamia almost as much as I enjoy Starbuck Pumpkin Spice Latte, only I can get G.J. all year!!;positive
If you are like me and hate water straight up, this non-sugary and mostly natural sub gives you just the right amount of flavor to start loving water again!  Loving all flavors!  Use two if you really want it tasty!;positive
This is pretty good stuff. I made a batch of popcorn trying this and was able to get pretty close to theater popcorn complete with greasy fake butter. I popped popcorn in a popper, not an air popper, but the kind that takes oil. I used coconut oil and added the stated amount of Flavacol, plus a little extra. Not only did I have no unpopped kernels, probably from the coconut oil instead of vegetable, but the popcorn did have a slight flavor. I topped it with some Redenbacher's butter flavored popping and topping oil. Was very close to what I remember from the theaters. A bag even this size will go a long way, it recommends half a tsp for each ounce of kernels. We tried 5 ounces and had a huge amount of popcorn. Will buy again!;positive
Good but overpriced.;positive
"Buy 2 Get 1 Free.  I checked current Safeway price for an 18 oz box of Special K and it's $5.99.  $11.64 for 3 boxes is a great deal.

If anyone has any qualms about ordering three large boxes, even at this bargain price, let me assure you, this seller sells only the freshest.  January 2019 was the expiration date on the last shipment of three boxes a week ago (2/14/18).  Wonderful deal.";positive

This organic garlic powder comes in a glass bottle.
Product is well powdered with no crunchy pieces in it as I have experienced with another company in the past.
ONLY ONE ingredient -- that is -- organic garlic -- nothing else -- no fillers.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND Simply Organic Garlic Powder";positive
i love these jelly beans.  arrived as scheduled. but!!! one bag had a rip in the side. the beans leaked out of the bag and the shipping box. th is left a trail of jelly bellies from lexington,ky up the walk way and across the porch. lost about 1/2 bag.;positive
No nut allergies in my house, but plenty in our preschool social circles. Having a case of this has taken a little stress out of my life. I really prefer the crunchy stuff, I don't think my 3 year old cares either way.;positive
great typhoon tea, I am glad it comes decalf. The regular typhoon is my favorite breakfast tea, and the decalf is great for evenings. I had this in England when I stayed w/ friends, they use this as they're everyday tea and don't really use any fancy teas. The round bag gives it better flavor and I don't mind there is not string. Using the string to depress the tea bag can turn the tea bitter.;positive
first of all, you gotta love the jar with its light blue checkered cap and the label with light blue/red lettering.  you open the jar (which is no small task) and get the aroma of delicious smelling sauerkraut.  you have to taste it straight out of the jar and then warm it to eat with brats and potatoes and you know you are eating some of the best germany has to offer. first time i've had sauerkraut made with wine.  it has it all, taste, texture, aroma.  will be purchasing again.;positive
"Use this all the time. This brand has the most solid cream at the top of can, which I use for ""vegan whip cream"". It is hard to find organic in the stores, and I like having lots on hand, so I buy by the case.";positive
I don't care too much for this as a soup-whether as an additive or by itself. However, I love this as a base for vegetable gravy. When I use this in my roux, I need only a smidge of butter-I think it's tastier. Not bad as a marinade base for chicken or tofu. Love tofu, but how bland can you get-this is great to add tofu soup, especially if you like a hot and spicy variety!;positive
I'm fat lol;positive
"WOW...I couldn't be more surprised or thrilled at this set of six different Ice Chips.

Lemon-absolutely delish! I have already ordered another

Peppermint-Normally I hate peppermint but it came in the set so I thought I'd give it a try I could not believe how very YUMMMMY the peppermint was. Not to minty but just enough to cleanse your palate and so darn good I wanted to keep eating them-I could not believe how very good these Peppermint Ice Chips were. I already ordered another of these too.

Berry - Not bad; not fabulous but I'd give it a good FOUR STAR! Pretty good taste.

Cinnamon - Very 'hot' but good. I love Cinnamon flavor and these were really true to form.

Licorice - yummy, if you love Licorice you'll be thrilled with this one.

Root Beer Float -- Magnificent....The flavor is true to form-just like a root beer float.

All of the ice chips are different shapes, sizes and I break off a teeny piece (so as not to eat too much and end up in the bathroom) and I still get the flavor so basically in a word;
SCRUMPTIOUS!!!!!.";positive
This product is amazing! I have tried other brand names with Bacon Jerky and they got nothing like this! I was a but skeptical at first and as opened the pouch. The smell alone is real good. I took a nice piece and let it settle in my mouth. Nice mix of Brown sugar and bacon. The meat it self was nice and tender, NOT DRY like other brands. I like my jerky a bit juicey and this one is by far the best Bacon Jerky i have ever tried! I just wish they sold this in the gas station. Lol super recommend this and will be buying more for gift!;positive
yummy... love it;positive
Fast delivery. Good book.  Love it!;positive
"I first bought this cracker at a local store, because it was gluten-free and buckwheat, and I like buckwheat. I did not expect to like it as much as I did (I thought the taste would be similar to that of rice cakes, and was ok with that), but the texture is unique and the cracker is very crispy and light--you could eat a box and not know it. I also enjoyed the mild, wholesome flavor, and have found it to be a great match equally with sweet or savory toppings, such as: Whole Foods' self-serve honey peanut butter; Trader Joe's cookie butter; Key Ingredients Hot Horseradish and Ale cheese dip (which I get at WF); a very nice quality, Spanish tuna (like Ortiz Bonito or Cuca Ventresca); or some creamy goat cheese (which I get from TJ's) topped with some capers and a nice smoked salmon.. : )  When I found these crackers on Amazon, I immediately bought the multipack. After discovering my favorite way to snack on it--with some thin slices of Trader Joe's goat brie and a thin drizzle of raw, organic honey on top--I came back and ordered 4 more. I had originally also purchased a multipack of the Quinoa flavor, but the Buckwheat is my favorite of the two. In comparison, I thought the quinoa lacked flavor and was just the tiniest bit saltier (but keep in mind that both are almost completely sodium-free). I will also share that we had a visiting relative who went through 6 boxes of both of these crackers, without being on any kind of gluten-free diet, so this is a great cracker that anyone can enjoy. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys simple, natural, healthy-tasting foods with few ingredients (and low sodium), or who is looking for the perfect cracker that goes with everything and frames it with a great texture without clashing or eclipsing it in any way.

I usually get my cans of Illy Pods through the Illy a casa program, but I was between shipments and needed some espresso, pronto! This was the perfect pick me up until my next box arrived - Amazon to the rescue!;positive
This popcorn pops into large fluffy yet crunchy kernels.  It is out favorite of all the Amish kinds of popcorn.  One thing to note, the hulls do not bother us, but beware if you are looking for a hull-less popcorn--this is not for you.  The kernels will pop with hulls.  That being said, it is still the tastiest crunchiest! Love it!;positive
I bought these for my son, that he can have a quick snack when he have a free minute at work.  These are nice small 1 oz. serving of great peanut. Just the right amount of salt and a very convenient snack with out a sugar high. :) :)  Great product and fast shipping :) :);positive
Love these chips. My wife is a coconut freak and doesn't like them (I bought them for her). I am not a huge fan of coconut products, but do like Almond Joy and Mounds. These chips taste like that (minus the chocolate of course). I am happy the wife didn't approve. I think they are delicious and am now subscribing to get them on a regular basis.;positive
Two ounce is a perfect size for a snack pack.  The one ounce size is just not satisfying, while two ounces is actually sort of filling.  These solve the problem of buying a big bag, and eating half of it while watching a football game.;positive
This is the absolute best vanilla extract I have ever tried! I was a little worried about the other reviews saying the Mexican vanilla had a smokiness to it, but I would describe it as sweet, almost similar to Tahitian vanilla beans. I don't think I can ever go back to bourbon Madagascar beans after trying this.  Also, it has no added sugar or artificial ingredients which is a must for me.  I used it up way too fast.;positive
an excellent avocado oil;positive
I wanted to know what Blue Potato chips taste like and decided to try these.  They are very good. Light and not greasy. I have to get single serve bags or I would eat too many!  Givevthem a try if  you are an adventurous eater.;positive
the taste is great!!!;positive
Delicious, although a little sour.;positive
I really love these cappuccino pods! This is the only brand Ive found that can make cappuccino sweet not bland where I have to add extra creamer to it. I am typically not a coffee drinker u less its sweet so my review is based on my own preference. My coffee drinks are definitely more sweet additive than coffee flavor. If you are the same you will enjoy these pods! Yum!;positive
Best flavor and price;positive
This bar can taste a little waxy but one is pretty filling. I always eat one at the end of the day as a little treat to myself. If you can keep to just one bar at a time, it's a nice little 100 calorie dessert to indulge in!;positive
Never fails me. This is my go-to heart when making fresh bread. It always rises, even when I think it has been in the cabinet too long. I keep it in a dark/cool area and I always try and reseal it as tight as possibile.;positive

"I love barley in soup, whether turkey or beef soup.  I also felt that I needed to start cooking healthier grains with our dinners, and so I ordered this product.  This barley is rolled flat, which makes it cook faster - about 11 to 12 minutes.  The grains are fairly large, which gives them nice texture.  It has a somewhat nutty flavor.  Cooked alone, my sons thought it was ""OK"".  With sauteed onions and other veggies, pilaf style, they liked it.  Note that the box instructions call for basically no salt, which leaves the barley tasting a lot like paste, but when cooked in broth, it takes on the flavor of the broth.

I also recommended this to a friend who has to cook barley for a dog with intestinal issues; she says the price is better than that which she finds locally.";positive
"These are a great in your car, purse and gym bag protein snack.  I love the size and the ingredients.  Perfect for when you need something
a little sweet, but want to keep calories in mind and focus on the good things.";positive
After reading some of these reviews, I decided to sample this again. I'm still a big fan of the salsa, but in light of some of the comments, I evaluate it differently than before -- I think the salsa was spicy, but I think now that it's the garlic taste that lends a lot of the spiciness to it. That, in my book, is no small thing, because this is the first salsa I've seen (unlike, say, tomato sauce) that highlights garlic. I think they got the level of garlic just right, here. I'll have to give the Muir Glen chipotle salsa a try. Let me add too, that I think the Muir Glen pizaa sauce is rich and spicy, while their tomato sauce is very bland, so it's hard to generalize about their tomato based products, anyway. Also, this salsa is not crunchy at all, which is a feature some people like and some don't. I think it's a point worth mentioning, though.;positive
"Works for me! 

So, okay: I'm vegan, I use this with rice or with elbow macaroni pasta. Along with sea salt, extra
virgin olive oil, and McCormick's garlic powder and onion powder, both of which are available in
this large size. I don't use huge amounts of curry. I don't make fancy dishes with it. I'm a simple
person; I like simple food.  

I had saved a bunch of the smaller size Simply Organic glass bottles, and I decanted the garlic,
onion, and curry powder (separately) into those. I'm single, and my cat doesn't eat curry  ...
so these larger sizes all last me a pretty long time.

I haven't tasted a lot of curry powders, but I would venture to say that this is probably on
the relatively milder side. It's not bland, it's not super-hot / spicy. It's just right (for me).

One caveat, sort of:  This IS a true 'powder'. My garlic and onion powders are the granulated
type, so they're free-flowing. I couldn't find any granulated curry powder here; I don't know if
anyone even makes it.

This stuff is the fine dry powdery type. In damp or humid weather, or possibly for longer periods
of storage in general, I was always taught to put in about a teaspoon (more or less, depending
on the size of your container) of UNCOOKED DRY WHITE RICE - in salt, for example, or in other
dry/fine powders, to absorb any moisture, which helps avoid clumping, at least to some degree.

I love peanut butter in any form, cookies, fudge, smoothies, spoonful. So I am not the best one to grade Jif. But I love it. Sometimes a snack in the evening can be just a piece of toast, buttered with a spoonful of PB. Yum;positive
"Everyone has a different taste when it comes to coffee, but this coffee is great. Smooth taste not bitter not acidic medium blend and you can't beat the price from Amazon.
I have found my coffee for life and trust me I have tried many different ones.";positive
I love this spice combo. It's great on so many things. Just be creative and try it on all sorts of things. If I have an avocado that I eat by itself, this spice goes on it and I add a bit of cayenne. It's great for adding to cucumber, onion, vinegar olive oil salad. Yes on eggs. Just really a great blend.;positive
vwry tasty;positive
OH MY GOSH where have these been all my life. I love these so much, I am totally addicted to this barely any calories make me feel good snack.  I don't know if they expand in your stomach but I feel really full for awhile after eating these, plus I feel like they give me energy. I will never be without.;positive
Great, tasty, lightly crunchy peach slices are great to munch, and broken up in my oatmeal they revive to juicy bits of fruit. I watch the subscribe and save price fluctuations and order extra when the price drops a bit, and skip them if they're too high that month, getting another variety instead. Every fruit and veggie these folks put out is great..;positive
"If you're buying this because of the marketing as somehow greener than other k-cups for the Keurig coffee makers -- remember that even regular k-cups are mostly compostable and/or recycleable.  (They are, after all, mostly made of coffee and foil).  These have such a heavy-weight plastic collar to hold them in place (much heavier and harder than a real k-cup) that the amount of plastic is almost identical.  And to make the compostable part of these actually fit for the compost pile, you have to separate the plastic and foil from the coffe and mest.

Which is a lot of work for something so obviously designed to be fast, simple and easy.

But -- that said -- the coffee is tasty for an average cup'a joe, and they are significantly less expensive than the standard k-cups from mid--high end brands.  I've had no problems with the design being compatable with my machine.";positive
"I like this product very much, and appreciate the low cost. This review was originally a response to a one-star comment, and I figured I'd run it as a review.

I'm sitting here with a one pound jar of Now Better Stevia Extract Powder. Here's what it says: ""Certified Organic Stevia Extract Powder (Leaf). ""Verified Non GMO"" ""Certified by QAI."" ""US-ORG-050""

I looked up QAI: ""USDA/National Organic Program: QAI is a USDA-accredited certifying agency (ACA), approved to provide organic certification in accordance with the USDA's National Organic Program. Certification is important for consumers, the industry and the regulatory community in order to assure organic integrity from farm to retail shelf. A product marked ""certified organic"" means that an accredited certifying agency, such as QAI, has verified that the product labeled as ""organic"" is true to that organic labeling claim, as specified by the National Organic Program in accordance with the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990.""

China has a horrific record of distributing food that is badly tainted. And the USA now has to face how residents of Flint Michigan were assured that badly polluted water was safe to drink. Nothing is guaranteed. However, If a company in China is willing to jump through the hoops to get certified re Non-GMO and Organic, and their product passes QAI tests, I feel they're about as credible as companies here. Each of us has to make judgment calls on things like this. I live in the Northeast. Very dirty. Paper mills used to dump carcinogens in the water here. The apple trees on this old farm were sprayed with arsenic, which remains in the ground. The granite that makes this the Granite State is radioactive.

We do the best we can, we get old, we get sick, and we die. We juggle, we bargain, we make our trade-offs. We agitate for health, and that's all to the good.";positive
Don't let the name fool you into believing these are organic as it did me. They're not organic but are Non-GMO verified amongst a few other healthy options (non-irradiated, non-ETO). They also came in a bottle that looked way different than what I was expecting based on the photo on the item. Those 2 surprises, knocks it down to a 4 star product instead of 5.;positive
These cookies are wonderful tastes great and crunchy. We love all the Enjoy life cookies. I love these small packs of cookies I put them in my daughter's lunch box. I gave it 4 stars because at arrival all 24 packs were crushed.;positive
Tried Puerto Rican coffee while visiting there a few years ago. It was phenomenal, even at Burger King. I never forgot that coffee and decided to do a little research. I understand there are two Puerto Rican coffee plantations, and this is one of them. I am thoroughly enjoying the coffee, although I can't seem to get it like it was prepared there. Maybe I need to go back and learn more!;positive

Very tasty and so easy to use! We make machaca burritos with it but also used it to make tacos and a soup too. The beef is ground almost to a powder. I would prefer it to not be so powdered, but the flavor is great. I will buy it again.;positive
Very nice product for making homemade sauce.  It's a little sweeter than most tomato pastes, but I like that.  I definitely prefer it to some of the common supermarket brands like Contadina or Hunts.  I combine it with crushed tomatoes and spices and simmer on low for at least 30 mins.;positive
We are a gluten-free house now and this mix has been a life saver for my kids to transition off wheat products. Pamela's is kid-tested and has a high approval rating from them.

I've purchased them for over a year and I'm a happy camper whether I'm using them in my cooking & baking or for a snack.  I've not had any problems with expiration dates - maybe it's because they simply don't last that long :);positive

"I haven't found a better brand for taste and consistency. I go through many cans in a month. Do not waste your money on ""light"" coconut milk; it is just watered down regular coconut milk. If you want light, then mix your regular coconut milk with some water and lighten it up. You'll get more coconut milk for your money that way. I prefer to use mine at full strength though because I love the flavor and creaminess.

If the temperature is warm enough, your can contents may already be incorporated. Try shaking the can to see if you can here it sloshing around at all. In cooler temps, the coconut solids will separate from the water and you'll want to incorporate it all for use. The easiest thing to do is dump it all in a medium bowl and whisk or stir together.

Use suggestions:
-Add a few tablespoons to blender smoothies (adding healthy saturated fats like those in coconut milk help you absorb the vitamins and nutrients from any fruits and/or veggies blended into your smoothie).
-Make ""ice"" cubes to either add to smoothies or creamy Bacardi Coco drinks or melt in your coffee (a good way to use up leftovers before they go bad).
-Use as the creamy base in an ice cream batter, replacing dairy.
-Add to a chilled whipped cream dispenser (like iSi brand) and make dairy-free whipped cream (add sugar, vanilla, etc. to flavor if you like).
-Substitute for cream or milk in most recipes (I've even used it in quiche).
-Mix equal parts coconut milk and fruit jam/preserves to make a creamy & fruity topping for pancakes (heat it up if you like) or to spread on toast.
-Dump a can into a small pot as a base to a quick Thai soup. Add a can of crushed or diced tomatoes, slice in some mushrooms, add some Thai basil, and thrown in some cooked chicken chunks.
-Combine with other oils, lime juice, salt, pepper, seasonings, etc. to make your own salad dressings.
-Blend into soups or chili to make them a little creamy (I've even done this with salsa to get the creamy mouth feel of sour cream, although nothing gets close to the flavor of real dairy sour cream).";positive
This Teriyaki Beef Jerky tastes great. One downfall is that some pieces are nice and moist and chewy as i expect jerky to be, while others are hard and almost unedible. The dog comes running everytime I break out a bag of this stuff. Needless to say, he gets the harder pieces that tend to be painful for me to eat. Wish jerky was more affordable, but the Amazon prices seem to be very good, especially if you do a susbscribe and save where you get a shipment each month. Also wish it was available in a larger size bag!;positive
Not sure I had a good frame of reference for what 4 lbs of Brazil nuts would like but this is a BIG bag!!  No worry though, if you put them in the fridge, they will continue to last.  I eat about 6 of them per day to get my daily selenium intake(be careful not to eat too many though for fear of ODing on selenium).  The nuts are good and I'll likely buy a new bag once I get through the one I have now.;positive
So far, I have ordered rye flour, multi-grain rolled cereal, and various screens of corn meal.  All the products are very good quality, shipped in attractive and secure boxes and arrive in good condition.  What more could be asked?

"I have never cooked with Saffron.  I was aware of it's existence in the Universe and based on the coloration of the rice I have made in the past and the color of the rice while using this product, I'm sure I've eaten lots of foods with saffron included but it was not with foreknowledge.  Here's the short version, this stuff is great.

If you've never cooked rice with saffron and you're hesitant to pay the price for a small, 5g jar of saffron, end the hesitation, buy it and try it.  This is not a hammer, in the face spice like black pepper or salt but instead is a subtle spice that brings internal flavors together which has the effect of elevating the taste quality of the food being eaten.

Since I was inexperienced, I was clueless what to expect.  For my introduction to this flavor, I prepared a rice bowl, who's taste I was familiar with.  I boiled up a cup of water in the microwave and added a small pinch of saffron threads to the hot water that consisted of fifteen or twenty threads.  I allowed the threads to steep in the hot water while preparing the rice for the microwave or in total, allowed the saffron threads to steep for about five minutes.  The resulting, strong golden yellow tea was added to the rice mixture.  The measuring glass was lightly rinsed so as to retrieve all the threads and solution on the sides of the glass and the rinse water added to the rice.  The rice was microwaved.

My first impression was, okay, lightly creamy.  No overpowering odor or taste.  The saffron add was, the rice creation now had a full on creamy taste that was yummy compared to the nice but bland rice bowl I normally had been making.

Since the first use, I've made my low cal rice bowl five/six times (rice, chicken, garlic salt and black pepper) and this creamy flavor comes to the forefront, each and every time.  At this point, I'm addicted and can't imagine returning to the blandness of the past rice bowl creation.

My expectations as to frugality of the cost.....I expect to get maybe thirty bowls of rice out of this purchase.  Much less than the 120 or so servings that I've read about but for what you get, elevating the taste of a bowl of rice in this fashion, my opinion, this is money well spent and without hesitation, will be spent again.  The blunt version; anything to make my cooking taste better, I'm all for.

The above are my inexperienced first impressions.  To those who know saffron, you will know if my comments are spot on.  And to those who are inexperienced and looking at this review in curiosity of should you indulge yourself or not, by all means, do.  The result will be a subtle, blending of tastes that will elevate the mundane tastes a couple of levels to: Hey, this is good stuff and the only difference will be cutting back on pepper and the addition of saffron tea.

The product has no real smell to it.  Nothing but the light background smell of.....well, fresh saffron.

Overall, this is a product I feel comfortable referring to both experienced and inexperienced users and from all my research, this is a quality product at an excellent delivered price.

""Mangiare!""";positive
I only knock off 1 star because there must be higher quality white teas out there. For the price though I think it's a great value. I like the taste of this tea, it has some floral notes and a trace of sweetness. It has a honey-color to it. I've been using this brand for months now, but been buying it 1 box at a time, and I checked the exp date on each one and all was well. Same is true with this 4 pack I bought, 2 were dated 9/30/19 and the other ones 4/25/21. They arrived undamaged and were individually sealed and then a seal over the 4 together.;positive
Really good deal. You get a ton of easy small microwaveable  meals. I wish there was a variety pack though so you can have something different whenever. The only real downside is that it is kinda goopy, I wish it was a little drier.;positive
Gatorade is always good to keep in the fridge. I like to drink stuff that has flavor, but not a whole bunch of calories.

"This is my FIFTH order for these excellent cashews. They are unsalted. I mix them with SINCERELY NUTS salted cashews so the salt level is cut in half--hopefully. These cashews are 99 percent whole large cashews; very few pieces and no 'dust.'

If you are a lover of cashews then this is for you.
The price could be steep or reasonable-haven't purchased these nuts in a long time
but for 'whole' cashews these are truly 'whole' and delicious, fresh and crisp.

UPDATE: I've priced cashews at several stores and found that this is really a good and fair price....especially if you have Prime!  They really deserve a TEN!";positive

start these in your slow cooker in the morning, stir a few times in the day, and have a rich creamy batch for supper and more. ratio is 1 cup of grits to 6 cups of water. start the cooker and high but turn lower after a few hours. It looks like way too much water at first, but they thicken up beautifully as the day goes on. Beats other stone ground by a mile;positive
very very good.;positive
I'm addicted to these bars.;positive
it tasted very good.they went fast in my house. you would have thought i opened up a little store of my own. but ofcourse i didn't sell them. Even if i wanted to i couldn't because they didn't stick around long enough. i had no idea people loved them so much. it was only a 24 count box and they went through it in a day. Maybe they was just that good or people in my house are just big on snacks...lol either way i need to buy a few more boxes and save atleast one for only me. Yes, i know, they are just slim jims. but they make a good snack when your hungry. i like to eat them with cheese and crackers. its actually very tasty that way. All things considered,it was a good purchase. Just like the ones at the corner store but not as expensive.;positive
Da best;positive
I found these by accident in a convenience store.  I looked around for a cheaper price, and found this variety pack so that I could try them all.  So far, I have liked every flavor.  Great for a quick bite to eat in the morning, or to take to work for a snack.  I will definitely be buying more!;positive
"I use this salt in place of the ""traditional"" salts.  I prefer it because of the taste and the minerals contained within it.  In addition, the company graciously issued me a partial refund because I notified the company that in less than two weeks after I made my purchase I realized there was a sale price.  I appreciate the integrity of the company.";positive
"The best peanut butter I have ever eaten. I love the fact that I can make it whatever consistency I like simply by adding more or less water. I created a simple protein shake of my own devising.

Simple Peanut Butter Protein Shake

One Cup Soy Milk
One 1"" slice of Firm Tofu
Two tablespoons of this peanut butter

Add soy milk and tofu to blender and blend until liquid.
Add peanut butter and blend again just to mix.

Protein is 21g. Calories 245.

Note: do not substitute some other type of vegetarian milk as it won't give enough protein. Also, use firm or extra firm tofu because softer tofu makes the shake too runny and also because it has less protein.

This can be made in bigger batches and stored for up two 48 hours.";positive
Great packaging, tastes delicious.;positive
I enjoyed it a lot. It was strong and perfect. It lasted quite awhile as I didn't have to use as much as I do with other espresso. Keep in mind, this is very fine ground so it won't work in a Mr. Coffee Cafe Latte. Thankfully, I have a separate espresso machine that I can use.;positive
Delicious mix;positive
BOLD is a great word to use to describe this coffee. I'm a mocha/chocolate coffee lover and was on the hunt for another brand after the one I have used in the past has been continually unavailable. This coffee is delicious and has a strong coffee and bittersweet dark chocolate flavor. I personally need to add sugar to my coffee, and this roast wasn't an exception for me. I made it in my Keurig my K cup and it worked well. I am very pleased with my choice to purchase this coffee blend and will continue to do so in the future!;positive
Trust in Mc everytime!;positive
"This is a nice, dark cacao powder, and it's very finely milled.  I've used it in everything from vegan cheesecakes to nut clusters, and it mixes in well and imparts a good taste.

While the bags this comes in have a resealable closure, they stop working well once they get powder in them.  I store it instead in Rubbermaid containers to keep it fresh and easy to use.";positive
Yummy! Like I've written for the other Wiley licorice's I've purchased, I wish I had never discovered this stuff. I'm addicted. The flavors are nice. The product is quality. There's nothing in the US that compares.;positive
Had it been a bit less expensive, I would have given it five stars.  It just came in and I mixed some up in cool room temp water.  It tastes amazingly good at about 65 degrees, so I put it in the fridge to cool even more.  Wow, the difference between this stuff and nonfat dry milk is galaxy wide.  I'm going to start buying this instead of nonfat dry milk.  Hmm, how much does it cost?  Let's see, 24g per glass,  16.667 glasses per can, 5 glasses per liter, so roughly one gallon is produced per can.  Milk is $2.69/gal and this was $7.32, so that's 2.72 times as much as whole milk.  Given the convenience of having dry milk, I'd call that an easy wash.  Toss your nonfat dry milk, folks.  _PEAK_ is what you want in your cupboard.  There simply isn't a comparison.;positive
Very Fresh with great flavor!;positive
I am truly amazed that these are not greasy at all.  The taste is absolutely delicious with the right spices (although I would prefer a spicier version just for me).  I have already bought these again because I eat 1-2 of these for breakfast every day (and I'm not a breakfast eater).  My husband loves these too, so I have to share.;positive
Nice crisp organic apple chips.  Good flavor, texture, quality.  They are a bit pricy, but we love them and will continue to purchase this product.  It's a good snack without a bunch of additives and unhealthy ingredients.  Yum, yum!!;positive
"Ive tried countless protein powders but after reading an online review/comparison of 10 of the most popular on the market, the reviewer chose this one so I gave it a shot. I just ordered my 3rd tub. It ticks all the boxes and manages to taste good, fill me up, and dissolve super well in just nut milk alone. A scoop into some vanilla unsweetened organic almond milk with a bit of cinnamon in a blender bottle and Im good to go!!

Ive had issues with other products upsetting my stomach (gas, cramping, diarrhea, general stomach upset) and this has not once made me feel ill. Its great! Stomach approved!";positive
I have tried many vitamins for my 3 year old and we always end up back at these.  Why? He loves them! Getting my child to take his vitamin is easy with these gummies.  They don't stick to the teeth and have a great tart orange flavor. I even find my husband popping a few!;positive
good stuff and price right;positive
I'll give this five stars because the problems I had are in no way the company's fault. It came fast and packaged well and as described. My problem was that it has a pretty strong flavor. I was looking for an alternative to refined sugar for coffee and the various teas I drink. It changes the flavor of those things. (I knew this from reading other reviews and decided to try it anyway, my fault.) I did bake some muffins that I put this in and those were great. It didn't work out for me, but it in no way is a reflection on the quality of this product!;positive
This water has a good taste and a convenient container that is better for the environment.  My only problem is when USPS delivered it was in a plastic bag.  Reason, one of the containers had busted.  I'm sure USPS was a better choice for Amazon but not necessarily for their customers.  I am not returning as it was only one container but will think twice before reordering.;positive
I have tried Senseo and Wolfgang Puck medium roast blends and this product surpasses those brands for aroma, flavor and overall taste satisfaction.  Perhaps there are others that are its equal or better that I haven't tried, but this one is very satisfactory for me.;positive

"I think this worked better than the LorAnn cream cheese emulsion. I sell and decorate cakes under my state's ""cottage laws"". I am not permitted to use real cream cheese, so I had to find a tasty alternative that does not require refrigeration. I did a taste test on my family with real cream cheese, faux cream cheese with LorAnn cream cheese icing and another with LorAnn cream cheese emulsion. Everyone immediately recognized the emulsion has being the imposter. However, they had more difficulty discerning the cream cheese icing flavor from the reall cream cheese icing. I would follow LorAnn's recommended  usage to the ""t"".; you don't need a lot of it. I gave this 4 stars because I CAN taste the difference--although it is very subtle. I know that I can taste the difference because I make all my icings from scratch. I am certain that the vast amount of people will not be able to recognize the difference.";positive
"I love AmeriColor!
It's not even so much about the colors being better as it is about not having to dig a toothpick around a container. I'm one of those people who would forget that I'd already used my pick and stick it back in my Wilton color. The next time I opened it, mold would be growing on it. Talk about bummer. You have to stop what you're doing to go buy new.
These AmeriColor soft gels color fondant, buttercream, sugar cookies, royal icing, whipped icing (not really liberally, but they get the job done), and gumpaste. These are the best food colors on the market.";positive

"I live in San Antonio, Texas, where we have fabulous Mexican food on practically every corner. Soft bean and cheese tacos have been one of my family's favorite snacks and light meals for years now. We can buy lovely flour tortillas in every grocery store, but often the only choice for refried beans is the canned variety. If you've ever had them, you know they bear little resemblance to authentic refried beans.

I first had dehydrated beans when a Mexican friend told me that's what many restaurants use. The idea of dehydrated beans grossed me out til I finally tried them one day. Wow! The taste and texture of restaurant refried beans in only 5 minutes! These beans are fantastic and perfect for making soft tacos. My kids are hooked.

Initially, I was able to find the Mexicali Rose brand (which is delicious) in my local grocery store but now, I cannot find them consistently locally. After reading the great reviews for this Santa Fe Bean Company brand, I decided to order them. They are absolutely just as delicious as the Mexicali Rose brand! I've put them on Subscribe and Save so I never find my pantry bare of beans again.

For anyone interested, here's how I make quick and easy bean and cheese tacos:

Santa Fe Instant Fat Free Vegetarian Refried Beans
Store bought flour tortillas
shredded Fiesta blend cheese
shredded lettuce and diced tomatoes

Cook the beans as directed on the package. While the beans are simmering the 5 minutes, lightly brown some flour tortillas on a hot, flat griddle. (I put them immediately into a tortilla keeper so they stay warm.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tortilla-Warmer-12-Insulated-Fabric-Pouch-by-Camerons-Keeps-warm-for-one-hour-after-just-45-microwave-seconds-Sunface/dp/B0025UIDA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tortilla Warmer 12"" - Insulated Fabric Pouch by Camerons - Keeps warm for one hour after just 45 microwave seconds (Sunface)</a>) Once the beans are done, spoon a line of beans down the middle of a tortilla, sprinkle shredded cheese on top of the beans and fold in half - taco-style. You can also put some of the shredded lettuce and diced tomatoes on top of the cheese or serve on the side, as is the case in virtually all Mexican meals.

You can also substitute the cheese with Mexican rice and make bean and rice tacos, which are fabulous and filling and also make a complete protein.";positive

"I have yet to figure out the cooking exchanges compared to sugar, since xylo sweet is intense when baked. It seems exceptionally sweet when cooking, so using less is a plus. I have tried it in cooked puddings, brownies and cakes. The bakery items come out dry when following the recipes, so I still am trying to figure alternatives, like adding applesauce, bananas, etc.
The cost of this product compared to sugar is outrageous, but it is the best alternative for me so far since I have a bad reaction to sugar. (It makes me angry)
Mostly, I use it in coffee and cold foods like yogurt, and sprinkle over fresh fruits to add a bit more sweetness. I would give this product 5 stars if it were the same as sugar without the negatives.";positive
"I use this in yogurt and on cereal and fruit, but cooked with it for the first time: a dark chocolate syrup for ice cream and lattes. Wonderful sugar-like taste with no artificial aftertaste; great for the teeth, lower calories and carbs than sugar. One possible issue is that the granules are not as fine as sugar, so they don't dissolve quickly like sugar. But for me that is very minor.";positive
The best chicken seasoning ever!;positive
Best gummy bears.  I didn't realize I got 2 bags. Gave one to mom.  Her's was gone in a couple days.  Me I tried to pretend I was an adult and tried to limit myself to one handful a day.

"Used to keep dried pineapple as a staple, then it became difficult to find pineapple that wasn't full of sugar and sulfites. Discovered this pineapple from amazon and LOVE it! Hard to separate the pieces as in the photographs; it came melded into one big clump, but I'm glad that happened. I slice it, and it's similar to the shoe leather I loved as a kid (but I like this better than the usual apricot). It's the perfect snack when there's no time to eat, especially with a handful of raw cashews. FANTASTIC dried pineapple, and I'll again be keeping it on hand. Highly recommended (and very chewy).";positive
These are wonderful!  So often I'm hungry in between meals, or I'm too busy to stop and make something to eat.

"This tea is the best fruit tea I have had. I drink iced tea all year round also have spent a considerable amount of money looking for a true fruit flavor not something that tasted artificial. The picture on the box is very enticing but I am sure you all know that does not mean the product inside is good. For me it is ""LOOK NO FURTHER"" this is the real deal, give it a try I would be surprised if you were disappointed. It is also good hot!";positive
These are absolutely the best tomatoes I have ever tasted, perfect for sauce as is, and a great base for adding other ingredients for soups, pasta sauce, or eating with a spoon.  I chop up and saute celery, add the tomatoes, touch it with oregano oil, and add chopped basil for a fabulous sauce.  I'll keep buying this fantastically tasty product.;positive
My husband's favorite gran bar.;positive
I will buy this again;positive
I love this oatmeal. I am fairly new to the world of steel cut oats. After the first bowl, I never want to go back to eating the slippery, slimy regular oats again! These oats have a nice texture and a wonderful, nutty taste. It takes a while to make it on the stove (30 minutes to cook), so I usually make it  ahead of time and then save it in microwavable mugs with lids and then store it in the fridge until I'm ready to eat it. I heat it in the microwave for 90 seconds and then add a splash of cream, chopped organic dates, and raw, slivered almonds along with a couple of teaspoons of ground flax seed... and a little maple syrup to sweeten if you like (I do!). It is warm and filling and full of fiber and it's good for your heart! My husband and I both love this oatmeal. I had it on auto-order, but Amazon recently told me they would not be doing auto-order for this oatmeal anymore, which kind of bums me out. I will still order it on my own, though!;positive
Best fondant around.  It's easy to roll out, doesn't have that awful plasticky smell like the other brands and definitely has more sheen to it than all the rest.  I wouldn't use anything else for my client's cakes. I can also store extra fondant back into a ziplock bag and into the tub because the tub seals itself really well so it's pretty airtight.;positive
The very elite in Mac and Cheese.;positive
"I eat these at night after dinner when I get that craving but don't want to consume a lot of calories.  Each individual package has several ""cookies"" inside for around 110 calories.  I have only tried the mango coconut and cranberry and they were both delicious.";positive
Great basic starter set of bitters!;positive
I've been looking for the perfect Ginger Beer for a very long time now.  20-30 years ago I used to be able to buy a ginger beer by Schweppes, but there was limited availability back then before it disappeared altogether.  Since then, I have picked up just about any and every bottled ginger beer that I have ever seen... all very disappointing!  I hesitated buying a case of this from Amazon, assuming the worse, but was I ever surprised... this is pretty damn good stuff!  It's just a little less intense than what I remember of my beloved Schweppes ginger beer, but I'm getting on in age, and don't expect to ever find my one true love ever again... this will have to do.  It has a nice ginger bite, without making your eyeballs roll back, or your nose twist and shout.  The little (6.8oz) bottles are perfect for making a refreshing Moscow Mule, or just straight over ice.  It's not too sweet and not for kids, and will never be confused with ginger ale.  Go for it!;positive
"My roommates and I all enjoyed this very much! I was expecting it to all be candy, but that's not the case. There was a lot of of snack food such as chips and some wheat tube things (I don't know how else to describe them)  that were all very tasty. The candy was all good as well. The main thing we noticed with the candy is that the flavor was very subtle unlike our American candy, which punches you in the face with flavor. The only thing we didn't like was the 3 or 4 fish flavored things. Those were gross.

All in all it was a very fun experience and I recommend trying out!";positive
I love this brand of Matcha and I love this Matcha. It's so fine and green. I brought it as a gift to one of my clients who is a chef and she raved about it. She made croissants with this matcha on top that were amazing!;positive
Great for my sugar cookie recipe;positive
This is one great product and it is so much easier to use than chopping onions. I used to buy a large plastic jar of onion powder and it would cake so badly that I would have to cut a hole in the container and run it through  a food processor.  So far, this has not caked, which is a big plus. Also... being white onion powder, it imparts a stronger flavor.;positive
I have been gluten free for 25 years, not by choice. This is the very best pancake mix. It makes light fluffy pancakes, which if you are gluten free you know is a miracle. I try every gluten free pancake mix that I can find and I always go back to this one. I serve it to guests and they don't know it is gluten free. They are a bit more fragile than traditional pancakes.;positive
This is soooo rich and creamy. When you refrigerate it to solidify the cream, the watery part (which sinks to the bottom) is scarcely a spoonful. This means that you can use 99% of the can to make ice cream. So far this summer, we've had mocha fudge brownie ice cream, blueberry pie ice cream, and butter pecan ice cream. 100% vegan, 100% delicious. This has been a staple in my pantry for the past 3 years, and I don't see that ever changing.;positive
taste great on gram crackers;positive
I've had a Keurig for more than 5 years, actually, I'm on my fourth machine, but that's another story! These are the best dark roast K-cups available in my opinion.  I have literally tried every dark roast K-cup out there.  I like my coffee strong and this is the the strongest, most full bodied k-cup I've tried.  It also has a nice nutty flavor & isn't bitter.  You can't beat the price at .52 per cup.  Now if only Martinson would come up with a dark roast hazelnut in the same box/price, I would be delighted!;positive
I have tried a few other Rooibos loose teas and I love the flavor of this one the best. I think it has a sweeter flavor than the others I have tried. The price is great on this product as well. This bag lasts me a month and I drink tea daily. This is my main go-to tea as I love the fact it contains zero caffeine. I like the relaxing flavor it has.;positive
I can't tell the difference between carob drops and chocolate chips!  I've only used these for making healthy home-made dog treats so far, and the dogs love them!  These carob drops are great, although, I don't enjoy the price.;positive
I was so glad when M&M's came out with a dark chocolate brand - it is an addiction that only these can satisfy. Yummy and good. It definitely has a dark chocolate flavor, so if you're not into that kind of chocolate, stick to regular peanut M&M's.;positive
One of the best Belvita selections.;positive
This tastes great as a substitute for Angostura bitters in Old Fashioneds.  It's almost like the orange oil you'd get from the skin -- deep orange flavor while still being subtle and letting the bourbon take center stage.;positive
I am trying out food for backpacking trip so this caught my eye.  I brought it in to work and had it for breakfast one day.  To my surprise, it tasted really good.  When we do go on our trip, I plan to take a couple of these for breakfast.;positive
Love these raisins! Juicy and big;positive
Superb product. Puts other vanilla products in the shade. A tiny half-pinch in an entire bowl of oatmeal adds fragrance and flavor that puts gourmet foods to shame. I've used it many ways, including potpourri throughout the house. I'm glad I bought it.;positive
Our Italian son-in-law spent quite some time looking at all the EVOO offerings available on the Internet, and he selected this brand over all the others.  We agree with him that it is a good value, it has a pleasant frangrance and a nice, mild taste that make it very suitable for dressings and for cooking.;positive
Love this tea, good taste.;positive
Honestly, I'm not sure if there's any difference in these starches from brand to brand. They all seem to perform well and I haven't used any that seemed to be poor quality or lacking in any way. Given that, I buy on price and wherever I can get free shipping.;positive
Fabulous flavoring.;positive
This is the 2nd time I've ordered this product.  I like this product better than other brands I've tried, because there is less packaging/less waste.  When I make this, I use the enclosed oil and soup base packets, and I also add sriracha sauce, hoisin sauce, lime juice and fresh basil to make it taste as close to restaurant-style as possible.;positive
Taste is not  bitter.  Works perfectly in yogurt and blueberries.  Provides a satisfying crunch! Uses Criollo raw cacao beans which David Wolfe says is the best raw cacao.  I get free shipping too (with Prime though).  And on top of that it is a good price.;positive
Good along with salad and potato.;positive
This is by far, the best protein powder I've ever tasted. It genuinely tastes like cookies and creme and it's basically a milkshake that you don't need to feel bad about. It's light on protein (10g), but its a great breakfast supplement / snack. Definitely would buy this again.;positive
"So fare, I like this ghee, but it does not go with everything I make yet. I used it on toast instead of butter, but it did not taste good like butter does on toast. I tried it by making organic popcorn on the stovetop with a covered pan and it was Great! I'm still dabbling with it, but all I can say is that I'm not used to the favor yet and I don't think it goes with everything. ;)";positive
"We just started drinking coffee again after at least 10 years because news reports have been saying it's good for you.  We use to get Gavina flavored coffees because they were not overly strong and Don Francisco is the retail version of Gavina.  My husband drinks his with no sweetener but I still have to put in something to take the ""edge"" off.  We also don't use as many beans as recommended.";positive
"If you want the benefits of coconut oil (or any oil) then ideally choose an unrefined product, usually labeled as virgin or sometimes as extra virgin. Virgin oils are extracted by a mechanical method such as expeller pressing and if it's pressed under temperature-controlled conditions (not exceeding 120F) is referred to a ""cold-pressed"". As you can imagine, this is considerably better than extraction with a petrochemical solvent such as hexane. Ideally, it should also be organic, unbleached, and free of any added ingredients. The Nature's way product achieves all of these criteria. They have updated their product labels (for 32 oz and Prime Pantry versions) but switched from using the correct term ""pure virgin"" to the incorrect term ""extra virgin"" (extra virgin is specific to olive oil), and also don't state ""cold pressed"" any more (but their website does) - their marketing dept. needs to work on that.

I tried Nutiva's Refined Coconut Oil recently - they take dried coconut (copra) and extract the oil using only steam (avoiding chemicals and maintaining organic status). The main benefit from this is a 50F increase in the smoke point (to 400F) compared to unrefined coconut oil. It loses the coconut flavor in the process, which I miss, but it's more suitable for stir fries (if you like to crank up the heat) or for baking.

Cooking with the Nature's Way coconut oil is nice - it adds a slightly sweet, faintly coconutty flavor to the food but it won't dominate other flavors. Popcorn popped in the oil is especially good! The smoke point is about 25F lower than that of extra virgin olive oil so don't use super-high heat. It's also a very good moisturizer and a tiny bit goes a long way.

The Coconut Oil Miracle book is worth a read (or at least a skim; it's very repetitive) - it may be responsible for a good part of the resurgence in coconut oil sales. I think everyone would agree by now that not all fats are equal, and the medium chain saturated fatty acids in coconut oil are definitely a world apart from the longer unsaturated fats found in conventional vegetable oil. One of the most interesting aspects for me is that unsaturated fat in vegetable oil can generate free radicals when exposed to high heat during extraction (i.e. those oils not labeled as ""cold-pressed"" or ""expeller-pressed"") or high-temperature cooking or even just prolonged storage. These free radicals can cause aging and cancer. If you use regular vegetable oil (or seed oils like sunflower, canola, etc.) it's best to store it in the fridge to avoid oxidation, or at least in a cool place away from light - their shelf life is actually less than a year once opened. Because coconut oil is high in saturated fat it's actually slow to oxidize and therefore stable for longer than vegetable oils.

Sustainability: Organic coconut oil has a significantly lower environmental impact than soy or corn oil grown in the US. In the 80's the American Soybean Association tried to kill coconut oil imports, falsely suggesting that it was a leading cause of heart disease. Coconut oil has been making a comeback however - good news for Pacific nations like the Philippines where coconut farming supports a large part of the economy. Like many of the major brands, the Nature's Way oil comes in a plastic container; it's #2 plastic so it's recyclable in most areas, but that's not as sustainable as glass. Glass may be a little heavier to ship but it can be recycled over and over, while plastic has a limited lifespan and is also dirtier to manufacture. Nature's Way has nothing to say on their website about sustainability (energy use, waste, impact on communities, etc.), so either they don't do a lot on these fronts or they're just not good at marketing, or a little of both.

One of the popular alternatives to Nature's way is Nutiva, which donates 1% of sales to sustainable agriculture and has a lot more to say about their social and environmental responsibility. Just comparing the labeling on the two products, there's not a huge difference. However, Nutiva makes a good effort to support local communities, reduce waste, use renewable energy and offset the remainder by planting trees.

So, overall I'll give the Nature's Way Coconut Oil 5/5 gold stars for quality of the product and 4/5 ""green"" stars based on the social-ethical-environmental aspects of producing it. It's organically grown and manufactured by cold-pressing, plus coconut oil is more sustainable than corn or soybean oil. But it would be nice to know more about the company from a social and environmental responsibility point of view; the product would get a fifth star if it was packaged in glass and was fair trade certified or if Nature's Way provided evidence that they make a commitment to the farming communities.";positive

"This giant pack of Fun-dip was the hit of my niece's 8th birthday party. She screamed when she opened it, then handed some out and hid the rest. Then everybody got REAL hyper and you know, we had a black light and glowing paint and everything so it was actually pretty fun for an 8 year old's birthday party.

Unfortunately I only got to sample part of one pack before she hid it underneath the dirty laundry in the basket. It was good though!";positive
I love the flavor of this tea. It's perfect for gift giving and for yourself. I can relax with a cup of orange and spice tea and a couple of ginger cookies. I think it's a perfect snack or entertaining. So happy I found this tea here on Amazon. For some reason, I can't find this tea at my local stores where I used to buy this flavor.;positive
Very good and healthy.;positive
I have no complaints about the coconut milk.  Its delicious.  Unfortunately, the packing was done poorly.  I had several with the lid completely off. I don't even know how to fix it.  Also, since the packing was done poorly, all the cartons are lopsided.  Thank you for your understanding.;positive
Very cool;positive
Loves this;positive
I will never go back to conventional honey after having this. I have tried this is my green tea, on toast, biscuits, and even used it on my face. There is a distinct difference in the taste. With conventional processed honey, I have always tasted chemicals (no matter the brand), for some reason. The sweetness was false to me. With this raw honey, I know that all the benefits and good stuff is left in it, and I can definitely taste the difference. There is no honeycomb in the jar (like in some other organic raw honeys), which for me is good, because sometimes I just am not in the mood for picking it out. This honey also leaves my face much smoother and more moisturized than conventional.;positive
fresh  and sweet GF cinnamon buns with lots of decadent sweet icing and  spicy cinnamon flavor. my order arrived about  48 hours after I placed it. the product came with instructions to freeze immediately  which I did as I must ration myself on these delightful buns.  I warmed my first one up in the microwave briefly to bring out the best flavor. very happy with my experience with  Katz GF.;positive
With K-cups you buy convenience as they are more expensive than taking time to brew your own.  But you can also pay the price and not get a good product.  Not so with Twinnings Earl Grey tea....it brews a really good cuppa when I don't want to bother with a bag...which seems to be more often with all my drinks now with the Keurig.;positive

"Pretty tasty, but definitely sugary

It has no grounds however, it's entirely a powder that is completely consumed during the brewing.  Unless you go to a smaller cup size it will have a slightly watered down taste";positive
This is by far the BEST coffee I have ever tasted in my entire life. I was paying double for premium and this kicks it's butt all the way. Good price, Good beans. I highly recommend you try. Nicaraguan soil is so fertile. The best cigars and the best coffee beans hands down. I love this coffee it's so rich and tasty. I will buy this coffee every month from now on. Beats Starbucks too!;positive
I have been getting this brand for quite a while. It is consistent, and I have never had any issues with quality. I go back and forth between this and the Celtic Gray. The Gray does have a bit more flavor in my opinion.;positive
What a great way to start the day!!;positive
Chocolate was good;positive
My package arrived damaged but Amazon took care of that immediately. I enjoy these kipper snacks as they provide good protein and satisfy the fish consumption health standards now along with this type of purchase makes them affordable. I also enjoy the canned salmon just like this but haven't been able to find those on amazon, as soon as I do I will buy a case of those as well. Excellent source of good protein and at a price I can afford on my retirement income. Thank you amazon;positive
Just love these gums! I buy about 10-15 of these cute boxes a year and this is the best price. Fast delivery too. Sugarfree. They use Xylitol (good for your teeth enamel) instead of artificial sweeteners. The gum tastes very mint, it is soft and lasts long. Normally, you are not supposed to chew for more than 10 min. at a time, anyways. But who is counting?;positive
Ultimate! In Heaven! Seriously! As a crazy, mad lover of the banana taste, I wanted to avoid the sugar/carbs of a real banana and yet get that taste in my mouth and be in heaven! THIS IS IT!! I just added 1/8th tsp in my ice cream and the chocolate ice cream became fully banana with almost no hint of that chocolate taste. While that was a mistake by me, imagine how it will be in a cup of yogurt (or greek yogurt). The ideas are endless - banana chia greek yogurt pudding is my fantasy that is soon to become reality! It completely changes the taste of whatever you add it to. Get the measuring spoons and start with 1/8th of it. For some, even that can be pretty strong.;positive
"(with a small amount of lactose free milk and 3 brown sugar cubes, using the 8 ounce setting)
1. more on the strong side (in terms of caffeine kick and boldness) than most foo foo coffees.
2. reminds me of coffee with a bit of Bosco chocolate syrup (don't know why I thought of Bosco chocolate syrup)
3. more on the coffee side, than sweetness flavored side.
4. couldn't detect the macaroon (coconutty) until I really tried to detect it, and then I detected it.
5. overall a good coffee at the current price of fifteen dollars with free Prime shipping.
6. SLIGHT bitter aftertaste, but I'm stressing the slight part of what I detect.
6. overall, a VERY GOOD coffee for someone that likes to try different varieties, especially on the lighter side.
7. as of 5-17-11, I've ordered this coffee 4 times. It's quickly becoming my favorite.";positive
"I buy a lot of cashew nuts from this seller. The quality is very good - only two times from my ten purchases the bag had too many broken nuts. Cashews nuts are very beneficial - two handfuls of cashews each day may keep depression at bay because they are very rich in Tryptophan. Depressive episodes are often triggered when the body drops in serotonin and Tryptophan can boost it again. I can honestly say that this really works. Several handfuls of cashews provide 1,000-2,000 milligrams of tryptophan, which will work as well as prescription antidepressants.
The high levels of magnesium and vitamin B6 found in cashews may also help to stabilize mood. Approximately five ounces of cashews a day will provide a middle-aged man with his daily-required magnesium intake, a nutrient that, when low, can trigger mild depression. Vitamin B6 lends a hand to converting tryptophan into serotonin and helps magnesium enter into the body's cells.";positive

"The best price for chia I've seen anywhere.

Chia is a great addition to any diet - a boost in protein, fiber, and healthy fats. If you have a problem with textures, this might not be for you. If you soak it in liquid to make a pudding, it has the consistency of rice pudding or even fish eggs.  If you add it to a smoothie or oatmeal, you probably won't notice it at all - it doesn't have any taste.  The seeds are crunchy (when not soaked), I like them in a granola.";positive
I prefer the ingredients over artificial coffee 'creamers'.  Doesn't dissolve as well as you might like, though.  Best to make sure the coffee is really hot or to heat a bit after adding, it helps a big with the dissolving.;positive

"I love sweet iced tea, but don't necessarily like the glycemic load of sugar.  I've tried virtually all artificial and low/no-calorie sweeteners, and they either taste horrible or give me gastric distress.

My wife also loves iced tea, but not as sweet as I do, so we came up with a system for sweetening on demand.  As any of you iced tea aficionados out there probably know, normal granulated table sugar will not dissolve in cold tea, and it's easiest to sweeten the tea when it's hot just after brewing, but then the sweetness level is set for that batch.

So, what we do is create a simple syrup consisting of 1 part organic evaporated cane juice sugar, 3 parts of this organic raw agave syrup, and 2 parts hot water.  We put those in a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NALGENE-Tritan-1-Quart-Narrow-Mouth-BPA-Free-Water-Bottle/dp/B001NCDE52/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NALGENE Tritan 1-Quart Narrow Mouth BPA-Free Water Bottle</a>, shake it up for a minute, and voila, a very sweet liquid that we store in the fridge next to the tea.  Then, when we pour a glass of tea we splash some of the syrup in it to taste, and it mixes up nicely even in the cold tea.

And the taste of this agave sweetener is excellent.  It is not exactly like table sugar, it has a hint of a molasses or dark brown sugar flavor, but only a hint, and nothing 'artificial' or 'aftertaste'-y.

And, yes, I know this is still sugar with empty calories, but I try to use it in moderation and figure that the lower glycemic load of agave is better than full-on refined table sugar, and the fact that both ingredients are organic make me feel better about it as well.";positive
Good soup base!;positive
Good yeast;positive

I had a small box of these from the grocery store, and used them all up for iced tea making. I decided to order these since there were 100, and a reasonable price. I was quite surprised when they arrived open (individually sealed) in a box. I use these along with some Oolong, and black tea to make a very nice iced tea. They are quite strong when first opened, but it doesn't carry over to the iced tea. It really adds a nice bit of flavor.;positive

I have always used the Royal product but could not find it in the case size so I thought I would try the Jell-O brand and it is very good and very easy to make. It is very tasty and the sauce on the bottom is also very good. I hope that people will try it. I will admit that it is not what a real Mexican flan is like but this is really good.;positive

If you are trying to control the acidity in your mouth (which is why I purchased it) this is good gum. If you are chewing it for pleasure I would recommend something far less expensive with longer lasting flavor. Also, xylitol can be lethal to dogs. If you have dogs use the gum around them carefully and flush used gum. If you Google xylitol and dogs you can read all the studies.;positive

I do happen to like the stuffing part, but felt like due to the extra stuffing, the package did not include quite as many cookies as I expected.

I would purchase this if I absolutely had a taste for such a cookie, but would not make this a part of my normal grocery shopping.  It would only be for a special treat.";positive

I would recommend to others chile lover, who no longer live in the S.W.;positive
There is always a learning curve on a new product, and the next time I make a cup of the Kahlua coffee I will go with a smaller size portion to make the flavors slightly stronger. Even with the larger size, the flavor was pleasant -- I could taste the coffee, the caramel, and a strong hint of Kahlua. I use half-and-half or a flavored coffee creamer with my coffee, and for this I used half-and-half with a teaspoon of Splenda (next time I will use 1/2 teaspoon of Splenda to make it stronger). I found the strength to be about half way between mild and robust, even though the package clearly stated that it was mild. A good product!;positive
"Let me start off this review by saying I love spicy food.  If I go to an Asian restaurant, I'm the guy who asks for spicyness at a level 4/5 or 5/5.  Ok.. now that we have that taken care of:  this stuff is HOT.

How hot you ask?  If I put a toothpick into it and put it at the tip of my tongue, there is noticeable heat.  When it comes time to eat a meal, I prefer to put a drop or so into my individual portion to get really freakin noticeable heat.  The stuff is no joke.  If you use it like Frank's Red Hot, you will probably die.  100 percent recommended if you like things HOT.";positive

The flavors are good, they're fairly sweet but could be a bit sweeter.  That said, I have a MAJOR sweet tooth...my husband thinks they are plenty sweet enough.  The size is perfect for me because I RARELY drink anything but water but on the rare occasion that I want something with a bit of flavor, this is a MUCH better option than soda.  It's so hard to find anything flavored that doesn't have artificial sweetener or isn't regular soda these days so, I'll likely buy these again!;positive
very very good tea;positive
Always had good luck with 8:00 coffee.  Enjoyed this one too.  If you buy 8:00 coffee - always buy the whole bean and grind yourself.  And because Amazon wants you to say a minimum number of words I have to type this line too.;positive
soothing;positive
This is one of my favorite coffees.  I left a five star review after buying the first bag, and subsequently I've bought another five bags of it.  After every purchase, I receive an email encouraging me to leave a review.  Since I already have left a review, these emails just lead me to this form, right here, for me to edit my review.;positive
cheap good for snowed in days;positive
I was looking high and low for a good protein powder that wasn't ridiculously expensive. I took a chance on this one and not disappointed. It doesn't have that aftertaste that you often find. I love the vanilla flavor but would have preferred without the Chia seeds. They do not interfere with the blending but I am just not a fan of these seeds. Definitely good and look forward to trying some of the other flavors;positive
Actually the first time we've tried this brand.  It's thick and rich, but we do like Helman's better. This stuff is thicker and denser and Helman's has a bit more fluffy to it.  That probably means we're getting less product because air has been whipped in, but hey, we like it.  (Not taking a star off because taste is subjective);positive
"These are really yummy. Really.
I'm not dairy-free, but I wanted to share a treat with a friend who is. I didn't share all of them. The caramel and coconut milk flavors blend nicely together, and the texture is soft caramel like the artisan kinds. I think that these are going to be a part of my Christmas and/or birthday treat repertoire.";positive
"This is better than most. And the reason is that the first sugar free candies that I ever had had maltitol sugar alcohol in them That has a VERY STRONG laxative effect.

Splenda substitute does not seem to have those same laxative properties.

The chocolates taste about something like you could expect to find at Walmart/ Walgreens. Not the highest quality, ,but edible.

Verdict: If you have a diabetic/ insulin resistant family member, these are worth the price.";positive
"I've only recently got into this sardine thing. There's a lot of reasons to eat them-- less mercury, sustainable fishing, inexpensive, (and especially the type with skins and bones) really good for you....but I'm really squeamish about such things (boney fishy heads and tails in mystery liquid, to eat!? *shiver*).

These sardines though, are sardines for the squeamish. Skinless, boneless, identifiable fillets that are mild, meaty, and pretty easy to eat. If you like tuna then you should like these. The kind in oil are probably better but I bought these in water to save a few calories.";positive
As someone who watches what he eats, I normally avoid chips.  However, these chips have a lot of protein and less carbs and fat than regular chips.  They also taste great.  The Cinnamon Sugar is my new mid morning snack.;positive
These are good, but the turmeric ones are even better. Would love to be able to order in bulk off amazon. To get best flavor toast them over an open burner on lowest possible flame like you would with a flour tortilla. Flip over when it starts to bubble.;positive
"The most recent update:
they sent the USDA organic document and I could make sure it's USDA organic. These beans are great to self-roast. I really like them. I suspected it might not be USDA organic since I couldn't see the company's name on the USDA integrity database but they sent me the document certified as USDA organic with different company name (I guess the buyer is importer while the certified company is another company in Indonesia) Anyway, I highly recommend these beans.

Update: it's not USDA organic

Pretty good! I self roast with a popcorn popper and these beans are beautifully roasted and taste great :)

I like these beans but recently I found the company is not listed on USDA organic integrity list. [...]
For example, the dandelion root tea I usually buy from Amazon (https://www.amazon.com/Starwest-Botanicals-Organic-Dandelion-Sifted/dp/B003AYEHGQ/ref=sr_1_7_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1470084605&sr=8-7&keywords=organic+dandelion+root+tea) is listed on the database specifically with its brand name and product name.
Using USDA organic labeling without certification is illegal. The only reason I chose this product was I thought it was organic.

I asked the company and they said they are USDA organic certified and they could provide the paper. But when I requested the paper, they don't answer at all.";positive
Excellent for chai.;positive

I bought a 6 package of this hamburger helper. I use it with or without meat. Great either way. If used without meat , its like a super cheesy noodles of goodness, great for little ones. Great flavor and worth the value.;positive
My husband gave up coffee and drinks this daily.  It's 3 times the price at the local healthfood store.  Wish it was subscribe and save.  My husband doesn't tell my he is out until he is totally out.  Luckily it arrives 2 days after ordered.;positive

"My husband and I love French Roast coffee, and we always use the whole bean for a wonderful, aromatic cup of fresh, hot coffee. We have been using a coffee club for years, and we decided to try some other brands, so we tried Neville's coffee. The price was fair for the amount of beans in the package. Most coffees are only 10 ounces, now, so it was nice to get one+ pounds of coffee. The coffee tasted fresh, and had just the dark French roast that we like.

We plan to use Neville's coffee on a regular basis now. I hope others enjoy it as much as we do.";positive
I love the flavor of this syrup.  It has a smooth dark chocolate taste.  It works great for mochas (hot or cold).  It's a pretty thin liquid, though, and I noticed it goes a lot faster than the Ghirardelli syrup I was using previously.  It has a better taste, though.;positive
yea;positive
I purchased this set about 2 months ago and have used it virtually every day since. It makes brewing loose tea very easy with minimal cleanup of the tea leaves. And I just am very happy with the look and feel of the mug. It would make a great gift.;positive
"Mostly we eat tuna in salad or heated in casserole type dishes, so the flavor is not as critical to us as it would be to some people who eat their tuna almost plain from the can.  However, when combined with chopped sweet onion, celery, olive oil and fresh lemon juice, this tuna is very tasty.

I am willing to pay extra for this tuna mostly because of the BPA free can although the quality doesn't seem to me to be higher than other premium ""health"" brands such as Natural Sea. I have also purchased the Wild Planet brand of albacore tuna and personally prefer the taste and texture of this skipjack tuna - even though it is, as others have mentioned, quite salty tasting.";positive
YUM!! Love that it is raw!!;positive
Great mix.;positive
These snacks may not be the healthiest but they are sure tasty. The slim Jim has always been a quick fatty protein snack on the go. I like the combination of spices they use. I believe it lends to the filling attribute of these snacks. It is a great value in this package and would be something great to bring to work and put in your desk or locker for a quick snack.;positive
They taste good.  We had a little gapping at the fountain but did not burp the fountain as instructed.  (we had a third party running the fountain for us while we hostessed).  I assume that was the problem.  We were otherwise happy with them.  I haven't tried it but I have heard you can use cheaper chocolate with more-than-satisfactory results.;positive
I was looking for something to help with digestive enzymes and to improve on the flora in my gut and was pleasantly surprised about the taste of this! Not bad, tastes clean and like vinegar mostly. Use it just like any other sauerkraut only it's medicine!! :) Really good product! Also, it's a small jar but they really pack it in there, lasted a long time.;positive
What a lovely tray!  Just as pictured and on a nice study tray.  Sent this as a Thank you.  The shipping was super fast and was delivered in perfect condition.  Will definitely order this high quality product again!;positive
I have had TVP in the past and while I was ok with it, they had a lot of allergens like gluten and lots of perservatives in it.  This product only has soy in it.  It is very easy to cook with and tastes great.;positive
I love Bob's Red Mill sweet rice flour. We make the BEST gluten free pancakes with it. When we use the regular white rice flour, it has to soak for an hour. With the sweet rice flour, we have pancakes in no time. Just mix, cook, and enjoy.;positive
I bought this for the smell. I plan to use it Spritz it on my dog so she smells like orange blossoms. If you smell it straight out of the bottle, it smells very bitter, but if you get a quick whiff of it, it smells exactly like orange blossoms.;positive
Good for cooking and toping.;positive
Great for breakfast.;positive
The yummiest !!!!;positive
"We all know this stuff is evil. Diet or regular, colas are a poor choice health wise.

But we love our Coke, and have for generations!

While these are more expensive than other sizes, they are a real help when you're trying to wean off the stuff or just cut down. Also good so that you have a variety to offer guests but do not want to store cases of full size cans.";positive
"For providing great coffee at a great price.  I'm starting a business and have little extra cash. I work 70+ hours a week, and like to stay well caffeinated.  This coffee tastes great, and I can afford to have this really good coffee and drink as much of it as I want. $5-6 a pound, and the Starbucks is $10 for 14 oz?
No way.  Not for me. I've made some sales, and can't wait to try some of their more high falutin offerings.

Keep it up!!
The YD";positive
We are liking this stuff.  It has mild carob flavor but in my book that's a good thing.  A lot of carob nibbles and dark carob powder we've tasted are bitter and unpleasant.  I don't think any of the carob we've tried really tastes like chocolate.  We use this in coconut cream based ice cream and it gives it texture and takes the edge off the coconut flavor.  It's almost like a vanilla flavor.  It certainly has a different taste than the dark bitter stuff if you are looking for something a bit different.;positive
What a difference between these jumbo seeds and the regular ones. I am a lifelong sunflower seed connoisseur. I have a few bags of the regular seeds in the cupboard which I barely touch. However the jumbo seeds I can't leave alone. Well worth getting. Five stars.;positive
My favorite taco seasoning.;positive
Used this for spiced cakes and  frosting, along with nutmeg and such - tasted great.  I haven't been able to find this in a large jar/package unless it came in a barrel!  Glad I could find it in a small enough and more practical size.  Shipping was great, nothing was warped or damaged.;positive
Loved it as a child and still do!;positive
I didn't know what to expect when I ordered. I just ordered a Chemex style coffee maker and want good coffee. This coffee fits the bill. It is great tasting. I have been drinking coffee for 50 years and this is the best coffee I have had. It is smooth and strong tasting but has a woody taste. My new coffee maker has something to do with it too. This coffee was shipped fast and it sealed tightly in a bag. I am very satisfied.;positive
Good product, good price;positive
This granola is the best.  The flavor is amazing and has just the right amount of sweetness.  Most granolas on the market are full of additives and sugar.  I love that there are only a handful of ingredients in this granola and really.. it tastes great!;positive
I purchased a box of these to pass out as stocking stuffers to my siblings. We all grew up in England, and the ice cream man there used to stick these in the vanilla ice cream cones. My only problem with this order was that there was a bunch of Arabic writing on the packaging, which made me feel as if these were made and packaged for somewhere in the Middle East, but they tasted the same as I remember, and nobody seemed to question the Arabic writing all over the candy wrappers.;positive
I bought these to keep in my desk drawer at work in case myself or one of my employees has an upset stomach. I usually wasn't sure if they would work, but not only does it help with upset stomachs, they taste wonderful!;positive
Deliciously smooth and rich cacao powder. This stuff has become a staple in our kitchen.  We transfer the cacao powder to a canister with a scoop and use it to turn our morning coffee into chocolatey mochas and sometimes after dinner we use it to make a nice hot cup of cocoa.  Just add a couple teaspoons to a mug of hot water, add sweetener of choice, and enjoy!  Viva Labs uses organic Criollo cacao beans which make for a less bitter cacao powder than others.  It's USDA Organic certified and QAI Organic Certified, so you get the full natural antioxidant benefits and the beans are not roasted so there are no 'carcinogenic' worries either.  I will definitely purchase again, as I really love this stuff and the pricing is fair.;positive
You cannot beat Kellogg's for quality and if you can find this item at a price that beats the prices at your local store, buy this! It arrived quickly, thanks to Amazon Prime, and tastes delicious. It is very fresh...the raisins are soft and not hard as rocks that you can get when you inadvertently buy a stale box. That's not been an issue with Amazon.;positive
"My son in college loves these and I send them to him through subscribe and save in a little monthly ""care package."" He appreciates the variety of flavors and likes the texture. I love that they seem to be healthy and that he actually eats them.";positive
"I can't understand why ALL K-Cups haven't been redesigned to work like these San Francisco Bay products. Honestly, I feel too guilty about the environmental impact of the traditional plastic cups to allow myself to use them. (I read that the inventor of the K-cup now regrets he developed them because of the devastating impact of all that extra plastic in our landfills.) These cups are all bio-degradable, and is a much more responsible choice for Keurig owners. (The price is also very reasonable, and the delivery by Amazon very prompt and reliable.)

Regarding the strength and flavor of this particular version (Fog Chaser), I think it's fine and have been very satisfied with it. (And I tend to like a pretty strong coffee flavor.) However, several other user reviewers have not liked it. I would urge anyone who isn't crazy about this particular flavor to try another San Francisco Bay version....they make a number of them and I'm confident you can find one more to your liking. It's certainly worth trying others in order to settle on one that you like and allowing you to be a more responsible steward of the earth at the same time.";positive
"If I could give it ten stars I would! I have bought coffee from all over the world, including Blue Mountain coffee; from every seller and subscription service in search of the perfect coffee and this is IT. It is not acrid, bitter, nor does it have an after taste. It is smooth and tastes wonderful! The customer service is excellent as well. You cannot go wrong with this coffee! It is medium roast and does not muck up my percolator. I've decided that this is is the only coffee I'm buying from now on. Its perfect. I know when I serve coffee that this is will be the best. I can drink it all day and not feel jittery, it doesn't upset your stomach or your bowels, just smooth and great tasting coffee the way coffee should be.";positive
"Excellent tasting Nigella seeds. They are fragrant and delicious. Try throwing them in a yogurt dip or in some roasted chickpeas. Amazing! I am going to try to plant some soon. Read up on the benefits of these little black seeds!

Note: The packaging did not have any chemical smell or anything negative about it as well.";positive
I'm always on the search for dates in grocery stores including whole foods stores and can never seem to find anything but really dried out, God-knows-how-old and tasteless dates. But these United With Earth Medjool Dates are FANTASTIC...soft, sweet large, easy to pit and delicious. I can't say enough good things about them. They shipped quickly. I had them in only a few days. Admittedly they're a little pricy but not when you compare to tasteless grocery store offerings and when you consider the high quality of this delicious fruit. Highly recommend.;positive
"I buy a lot of cashews but first time from this company. These cashews are of excellent quality!
Cashews nuts are very beneficial - two handfuls of cashews each day may keep depression at bay because they are very rich in Tryptophan. Depressive episodes are often triggered when the body drops in serotonin and Tryptophan can boost it again. I can honestly say that this really works. Several handfuls of cashews provide 1,000-2,000 milligrams of tryptophan, which will work as well as prescription antidepressants.
The high levels of magnesium and vitamin B6 found in cashews may also help to stabilize mood. Approximately five ounces of cashews a day will provide a middle-aged man with his daily-required magnesium intake, a nutrient that, when low, can trigger mild depression. Vitamin B6 lends a hand to converting tryptophan into serotonin and helps magnesium enter into the body's cells.
I would definitely recommend these cashews!";positive
"Changed over to this from an auto delivery order of Bigelow Darjeeling after trying the first cup of Bigelow--which tasted like I'd imagine swill would. My husband described it as 'sawdust in water'. Was very happy with my purchase of Twinings Darjeeling. Not only was the taste WAY better, but I got more than twice the tea at just another 11.00. I'm paying 9 cents a tea bag for Twinings vs the 13 cents a bag I paid for Bigelow's barf bags. Don't bother with Bigelow: just go straight for the Twinings. If my husband, who will eat anything, hated this tea and wouldn't drink it, I think that about says it all.

No, this is not as good as loose tea, but it's absolutely lovely for your daily cuppa, as it is light and doesn't leave a strong after taste. Good value.";positive
This is now a pantry staple for me, I add two tablespoons of peanut butter to my protein bars or use it in baking or any other way you would typically use regular peanut butter..  I love it, it's quick and easy to use just put two heaping teaspoons of powder in a small dish with a little bit of water and mix it up and wala... you have peanut butter!  I missed peanut butter, but since losing weight I could not afford the fat, calories & sugar in regular peanut butter, this is such a treat!;positive
Excellent.  I recently, after over ten yrs of kcups, decided I am tired of paying 50c apiece for coffee.  I can get the finest Jamaican Blue for that price if I grind my own!  Bought refillable snap shut pods here on Amazon and read reviews and went with a cheap Krups grinder and Wild Jo French Roast and I will never buy a kcup again.  I think we all got very deluded by keurig for a long time.  This is super easy, more tasty, and much much more practical as well as environmentally healthy.;positive
Fast shipping and great tea!;positive
These are SO good.  I love that they are organic and that I can use exactly the amount that I want and don't have to rely on canned beans. I think that these have so much more flavor and I can control how soft or firm they are. Great for everyday use.;positive
Arrived on time an in tact.;positive
Wife loves it.;positive
Great Price and They Were FRESH;positive
This gum is excellent. It loses its flavor about 5-7 minutes of chewing, but I usually keep chewing it longer than that, just as something to keep my jaw occupied while I work, exercise, etc. It's great for that. I like that it has dentist-recommended benefits as well. My teeth feel very nice and clean after I chew on one of these post-mealtime.;positive
I love this. When I was a kid, my mom couldn't cook very well at ALL and she used this on almost everything because it makes everything taste good! Now, I've grown and I can cook and I still use this in a lot of things. Baked Chicken, Potatoes, Pasta... you can use this on SO many things!;positive
ketchup is my favorite condiment;positive
"""Fog Chaser""...a great description! Extremely fresh. The taste is surprisingly deep and rich for a medium roast, or ""Full City."" I usually drink a darker roast just to get the extra bit of flavor, but this one is even better than San Francisco Bay's French Roast. The only other coffees that come close are&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brooklyn-Bean-Roastery-Fuhgeddaboudit/dp/B006Q822L0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brooklyn Bean Roastery ""Fuhgeddaboudit""</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cyclone/dp/B006Q82652/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Cyclone,""</a>&nbsp;two of my other favorites, along with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Green-Mountain-Revv/dp/B006N3I5DM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Green Mountain Revv</a>.

Keep in mind that these are ""pods"" rather than actual k-cups, so after you open the bag, you will need to seal the unused capsules in a zip bag, preferably in the refrigerator (not the freezer). Doing this, I've never had the coffee go stale. If you like deep, flavorful coffee, I recommend you give this one a try.";positive

Good baking soda. Recommended.;positive
I've only used this for curry. Just make sure it is sufficiently mixed if it has been stored in the refrigerator for a few days. It tends to settle but the flavor comes back after mixing. Suggest to take out of fridge and warm to room temp then stir before using.;positive

I like these candies but I don't love them.  i am partial to the original flavors.  I think the flavors are interesting and don't hate any of them.  They help with the sweet tooth without adding too many calories.  The arrived in good condition in a nice container.  I put them in my covered candy dish.  Happy I tried them.  Will probably look for the old fashion ones next time.;positive

"Found this variety at the supermarket while looking over what was on sale.  After reading the label, I went with these instead.  White tuna in water with no added salt means you get just the fish with no added salt, fat, or anything else.  Even with some light mayonnaise, there's not a heavy salt presence, and it doesn't taste like you're eating over-processed tuna.  Interestingly, the can is ""upside down"" compared to others - even other Bumble Bee varieties - in that the side you would open is the ""bottom"" and not the top (or you can say the label is on upside down).  After eating the cans I bought at the store, I came here and bought a case for the pantry - I like to keep a stock of ""power failure"" food, and this will certainly fit the bill.";positive
Yummy and healthy, great snack!;positive
"I do hope the red velvet craze dies away some day but it probably will not until we have had to suffer through red velvet toothpaste, red velvet laundry detergent and red velvet tires. This is a tasty cookie and I recommend it but  I did not ""taste"" any red velvet-ness; hence my only four star rating.";positive
Great. Thank you;positive
I love these chips. I've had diabetes for over 20 years and after many years of not taking proper care of myself, I'm finally well controlled.  I've done that with a high fiber, low glycemic diet which brought my blood sugars to a more healthy level.  These chips fit right into that diet plan as long as I eat a handful at a time only.  It keeps me satisfied and I don't feel deprived.  There is a good variety of different bean flavors but pintos are my personal favorites so I pretty much stick with them.  They stay nice and crunchy and fresh tasting.  They have just enough salt and are just damn good.  But  they can be addictive so it's important for diabetics to remember portion control and moderation. The first ingredient listed is whole beans which is important in keeping this chip healthier than the others.;positive
"Super yummy treat! If you like the flavor of sesame, you'll likely love these!! The flavor cuts through... in a subtle but delicious way! Bits of mango, strawberry, and almonds bring loads of flavor, making them sweet but not too sweet. Very, very crunchy!

At first bite, I thought these tasted a bit like rice cakes but quickly changed my mind... Not quite as light or airy and much more fulfilling (although I do like some rice cakes lol, these are better).

Originally ordered these as I was seeking foods with some pure mango, good for thyroid... Glad we found these! Less than 10 ingredients and we can pronounce them all, haha.. Wa-hoo! 100% natural, gluten free, the list goes on... Bottom line: DEE~LISH!! Smile.

I posted some photos, lol. Hope this is helpful!";positive
I purchased these gummy bears for a neighbor's son that serves as caregiver for our dog when we travel.  He was pleasantly surprised and elated when he found the huge bag waiting for him when we recently left him in charge of our pooch AND the gummy bears!  He announced that they are delicious, and he planned to 'do away' with them quickly!  While I had to sample them prior to giving them to him, I'll have to admit, they are delicious!  AND a great price!;positive
Awesome deal! Each bar is 'multi-pack size' (slightly smaller than individual bars at 32g, but at about fifty cents a bar this is a tasty steal. Arrived well packaged and ahead of schedule, the honeycomb goodness covered in milk chocolate was well worth the asking price. Would buy again and recommend it to others.;positive
The aroma that comes from the coffee pot with this bean freshly ground starts my day perfectly! Have made my morning ritual to start the coffee & do my exercises, the aroma gives me the motivation to complete the routine to get to my coffee!;positive
not bad, using it;positive
too expensive..;positive
These were absolute perfection for making homemade vanilla. I used all 10 in a one-quart mason jar and filled with vodka. It took no time at all for the extra to turn nice and dark, but of course the flavor develops over time, so I'm still letting it steep and shaking a bit for a couple more weeks.;positive
Would definitely buy again!;positive
"Great Pork Seasoning!
I use with ground Pork to make my White Country Sausage Gravy!
My husband Loves it!
I just added some to the scrambles pork as it was frying!

I Purchased the 6 pack which really reduced the unit price.";positive
Good, we plan to sprout it.;positive
In the past I've always purchased this coffee in our local stores. But after coming across it here I'll be buying it here as long as the price remains competitive here. This is a delicious flavor that I really enjoy! Give it a try, hope you enjoy it too!;positive
They have good fruit flavor!;positive
"This is amazing stuff - incredibly aromatic. I've been using it sparingly over the past few months for making orgeat syrup - the almond-based syrup used in Mai Tais. This adds an incredible subtle flavor if used in small amounts (can be overdone!) that makes for the best Mai Tai. With the twist cap tightly in place in the fridge, it has lasted 3 months so far with absolutely no deterioration in aroma or flavor.

Highly recommended!";positive
My new favorite snack! Wish the prices were better ---- I would definitely buy more, but the price is prohibitive. Cinnamon flavor is great, and even the salt and pepper --- YUM! Great on-the-go snack. But priced too high, which is my only reason for four-star instead of 5. Search for these at the best possible price and you'll be glad you found them.;positive
"This is still the best hot chocolate mix I've found. Winter is the time for drinking hot chocolate and around my area they just don't carry this brand anymore. The other brand is too watery and just doesn't have as rich a taste as Nestle. We're on our third box already and continue to enjoy it everyday. And reordering with Amazon is pretty simple... I just go to my previous orders and Amazon has a ""reorder"" button right on the Nestle's page.";positive
Tasty and real.;positive
"Great Stuff, & Great Customer Service From Supply Tiger!  I Use it on an Eye of Chuck Steak (Poor Dudes Rib-Eye) if U Can Find it @ Your Local Grocery Store, it Has All The Flavor of a Rib-Eye Just Not as Fatty & at Aboot a 1/3 of The Price!  If U Really Want to Get Technical U Can Dig Through The Chuck Steak Section & Hoard All of The Chuck Steaks That Have a White Blade Bone.  (This is Where The Prime Rib Section of The Front 1/4 of Beef, is Separated From The Tougher Chuck Section)  Probably Too Much Info LOL, But O Well...I Routinely Use 3/4 cup of Water Instead of 2/3 it Seems to Cut The Saltiness, But U Need to Marinate a Little Longer to Compensate!  If U Want a BBQ Cowboy Steak Flavor, Add a Little ""Famous Daves""  Rich & Sassy to The Marinade & Mix it in, (Preferably Towards The End of The Marinade Time-15min.)  Be Warned It Does Tend to Make a Mess of The Grill, so i Would Say Invite The In-Laws Over That Way if The ""Awkward Tense Silence"" is Inevitable, Put em to Work Cleaning The Grill  :-)P...";positive
good tea.;positive
I do enjoy the bubble gum flavor and the kick of caffiene, I also like the fact that it comes from Scotland which is one of the few places where the drink outsells Coca Cola.  Glad it is sold on Amazon at a decent price as one of the large grocery chains here is slow to restock it.;positive
I absolutely love this stuff!  I drink it after every run and often times in my camel back on a long trail run. It has 300 mg of Potassium and 19 grams of Total Carbohydrates.  It is gluten free and caffeine free.  It has no artificial colors and is made of 10% coconut water.  Also I am proud to say it is free of high fructose corn syrup!  If you read the label none of the ingredients are strange or unusual.  My favorites are the Orange Mango and the Tropical Punch.;positive
IF YOU CAN AFFORD THIS PRODUCT THAN YOU SHOULD ORDER IT ALL THE TIME. IT HAS A UNIQUE TASTE THAT OTHERS CAN'T DUPLICATE. I WOULD GET IT MONTHLY BUT I FOUND OTHER PRODUCTS ON AMAZON ALMOST AS GOOD AND COSTS MUCH LESS. BUT, THIS IS THE ROLLS ROYCE OF MALT SO YOU HAVE TO PAY TO GET THE BEST.;positive
I got hooked on the real thing, but the quality of the coconuts were not real consistent, and it's so much work to get the milk out. This stuff is great! Tasty, refreshing and convenient. It always seems to perk me up in the afternoon when I've been working hard.;positive
Moist and great tasting;positive
Ok, but I have had better.....;positive
My favorite keurig drink ever!;positive
Had a chance to try this at a friend's house when their power went out on the weekend. Very good. Tasty and easy to make. I'm so glad I purchased a can. Living in Tornado alley, one never knows when this may come in handy.;positive
"***I added two pictures of what this tea looks dry- total of two tablespoons - and after brewing for 5 minutes!
I made a huge pot, and my large strainer was BULGING over. In fact I had to remove some tea after a minute to let this tea steep! This is why I always mention this tea expands 10 times it's size, and not to use a ball infuser, EVEN with a tsp. making one cup! If the tea looks like tiny hard 'sticks, leaves'... they bloom into huge fresh leaves of goodness. **As a side note, I will never use this large amount when making the tea again- not all of the leaves opened to their full potential-also I put all my left over Immortalitea soaked leaves in my garden- you should see my climbing roses!
***UPDATE**** March 12,2016
*As I said in my first review I did not buy this for 'slimming or losing weight'- I bought it for all it's health benefits.
*After drinking regularly I started noticing that my appetite seemed to be less. I was drinking everyday around 11 am. and it curbed my appetite- in a good way- with no jitters or blood sugar drops.
*I looked up other so called diet teas and started reading ingredients. As we know this Integra fromThe Immortalitea Company is four teas, nothing else is added.
*Other teas I researched contained SENNA, which is a natural laxative, and other ingredients for water loss, plus ingredients listed as 'flavoring'-what flavors?.
*If you know about these four different teas they may do these things- naturally. Tulsi is a tea used for stomach problems and can help as a laxative- this is from researching on google (: PLUS this Tulsi is green Tulsi, NOT basil, but Green Tulsi from Thailand, from a small Thai tea farmer.
*As I state with ALL of my Integra teas, do not use a ball tea strainer, use a strainer that allows these teas to grow- because they will- at almost 10 times their size! THAT is some fresh tea!
*I went to the Doctors on February 9, they weighed me-my scale is accurate to theirs- and weighing myself today, I am four pounds less. Do I credit this tea? Yes! BUT I drink it on a regular basis, and I have always watched what I eat. I can not exercise daily or even weekly at times, and I am doing nothing different.
* Before buying a diet tea, research what you are going to be drinking first.
*ASK Immortalitea Tea Company questions, if you have any, as they will answer them.
*I DID NOT get this free (;.. I wanted to share what this tea has done for me, and how great my experience has been, and my experience will not be your experience.
*A few hints- do not expect miracles, drink at the same time everyday-if possible, I drink two 12 ounce mugs daily, eat healthy  and get some sort of exercise.
*I am so grateful for companies such as Immortalitea, they are far and few between, and when we find them- we should support them!

The reason I bought THIS tea was not just for slimming but it had all four of the teas I love to drink- Jiaogalan, White Mulberry, Oolong and Tulsi -in one. The health benefits are incredible.
It taste much like Jiaogulan but has a floral nose. When I sip this tea it is very dimensional. I can taste the different teas AND just like my white mulberry tea and all of Immortalitea's tea- it is so fresh- the leaves and tea buds quadruple in size!- so plan on using a large steeper, or open tea pot - but definitely not a tea ball- this tea needs room to bloom (;
I have purchased four teas and white mulberry snacks from Immortalitea and every single product has been some of the freshest tea I have enjoyed, and I LOVE to drink tea. I look forward to drinking this Integra Tea for my health and because it taste delicious. Hey if I lose those 10 pounds in the meanwhile- bonus!";positive
We brew this coffee in our coffee maker when we saw it was available in K cups we tried it in our keurig. It's just as good in the K cup as it is when being brewed I would recommend this item to family & friends;positive
I love this cereal.  It has good crunch and blueberry flavor.  However, I have sampled a few Kashi's and have a strong preference for their crunchy cereals that are like rice puffs.  This cereal is flakes.  So I mix the flakes with the crunchy puffs!  Pretty good.;positive
Fantastically delicious, fresh, and full of sriracha flavour.  Very portable and perfect for backpacking, these bars fill you up without the heavy feeling of whey or soy from traditional protein bars.  I definitely will purchase this product again, especially in the convenient value multi-pack.;positive
So. Good.;positive
"nice flavor, but a little too salty for my tastes, so I save them for a special treat.  I love the texture and flavor of wheat thins, just with I'd thought to check the sodium before I bought them.  I'm sensitive to sodium; I'm sure many folks wouldn't notice.";positive
Perfect little packages for home or on the go. This product shouldn't require any introduction, we all remember the greatness of these Sugar Wafers. Easy to tuck into a lunch, purse or a carry on. Always a fresh package as needed. Looking forward to purchasing these again.;positive
Great flavor,;positive
Most delicious and juicy turkey I have cooked in a while. Everything was super easy and the only problem was lifting that big turkey! This is the best way to brine a turkey, seriously.  I will be doing this again in the future.;positive
this were pretty good;positive
Love - love - love this gum!!;positive
I'm on my second bag of this great product.  My breads were coming out just fine without it.  However, adding 2 heaping tablespoons of this enhancer does make a difference.  I plan to continue using it. I started making yeast dough about 42 years ago. I have never used a bread machine but I do use the kneading hook on our KitchenAid or Hobart N-50 mixers.  I just ordered a bag of wheat gluten to see if it improves my rye bread outcome.  I've noticed that my rye bread, although very light and tasty, is a bit crumbley.  From what I've read, the problem seems to be related to gluten content.  I use King Arthur medium rye flour with bread flour and am looking forward to seeing what the extra gluten does.;positive
"What more can a person ask for when they have a good cuppa in their hand?
The boxes may be huge and the subscription of getting two big boxes of tea might sound like you are ready to open a tea room but it isn't.  The tea is fresh so it will last a fair amount of time and the price is the best I have found short of walking into an ASDA in the UK!  480 Tea bags is not that much when you do the math.  One in the morning, another around lunch, and another in the afternoon, three bags a day (so far). Then a friend pops by and there goes two bags, if they stay a while another or two, lets count two bags once a week for friends.  That makes 21 for the regular week, add two more you have 23. One box lasts 10 weeks, and if you have friends over after church the extra 10 goes quick. So this is only 20 weeks of tea, and it is still fresh and before the best by date!
I am retired Military and can shop on base.  The tea on base is not as fresh as these, and the price is more also.
Again, I ask, What more can a person ask for when they have a good cuppa in their hand?";positive
Got a great deal on this one with the coupon and subscription...only a few dollars more than the 2lbs jar.  This is a great flavor and works well in my smoothies to give me a protein boost in the mornings.  Of course, I seem to favor vanilla as chocolate just seem to be captured in protein powders or shakes to my liking;positive
Fresh and good! Fast delivery.;positive
I know this is really really good for me. I put it in my smoothies, but the grit is still there. My machine doesn't grind it all up. Maybe if I put it in my little food processor first, it might be a lot better. I love the idea of getting my Omega's this way!;positive
Not bad when you need something in a hurry. These bars have helped me after bariatric surgery, and they weren't as disgusting as some of the others. This item is a lower priced alternative to some of the more expensive, and more nauseating bars.;positive
This is a terrific hot cereal. The instructions tell you to use 1/4 cup cereal mixed with 3/4 cup water and microwave for 3-5 minutes on high. But I got creative -- 1/4 cup cereal, 1/3 cup All Whites (liquid egg whites = to 2 egg whites), and 8 oz. non-fat milk well stirred together and it was cooked to a nice slight crunch in 3 minutes. Then a small splash of maple syrup and I had the tastiest low cal breakfast imaginable. And I only had a mug and an orange juice glass to wash.;positive
I was super hungry and I ate two of these packages with pasta sauce.  Typically I could eat a whole box of regular angel hair pasta in one sitting, but just eating two packs of these I am super stuffed.  Yes, I do have abnormally large apetite.  Best part is that there are no additional calories or carbs.;positive
"2 out of 3 people liked the lamb bar very much; the 1 person thought it was too bland but otherwise acceptable while the other 2 thought highly of the taste and texture. I have tried the beef, bison and turkey and enjoyed them while hiking in Yosemite. The spicy flavor is balanced well enough to be enjoyable. Texture is a bit too lacking in grain structure though making mouth-feel a bit like doughy after chewing.";positive
"Low sugar count, and high chocolate flavor!
Though meant as a topping on tiramisu or coffe with whipcream, you can use this product to make or improve your own  chocolate milk.
Tired of all the excessive sugars in drinks and foods?
Tired of the bland and sugary tasting liquid you buy in the stores, called ""chocolate milk""?
Add this for extra chocolate flavor and bite, or create your own ""dark chocolate milk"" from regular, or almond milk.

It mixes with cold (15 min) or hot (1min) milk.
Great to also improve on flavor of protein drinks, by just adding it to the protein powder in your shake, or just add 50/50 to your overly sweet nesquick powder, and save your children from growing up becoming borderline obese from what our society puts in the racks of our supermarket!";positive
Excellent. Highly recommend it.;positive
Amazing for kombucha;positive
Good quality.  Qill buy again.;positive
I am a new user of this product and I really like it. I don't taste any flavor and its really easy to use out of the container. easy to scoop and easy to store.  I have tried it in cookies and used it as cooking oil for meats and veggies and all works well.  Since I am not heavy user of shortening the 24 OZ container is lasting me longer than expected. However, I am learning how to use this item as high temperature cooking oil to replace my usual veg oil. No complaints and the foods I have cooked with came out great.;positive
I ordered this for my mother in law who is in LOVE with Elvis. At some point you run out of Elvis crap to buy and have to think outside of the box. I found a coffee mug with Elvis and then this coffee popped up. I'm sure that this will never be opened but added to her shelf of dust catchers but it will brighten her day. So thanks to whom ever thought of this. I was out of ideas for this woman.;positive
My package just arrived in excellent condition and I just had my first piece of this bread. It was excellent and very satisfying. The loaf of bread is heavy and dense when I picked it up. 1 slice is very filling and satisfying. It tastes like homemade bread and almost like, I said almost like, not like a piece of cake but not sweet. The bread was moist and delicious and had a nice consistency. It is not crumbly at all, it stayed completely whole and did not crumble at all when I ate it. It was moist and excellent. I have never had this type of Paleo bread before, I am so glad I ordered 2 loaves!!! I put 1 in the fridge and 1 in the freezer. I felt like I needed some bread or carbs today due to a workout and this hit the target perfectly because I don't eat any grains anymore, this was a great low carb healthy option. I loved it. This bread is fantastic. In another review I read someone stated that this bread was oily or greasy, nothing could be further from the truth, I don't know why anyone would give this bread a negative review it is so delicious and satisfying for those of us that love carbs but are not eating grains. I will continue to buy this over and over again, this bread is a homerun.;positive
Pretty good price;positive
I wait until Amazon has a sale on this as its pricey but, for those that enjoy a robust cup of great tasting coffee the Green Mountain Dark Magic and Double Black Diamond are two great ones.  When buying this stuff, always make sure you get the Amazon Prime Logo by the item you are buying.  This way you can count on satisfaction.;positive
This tea, Imperial Earl Grey, is so delicious. The leaves are really nice they don't go through my tea basket and the fresh bergamot flavor is really good. Really happy with all the teas I have received from VAHDAM. Seems to be a good company and I will be ordering again.;positive
The kids LOVE these!;positive
I just want to ease some fears on this item. Mine just arrived, no broken shells, no melted one, and double bagged for safety and freshness. AND this beats the heck out of paying a buck and a quarter for a vending machine bag. It's one of my few guilty pleasures and now about thirty cents a day as opposed to 1.25;positive
The price is terrific but the rice cakes are always just a bit less crisp then I fee they should be. I don't know if it's the packaging but they are not the usual crisp texture I buy in the store. But at less than half the price, I'll put them in the toaster oven for 30 seconds.;positive
"Not much to say here.  The barley is as advertised.  The shipping was slower than I expected, especially since the state of origin isn't all that far from my home, but the price was better than I could find anywhere else.

This is hulled barley, which has the bran intact, unlike pearl barley.  It takes longer to cook, but it also keeps better and that is what I want in a grain.  Also, of course, having the bran intact means having the bran to eat, which is more fiber in our diets.  I have cooked this whole in a stew, and it was the same as pearl barley in appearance.  I cracked it in a Corona mill and it then cooked up like rice in a soup.

When we poured it into the storage bucket, the grain appeared clean.  There was no dirt or foreign plant material.";positive
These are incredibly good cookies;positive
It just tastes like heaven!!!;positive
We love this tea.  We've been drinking it for decades!  It's so convenient to have it delivered in 6-packs on a regular basis, and we save a little money this way, too.  I like mine with milk and sweetener (I use Truvia);positive
Love this for traveling!;positive
Amazing price!;positive
I love this junk.;positive
GREAT TASTE, WILL BUY AGAIN;positive
I ordered three of the highest rated chili flakes to make Sichuan red chili oil / Hong You - not knowing which type I would prefer - so I made the recipe and divided it up with some of each brand.  This Korean Chili Flakes from Spice Jungle was hands down the winner.  Even though the others were tasty, this one had a depth and richness that had more of that thing they call 'umami', and just in general had a more ineffable perfection that hit all the right flavor elements you might look for in this spice.  Because I only ordered the 1 oz size for the taste test, I am now going to order the big size so I can make a big batch.;positive
This is a great tasting sweetener !;positive
The Apple Crisp flavor is good. I like that it's grain and gluten free. I've tried several of the flavors and they are all really good. I like to snack on it rather than use it for a cereal. I also add it to smoothies. I found this brand when I was on the 30-day Paleo diet. I'm not doing any kind of strict Paleo any longer, but I still buy this!;positive
"For whatever reason, buttermilk from the store has a very short shelf life.  It didn't used to be so.

Since we primarily use it for baking (bread in particular) we have found that this powdered buttermilk does the job perfectly and has a very long shelf life.  Sometimes we use it ""full strength"" and sometimes we add a tablespoon or so to whey from our homemade Greek yogurt.  Either way, it sure does the job.";positive
This almond butter is seriously the best. I always ask for it during holidays for a gift. It has a great taste and is not too sweet. This is the only brand I will ever buy because it is not too chunky and not too smooth. A happy medium. ( :;positive
Allows you to create a simple home made salad dressing that you, more than likely, have never tasted before.  It's unique, slightly sweet flavor,  will enhance any dish with a flavor that will have your guests smiling, and wanting more. Not your ordinary molasses.;positive
"This is excellent French roast coffee.  It's not over roasted/burnt tasting & the flavor is complex.  The beans are oily, black & I found no quakers (underdeveloped coffee beans that make coffee taste awful - they stick out because they do not roast/darken properly).  That's a good test of coffee beans:  empty the bag on a cookie sheet & see how many quakers you find.  A few is ""acceptable"" but more than 10 is pretty bad in my opinion.

I have also tried Cameron's Organic French Roast.  It is equally good but perhaps a little less intense.  For those who don't care for Starbucks French Roast - (I personally find it over roasted/burnt but ok) you may want to give this coffee a try.  If you prefer light roasted coffee or supermarket brands, both of these French roasts may not be your cup of coffee.

I use the ""pour-over"" method to brew coffee every day because at this time, there is only one non-commercial drip coffeemaker that gets water to the ideal brewing temperature of 192F to 204 F.  I use cold, filtered water, a Melitta natural brown filter, manual drip coffee filter & brew directly into my stainless carafe.  I heat the water to boiling, pour a few tablespoons over the grounds to saturate & plump up the beans, wait a couple minutes & then flood the grounds with the rest of the water.  There is a lot of crema, the beautiful reddish brown foam that develops on top of the beans, & it smells & tastes wonderful.

It's different from any honey I've ever tasted ... exceptionally good. Wonderful flavor, and I like the creamy consistency of it, too. I even like the color of it! Thank you, Uncle Henry. ... P.S. Oh, and I like the jar, too. So easy to spoon out the honey.;positive
The gummies make it easier to take.;positive
I like this.  There a warning about selling it in California due to proposition 65.  This makes me a little nervous.  I plan to research this before I buy more, because I know our oceans are contaminated.  I don't know how the poor dolphins/whales survive.;positive
Before purchasing, I read the reviews for this specific coffee and based on the many positives, I decided to buy it. I am glad I heeded those good reviews!  This coffee is delicious...and my tummy demands a light roasted coffee so this coffee fits the bill!;positive
Nice!!;positive
I must reorder.  Got three jars and gave two away. Keep this in your frig.  It has great taste, just a little hot.  I use it for veggie dip.  I bet it would be good mixed with a little olive oil for salad dressing.;positive
I love this stuff. It is great to eat peanut butter everyday without having to consume so much fat and so many calories. You can choose if you want a thick or creamy consistency which is nice. I use this to bake as well and the taste is awesome.;positive
We loved this. After driving by fields of white earlier this Summer, we saw the sign that it was Meadowfoam. I looked it up online and found out it makes great honey. So, had to give it a try. I'm sure I'll be buying it again.;positive
"There are a lot of things flavored with wasabi. And just one is way too much and you can hardly enjoy any more.

THESE ARE NOT THEY!

This is just the right amount of wasabi. Not too much to cause you to gag. Not so little that you wonder where the wasabi went.

But the most surprising thing is what the soy sauce adds to the taste. It's a wonderfully sweet/salty/rich taste that turns an ordinary almond into a full-fledged treat. Just one almond explodes in your mouth with a long-lasting taste.

Put these in salads or snack on their own.

My only choice would be if Blue Diamond put these in their 100-calorie packs to make it easier to keep from eating all 260 calories.";positive
Good cereal;positive
"I bake frequently and have been purchasing yeast from a local farmer's store (""old timey"" variety) for that reason.  The Saf-Instant product has provided the same rise times and results at about half the cost.  Trust me, I have been baking for YEARS, this is what you need.  Very impressed!";positive
"We are tuna fans and I was looking for a new way to serve it.  I read about this stuff on a cooking forum, so hurried to Amazon to buy some to try.  It couldn't be easier to prepare, and has a great taste and texture.  I first made the croquettes exactly as the package directs, but later batches I have added chopped bell peppers and onion to taste.  YUMMY.  We love this stuff and will be keeping it on hand for a quick and easy dinner.  Try it; you'll be surprised at how good and easy it is.";positive
"You can never go wrong with Simply Organic spices.  The paprika has a very bold, bright color, awesome aroma and great taste.  Would definitely recommend.  Love the square bottles; more efficient use of space and are reusable.  These jars fit perfectly in the spice racks from verticalspice.com";positive
Oh...my...God!  This is outrageously delicious!  I LOVE the tootsie fruit chews, but only ever am able to get them in that Halloween mixed pack.  I wondered if I could get those by themselves, and looked on Amazon, and sure enough!  But then I saw these...drool.  The candy is the (best ever sucker) candy from tootsie roll pops, but the inside is the totally delicious fruit chews!  SO good.  I love it!;positive
"I love paella.  There are few restaurants where I live that offer it and the ones that do charge a premium. So, cooking paella is one of my favorite things to do. There are a few MUSTS that go into a paella.  All of them are from Spain and include the rice, saffron, chorizo and paprika.

This rice was wonderful.  With the paella pan on the hot grill it turned out a wonderful, plump, slightly crispy browned rice.  It was to die for!  Everyone loved it.";positive
my kids gobble these up!!!!!;positive
"Yes.  Yes, it is.  The first time I used this yogurt starter in my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yogourmet-Electric-Yogurt-Maker/dp/B000N25AGO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yogourmet Electric Yogurt Maker</a>&nbsp;to make 24-hr SCD legal yogurt, it turned out a bit thin.  Then I tasted it.  Immediately I was literally stumbling around blindly while blinking away tears from the searing sourness in my mouth.  Of course, my family thought this was hilarious, but as I was unable to see them there wasn't much I could do about their misplaced mirth.

The next batch I made, I opened a second box of starter (and used whole milk instead of 2%) to see what happened.  It was perfect.  Smooth, light and creamy.  Mildly flavored (a little tart), and great with a little honey.

Evidently, I had issues with the first box, whether because I made an error in preparation or because the starter wasn't quite right, remains to be seen.  Either way, the second batch was delicious and that's good enough for me.

Definitely recommended!

**update**  I forgot to add: Use half milk and half ""1/2 and 1/2"" creamer for even creamier yogurt!";positive
This is the second time I have purchased them. It's a great value, and the quality is really good. I purchase these to eat raw, to toast for snacks and also to use to make my own almond milk. They work great for my purposes, so thank you!;positive
"This is the first time I have ever eaten these ""gigantes"" beans.  I cooked them, somewhat following a recipe I found online.  I also added some ingredients that I normally would add to make my navybean or great northern white bean soup.  I found these ""gigantes"" beans to be good, but they did not rise to the top of my fave bean list. I prefer the smaller navy bean or Great Northerns for soups, stews, or baked bean recipes. The ""gigantes"" beans have a somewhat distinctive aftertaste, which seems reminiscent of large lima beans.  So I will continue experimenting with these large beans and see what I come up with.  After all, ""I've never met a bean I didn't like"".";positive
It tastes to me, better than the Chocolate PB2, a bit saltier and more of a substantial pb taste to me.  I've reordered this and love it.  I give it four instead of five because it doesn't last as long as I'd like for the price.  I prefer a bulk size and cheaper.  Can be costly if you use it like real PB!;positive
Gift. She loved them.;positive
Product and service were good.;positive
I was disappointed in this purchase. Both my husband and I couldn't taste any difference between this and regular coffee. I expected it to have a tad more 'flavor' to it of spice. I won't purchase it again. It was, however ,packaged well and shipped promptly.;positive
OMG!!! EATING THIS STUFF AND FORGOING ALL OTHER BREADS AND CRACKERS AND CHIPS IS LIKE BEING REBORN in that It gives your body a chance to get rid of lots of TOXINS. This bread is delicious by itself toasted and buttered and when combined with quality deli meats and cheeses... IT IS INCREDIBLE!!! ALSO, THIS IS KOSHER AND HALAL!!! So, do something good for yourself and make God/Allah happy!!!;positive
Very very neutral to my taste.  Almost seems distilled.  I know too expensive to ship from Korea in glass bottles but I think would be more Appropriate for this type water.  Glass bottles make quite a difference in my view.for these  high end bottled waters;positive
I will never buy grocery store bay leaves again.  These are fresher and more pungent than any I have ever had before.  A pound is quite a lot and I am currently looking for new uses, but this is a far superior product.;positive
"You'll never guess that you're eating something good for you, let alone wheat-free. The country ranch flavor is by far my favorite and everyone who tries them wants more and asks where to buy them. I tell them that Amazon's price and service is the best.

Just know that the boxes and their contents are small. The manufacturer ""shrunk"" the boxes this past year.";positive
"I do have a thing for ginger. I have been through Ginger Altoid, Reeds Ginger Chew, and now The Ginger People Ginger Chew phases. I still enjoy all of these products, but the Ginger People chews are my favorite of the bunch.

I prefer them to Reeds because the ginger has just a wee bit more zing to me, and the quality is a bit more consistent. Reeds has had some problems with quality control of their product in my experience. It's gotten better lately, but is still a bit lax.

Ginger Altoids I enjoy simply for the convenience.

The calorie count of these chews is about the same as the Reeds chews, and I suspect the ginger content is very similar. I don't think it's necessary to scrutinize the labeling to realize that these are a ginger-flavored product, not real ginger.

They do help relieve nausea, and I'm not going to make any medical claims, but I eat a few of these every day, and my joint pain from osteoarthritis has all but disappeared. YMMV.

If you want to sample these before buying this rather sizable order of chews, Trader Joes does carry single bags. Buy one there, then come back and buy 12 boxes here.";positive
"This is Good turmeric that is still alive and will sprout. When left outside or inside the fridge but not frozen it will tend to mold a bit showing that its genuine. If bacteria or mold won't eat something I don't eat that either. Best way to store it is first wash it thoroughly under warm running water scrubbing each with your fingers. Pat dry them and put in a ziplock bag. Add 1 tablespoon of Apple Cider Vinegar per pound and shake the bag. Drain out the excess vinegar and seal the bag. This way it will store for over 3 months in regular fridge and its easy for you to just grab them and juice. If longer time is desired then just freeze them.

Turmeric is best not juiced by itself in large amounts. Don't do that. Its a powerful herb. Add one or two small roots to your regular vegetable juice daily. 5LB bag will last me around 3 months.
Turmeric is great for inflammatory conditions.

The seller initially made a mistake of shipping the wrong amount but later shipped the correct amount. I have no complains.";positive
"This is great rice! Superb quality, and easy to prepare. The only [small] downside is that the product package does not seal ""air tight"", so if you live in a high-humidity environment, you should put the bag of rice into a zip-lock bag, and consider putting a pack of desiccant (silica gel) into the zip-lock bag too. You can purchase desiccant via Amazon at a good price, and it is great for preserving freshness of any dry goods (herbs, rice, cereals, flour, etc).";positive
We buy this all the time;positive
Fabulous.....;positive
turns out there are a lot of organic foods that originate in china which pretty much means they are anything but organic and probably worse than U.S. grown non-organic. These seeds are U.S. grown. I will be searching for a U.S. grown organic supplier but for now these are good.;positive
It seems like the prices for these tubs has gone up in the past few months, maybe that's because their not as readily available...or so it seems.  This was the best price I could find for this flavor.  Product arrived within expected arrival dates.;positive
decent sized, tastes...edible but not spectacular. as it's my first time eating canned chicken breast, it does taste contained canned, and less fresh than your own boiled chicken breast, but it is convenient.;positive
I've been trying different brands of Colombian coffee, this is the best tasting so far for me, medium to stronger flavor,  smells wonderful after brewed.  Seems to be more coffee in these K cups than other name brands.  I'm happy with this brand!;positive
good cloves;positive
"Pros:
- Shelf stable for several months, making it a great backup when regular milk runs out
- Reasonably priced
- Tastes best when used in a recipe or on cereal or mixed with something else
- Screw off cap works well, easy open, easy seal

Cons:
- If you plan to drink it directly (not mixed with something else) it will taste strange, though not unpleasant

Highly recommended for ""just-in-case"" or for the prepper pantry/bunker.";positive
"For those who want to get all the benefits of dark chocolate without any processing, this is for you. These are raw, natural ""nibs"" of cacao. They aren't sweet like chocolate candy, and they can take some getting used to, but you don't need to eat a lot of this food to get the health benefits, only about a half teaspoonful of them per day.

Over the last four years there have been dozens of scientific studies analyzing and confirming substantial health benefits from a small amount of dark chocolate consumed daily. The latest findings from a Harvard study released in early 2011 indicate that as little as 6 gm. of dark chocolate (about 30 calories) is a sufficient daily ""dose."" That means you need very little of pure chocolate like these nibs.

The original German studies in 2007 used&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ritter-Sport-dark-chocolate/dp/B000PAM5DU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ritter Sport dark chocolate</a>, but I haven't so far been able to discover which kind of Ritter's dark chocolate was used by the researchers. However, since Ritter's only makes two types, 50% cacao and 71% cacao, this product's content of cacao goes far beyond the parameters of the dark chocolate used in that study.

The health benefits of dark chocolate are due to the flavonoids contained in cocoa. Flavonoids act as antioxidants in the body, which both prevent and reduce inflammation. Over many years of medical research, inflammation has been found to contribute to or directly cause a host of diseases, including high blood pressure, heart disease, and cancer, as well as autoimmune diseases like arthritis.

Flavonoids are found in the pigments of fruits and vegetables which give them their color. The darker and deeper the color of a fruit or vegetable, the greater the amount of flavonoids it contains. Cocoa is derived from the dark-brown cacao bean, which is the fruit of the tropical tree, theobroma cacao. In any chocolate product, such as this one, the higher the percentage of cocoa/cacao, the more flavonoids the chocolate contains.

Dark chocolate such as this product is better for your health than milk chocolate because it contains more antioxidants, which are good for you, and less sugar, which is not good for you--especially if you have diabetes or are struggling with your weight.

The FDA defines categories of chocolate based on how much cocoa/cacao is in a given product:
1. Unsweetened chocolate with no additives is 100% cocoa. Most all brands of unsweetened baker's chocolate fall into this category. Their ingredient list will state simply, ""chocolate."" This product is unprocessed cacao.
2. Bittersweet chocolate contains 35-99% cocoa (35% is the minimum), and it must contain less than 12% milk solids. There is a large range of products in this category, and the product names reflect the amount of chocolate they contain. Unsweetened chocolate is very bitter, and the more cocoa in a product, the less room for sugar, and the more bitter it will be. In order to avoid frightening off customers who are used to sweet chocolate, marketers often substitute the words ""dark,"" ""extra dark"" or ""intense"" for ""bitter"" if that word is not paired with ""sweet,"" for example as ""bittersweet"" or ""extra bittersweet."" This product lies at the top of this range.
3. Sweet chocolate contains 15-34% cocoa (15% is the minimum), and it must contain less than 12% milk solids. It is sometimes also marketed as ""dark chocolate,"" even though it has a much lower percentage of cocoa solids than bittersweet, which can cause consumers, in such cases, to purchase a product with less cocoa in it than they realized they were getting. Everything else besides the cocoa and milk solids is essentially sugar.
4. Milk chocolate is only required to have a minimum of 10% cocoa, a minimum of 12% milk solids and 3.39% milk fat. The rest is sugar and milk.";positive
"When Campbells says ""chunky"" they really mean it.  This soup is so good and very filling.  On nights when I don't feel like preparing a big meal I just dump this in a pan, heat it and eat it.  It has become one of my comfort meals and I do love my comfort meals.";positive
This coffee is the best.  If you haven't tried it, you should.  My husband and I discovered this coffee and it is all we buy for the ourselves.  In the store it is sold in small cans.  We prefer to grind our own beans.  Smart and Final used to carry this size in whole bean and discontinued it.  If you prefer a larger bag, the five pound bag is available through Don Francisco directly.;positive
So far I'm really enjoying this.;positive
It got here uber early. Like literally two and a half weeks early. But that's not even the start of it. This stuff is awesome. I'm not even a huge candy fan. This is amazing. I'd buy this again. And again. And again. And i actually likely will sometime. Worth every penny.;positive

"I drink up to four cups of Chamomile Tea a day and after trying every brand on the market Twinings is my favorite.  Some of the other brands have an unpleasant taste that reminds me of drinking hay.  It just has the best tasting chamomile flowers and that is the only ingredient so it better have the finest quality.  I add some honey for sweetener and it is the perfect hot drink for the afternoons and evenings when I don't want anymore caffeine.

In the summer I steep four bags of the tea with a quart of water and some honey and it makes a refreshing iced tea for the rest of the day.

If you are looking for a mellow and pleasing beverage that will be soothing and relax you in the afternoons this product is it.";positive

Since all the nuts have their own pros and cons, I mix all my nuts and dry fruits together namely, walnuts, peanuts, almonds, pumpkin seeds, hemp seeds, chia seeds and goji berry together and store in a glass jar. It is really good for health and taste as well. Before I had used Navitas Goji berries and wanted to try Viva Labs. The product is really great. I also add some of it in smoothies and soups as well. Happy that i discovered this super fruit.;positive

"Oh this is a marvelous tea! I'm not much for either camomile or lemon but in this combination it is fabulous. Both flavors are perfectly balanced. The lemon is so subtle that you have to focus on it to notice it when sipping it, but it is there.

The blend is so light. It is very soothing and relaxing. Even the aroma is calming. I actually can tell the difference in how I feel while drinking it. I drink it hot at bedtime if I'm having a difficult time falling asleep, and it works. It is wonderful anytime during a stressful day.";positive
Good flavor, but strong like all kcups are. I actually get 2 mugs of coffee from one kcup. I brew a small portion, set it aside, then & rotate the kcup 1/4 inch & make a second cup with the medium portion, then rotate the kcup another 1/4 inch, take the first cup and brew another small portion into it. This way I have 2 cups the way I like it.;positive

Wow! Just got my shipment yesterday and I already love them! Tiny, perfect, cinnamon chips. I couldn't resist opening a bag. They taste absolutely delicious. Not only did I buy them to make baked items with  but even a few make a lovely, sweet treat. I am imagining many possible cooking uses. Excellent cinnamon taste and scent. Will absolutely buy again in the future.;positive
It's pretty good for the price.;positive
"My favorite organic coffee and I have tried many!

I only buy Sumatra as I fell in love with it years ago and when I made the decision to go organic I had a hard time finding an organic brand that I liked as well as my ""old"" brand. I tried several others first... even tried some non Sumatra beans when I didn't find anything I liked. They were all more expensive and I guess I was expecting them to be better but each time I was disappointed. I finally ordered the Caf Altura Sumatran based on the reviews and have not looked back. Love it! I have it on subscribe & save and get 2 bags per month...";positive
Oh, it is great!;positive
A quick tasty snack;positive
While this is definitely tasty (I mean, chocolate, cheesecake, and hazelnut!), I found the cheesecake flavor is very weak.  That won't stop me from finishing the jar, obviously.  We like it with pretzels or vanilla wafers.;positive
"This is more like tahini soup instead of tahini paste. It is very thin and contains a bit too much oil for my taste. Flavor is somewhat on the bitter side. It does work well for most sauces and hummus tahina, but I'm cautious about using it in most dishes because it is so thin.

It's not very economical and even though I do like it, I won't keep it as a staple in the kitchen.";positive
"Ghirardelli Chocolate Mocha remains my favorite chocolate, not only for making hot chocolate, but for adding to coffee for a great mocha coffee. It provides a terrific chocolate flavor while avoiding the overwhelming sugary sweet taste of so many other chocolate cocoa mixes and it dissolves very easily leaving only a small amount of residue at the bottom of the cup. Unlike some other mixes, the mix is a true powder in consistency and leaves no particulate like some mixes.  One can actually taste the unique flavor and if one does prefer a sweeter taste, adding a little sugar works well. However, I have never needed to add anything. I have been using this for several years, starting when one could get this in the large can at very reasonable prices. My only disappointment has been the marked  inflationary pricing to be found almost everywhere over the past couple of years. Usually, in fact, the best prices can be found at the Ghirardelli on-line site itself. Nevertheless, I have purchased the mix from this seller and one other at Amazon.com at prices tending in the $6.00 on average per bag, usually getting it in the 6 package lots for $32.00 to $36.00 price range. This is still a bit expensive, especially compared to several years ago, but much lower than other sellers who are price gouging currently. Do be sure to price check carefully.  The taste and quality seem to have remained consistent. I gave it 5 stars because I am simply rating the flavor but if price was a greater concern, I would likely have rated it a 4 star, but the current price is not high enough to dissuade me from purchasing it.
I know that flavor is a very subjective thing, but if you like a real mocha flavor that allows the chocolate taste to come through without the sweet taste favored by children, you will probably enjoy this as much as i do.";positive
"Coconut goodness... certain bites you really get the taste from the Coconut oil.  Really nice tasting popcorn.

I decided to add chia seeds to my daily diet after hearing friends and family speak of the health benefits.  I chose Healthworks brand because of good reviews and price.  I compared pricing at our local health food store.  I am very pleased.  The seeds came in a vacuum pack bag and I opened it and now store the seeds in a mason jar.  The seeds are of good quality, and very clean. I will reorder when necessary.  I take 2 teaspoons daily in the morning.;positive
Delicious and healthy.;positive
I will definetly buy this again. It is very creamy and not full of chemical crap. If beverage is hot enough and willing to stir rigurously this dissolves quite well. Main thing is it is real milk, creamy and delicious. A lil pricey but well worth it I feel. Hard to find a real milk product out there that is pure like this in a powder. I use as back up when out of my favorite half n half. I  recommend it. Quick delivery too.;positive
poped ok;positive
I love this cereal - a variety of ingredients makes each bite different! I have Celiac so it's a really good gluten-free source of protein and fiber. I add it to lots of things and it's great with ice cream or yogurt. Terrific pricing here compared to supermarket and much easier to find!;positive
"I ordered this and the Cracked Pepper and Garlic flavors, both worked out well but I liked the original more.  I used this as exactly as I could to the volume of weight and it did seem a little extra salty - I know Jerky is supposed to be salty of course but if I had one and only one complaint it would be regarding that.  Next time I'll try limiting some of the salt and see how that goes, but either way I do recommend this product it's very easy to use and tastes good. Oh, I used this both for ground beef (using a jerky gun) and for flank steak pieces.

"Bought these to augment my morning oatmeal. They did not disappoint in terms of freshness or taste. Note that these are not candied or roasted. To get that really delicious hazelnut flavor, thrown them in a pan and roast them on high heat for a few minutes. Chopped over a breakfast cereal, there's really nothing better (except for perhaps pecans).

I would buy these again.";positive
Nice robust tea. My naturopath recommended this for my slightly elevated blood pressure, instead of coffee or other caffeinated teas. I make a jug of it and sweeten it with some stevia, I drink this and water instead of other not so healthy drinks. It's got a very satisfying flavor and you can make it lighter or stronger as you desire. You can drink it cold or hot. Im glad I found it here on Amazon as I was not able to find it locally.;positive
I love the fact that it doesn't contain high fructose corn syrup and has only 10 grams of sugar. I'll have to try the strawberry banana pie recipe on the back,it sounds delicious! I've used it to spoon on top of an angelfood cake and it was wonderful. I highly recommend it!;positive
GOOD taste  - go buy it~!;positive
Very fresh and yummy!;positive

My favorite coffee thus far!!! Love it!!! Great to doctor up or have on it's own! You live in Alaska or somewhere where the winter months are long or you lots of rain throughout the year with little sun...??! I personally recommend this with maybe some reishi, maitake, and turkey tail (symptom or health concern according and physician checked accordingly for personal needs) and one of those mid or high quality sun uv replacement lamps!;positive
"I love the Bai drinks they're awesome. The reason for 4 stars not 5 is that with my last variey box I received only 3 flavors instead of 4; I received 6 watermelon instead of 3 watermelon and 3 blueberry lemonade. Watermelon is my  least favorite flavor I just put up with it because I love the other flavors and that variety box.";positive
"This tea tastes so good! I love it. I'm on my second big bag. I like that it is green tea but its not bitter like other teas that I've tried. The description says caffeine free but its not as green tea does have caffeine.
I really love that the company sends samples of other teas. Yummy stuff!";positive

Really enjoy having no salt;positive
I like this tea because it does help suppress my appetite, but the spice was a little to overpowering for me.  If you are not a huge fan of spice, do not order this tea.  If you like a little bit of spice, this tea is ok for an every few days type of consumption.;positive

Been looking for this In stores with NO LUCK, should of just came on Amazon ( wasn't thinking) HAPPY, HAPPY, just ordered more to have cus I am not a coffee drinker and love this, Love That It came In separate cans to keep fresh, DELICIOUS  chocolate  price Is GREAT, no complaints from me, HAPPY  + FAT FREE Is exactly what I was looking for, Hersheys came through ;positive
Can't ask for a better product. Crisp and tasty. A good quality product. The taste is not heavy yet not light. Some family members place some of these inside a sandwich like bologna and cheese. They can also be placed on a hamburger to get that extra BBQ taste.;positive
I love this product.  I have Celiac Disease and have never had an issue.  My favorite thing to use this for is making dumplings - 3/4 cup GF Bisquick, 1/3 cup milk, 2 tablespoons melted butter, 1 tablespoon parsley.  I heat up a can of chicken broth and have lunch in 10 minutes.  Chop up the dumplings or add a little more bisquick to thicken.  Salt and pepper to taste.  Add canned or rotisserie chicken if desired, vegetables are also good.  This recipe doubles or triples very nicely if you need more than 1-2 servings.  I have also made pancakes with this and they are good as well.  I tried the pizza crust and wasn't a fan.  If you are not on a gluten-free diet, I wouldn't recommend this product.  You would be better off just buying regular bisquick as this is much more expensive.;positive
"I've been eating low carb for almost two years and had been serving my family a LC pasta (Dreamfields).  Then recently I was diagnosed gluten & casein sensitive so that pasta was out.  After trying a box of this from my local natural foods market my husband declared he absolutely LOVED the taste.  So I ordered it from Amazon for a better price and stocked up my pantry.  I still alternate for myself between this and spiral-sliced zucchini (made with the World Cuisine Spiral Slicer I bought on Amazon--see my review on that).

As other reviewers have said, you definitely have to time it just right; don't overcook it or you will be disappointed.  Otherwise, great pasta!";positive

"There are three varieties in this package. They basically equate to light, medium, and dark roast. The biggest thing about this coffee is that we (my wife and I) could not get over how smooth it is. There is no bitter aftertaste whatsoever. We're very pleased with this coffee and our personal favorite is the One Luv (medium roast).

PROS: Variety, smoothness, no bitter aftertaste
CONS: The light roast (Get up, Stand up!) tended to be a tad too weak for our liking";positive
I have tried three different ghee products from local health food stores (including making my own) and ordered Pure Indian Foods via on-line after reading other reviews, they were right this is clearly among the best quality ghee out there.  Even though its a little more expensive, I am very satisfied with product and I have re-ordered serveral times since;positive
"I didn't actually realize I was getting organic Tostitos until I took them out of the box. I looked at them rather askance since I don't think everything has to be organic; some things can just be plain good without necessarily being totally good for me. I got out my homemade guacamole and my home canned salsa and some nacho cheese and put these Tistuties to the test. I will be buying many many more bags of these, They are lighter and crunchier than regular Tistutis and at the same time, they can bear a heavier load of cheese. salsa and guacamole at one time than the regular ones can. Hands dpwn these are the best!";positive
I wish I could live on these;positive
Very nice colors! I see 6 colors, not 4. Because you can make orange and purple. You could actually also make brown and black. Unfortunately, purple was not a successful mix. Unless it take a rocket scientist to pull it off, and that I am not, I couldn't get a vibrant purple color. It was more of a mute lilac. The orange mix looked great.;positive
These go in all my smoothies.;positive
Very good coffee.  No complaints;positive
This coffee has great flavor, very smooth, earthy flavor. It came packed extremly fresh roasted, medium dark. If you like it strong, I suggest that you add a little more coffee, eg for 10 cups, add enough coffee for 11-12 cups. Its that smooth.;positive
product as expected;positive
This stuff is like liquid gold in the kitchen, and not the least bit like nearly all the other salt-laden products out there.  I warm this with 3 parts water then finish with a pat of butter before serving.  The result is worth the price and a bit more when paired with a beef tenderloin.;positive
I am on a diet so no sugar for me. I am not into artificial sweeteners that can kill brain cells (aspartame). Also wanted something that had no carbs. And tastes like sugar. That is a big order. Erythritol tastes like sugar, no carbs. Doesn't kill brain cells. It is natural. Everything I wanted!;positive
"Cherry Jolly Ranchers are definitely the best flavor (calm down fans of other flavors--this is just one guy's opinion), and this package was the only way to get just the Cherry.  They arrived fresh and tasty, exactly as hoped.  Some of the other stix from different suppliers are a bit ""off"" in taste and sort of melted within each wrapper.";positive
Love it in my coffee and for baking;positive

I have used this brand before. Safeway online used to carry them.  They are the large ones most everyone uses, but safeway online (jack up the prices on everything) charged $3.50 and then stopped carrying them.  These are way overpriced.  Buy a big bag (Amazon has many choices) and and you're set for quite a while!;positive
Fresh and green --  and --  almost more importantly --  came in two sealed packages that have a zip-lock seal to close once opened.  I was very impressed and I wish all the bulk herbs I buy came packaged so well.;positive
"A year or so back I tried SunMaid's mixed Jumbo Raisins & fell in love with big raisins. For some reason my local Safeway isn't stocking them regularly anymore so I came online to Amazon to find them. I found this seller's Jumbo Golden Raisins & bought a 5 lb bag - sure it would last forever since its just the two of us now - not so!

They arrived quickly in a huge bulk bag - a little surprising in this age of strong marketing packaging. But hey - the price is fabulous. The raisins are even better! Hugh - incredibly plump - sweet - pure, BIG raisin flavor.

My husband & I have always enjoyed oatmeal but recently for health reasons have switched to oatmeal every day - we both toss a handful of these raisins into our oatmeal for a punch of sweet and chewy fruitiness. I've also cooked with them (Carribean Zucchini Bread!) and they're wonderful then too.  We'll be reordering this item from this seller by the end of the month. They're going fast.";positive

GREAT FLAVOR AND PACKAGED WELL.;positive
"This tea is both convenient and delicious. I have tried several varieties and I have enjoyed them all. They taste like fresh-brewed and nothing like instant tea. I take these with me in my purse and I can easily turn a bottle of water or cup of hot water into a lovely tea. I have recently begun drinking Hint water and I like adding Pique tea to the different flavors of hint and I have a lot of variations with no sugar or calories. I also like that the package shows the level of caffeine. I drank some a little late one night and I should've heeded the ""moderate caffeine"" warning on the  label. I was up most of the night! It also saved me in the hospital when they would only serve me decaf tea. With no tea bag to find, I was able to empty a packet into my decaf tea and transform it into something tasty and no caffeine withdrawal headache!";positive
"Love this syrup. Initially bought it to play with, to work on some pairings (I'm a pastry chef), and I ended up using it in everything but what I'd bought it for. I'll be buying a 2nd bottle soon. I thin slice fresh organic lemons and drop them in a quart mason, muddle with the end of the spoon, add filtered water, seal, shake, and rest in the fridge overnight. You get the lemon oil and the juice but not the bitter from the pith. I strain it, dump it in my Vitamix, add ice and violet syrup and blast it to slush, using the plunger. This syrup sweetens the drink perfectly. No need to sweeten the lemon-water!

Such a happy customer!";positive

"I love these crusts.  Only caveats are to use them in a timely manner (some of mine got too old and smelled bad; I'm going to try freezing my new ones to see if they stay better).  They do tend to crumble if hit (my current batch seems to have been hit in shipment), but they still taste good.";positive

They are cheap, tasty and only contain 30 calories each. There is no reason to avoid trying them!

( And let's face it, their convenient  shape make them very easy to cram into the mouths of crying children! It shuts them up every time!... sure they weren't OUR kids and strangers definitely  disapprove  of random people shoving odd food into their child's  mouth, but it works none the less!)";positive
It is the first time I'm trying this.  the smell for some of these is definitely over powering, but once baked in they are pretty good.  I love to bake so natural flavors will always win, but when in a cinch this is fantastic.  I have used the red velvet to make cakes as well as cookies.  Though I find it is fantastic for adding the right kind of color, the flavor is quite bland.  Make sure you use some good dutch cocoa to make up for that, it will be a huge hit paired with a deep rich color the red velvet emulsion gives you.  The princess flavor is ok,  the smell again over powering to the point of nausea, but once baked in, it gives a certain hint of something special.  I have tried the buttery dough and peppermint as well,  both were fantastic in cookies as well as cakes and frosting.  A little bit goes a long way, honestly you don't need to use more then a 1/2 teaspoon for a volume of 2-3 cups.  these emulsions are very very strong.  Personally I would use these in conjunctions with extracts as those are more natural flavors,;positive
these take some getting use to, the slick texture reminds one of the fruit roll-ups the kids love. One should not that to hold in sandwich ingredients one should take them off the paper sheet and place ingredients on the slick side, that way the slick side sticks to the wrap and you stand a better chance of the wrap staying together.  nice balance of savory and sweet great for gluten free sandwich.;positive
I've tried other cocoa powders, but keep returning to this one for its good taste and affordable price. I use it almost exclusively for making hot chocolate: mix 2 Tblsp. cocoa with 1 Tblsp. sugar and a pinch of salt, stir in a little milk or soymilk (or cream!) until you have a smooth paste, stir in more milk, microwave, add a little vanilla. You have smooth, intense chocolate flavor with a slightly bitter note. --So much better than the weak, overly sweet mixes sold in stores!;positive
"I have been using erythritol in baking for about a year now.  After trying nearly every kind of sugar replacement, I have finally settled on this one.  It measures cup-for-cup like sugar, making it easy to adapt recipes and it acts just like sugar when it is baked.  Other artificial sweeteners turn baked goods dry or cakey or crumbly, but this stuff is PERFECT.

It does have a slight ""cooling"" taste; not exactly minty.  I don't mind it, but it does make it difficult to use with some flavors.";positive
Tried this because it is 100% Kona and much cheaper than the other national brands I have been using. What can i say i am greatly surprised. Mild, no bite too it and no discernable acidity. This is on my shopping list from now on.;positive
"After having tremendous problems with immune system issues, particularly in the gut with IBS, I had a doctor that thought I had gluten issues. I was tested for this during upper GI endoscopy and the test showed negative. The only thing I know for certain is that I cannot digest meat very well. I am not a vegan, but my body has moved me more and more in that direction because I cannot digest meat without massive stomach issues and I felt hungry and tired all the time. On the quest for a protein supplement that doesn't come from animals, I discovered this product.

First and foremost, this is not the best tasting thing you ever tried, but the taste will grow on you. Make sure you are mixing it properly and with COLD water. I have the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cuisinart-CSB-76BC-SmartStick-200-Watt-Immersion-Hand-Blender-Brushed-Chrome/dp/B000EGA6QI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cuisinart CSB-76BC SmartStick 200-Watt Immersion Hand Blender, Brushed Chrome</a>&nbsp;and this is what I use to mix mine. It's so easy! I add about 8 oz water, instead of the recommended 6 oz and this gives me a better blend.  By the way, while people are going on and on about how bad this is. It is not that bad. As I said, the taste will grow on you, but if you're not mixing it fully, it can be quite chalky. BTW, I use the chocolate flavor and if you're mixing right, it DOES taste like a chocolate shake. In the beginning, I didn't mix mine well using a standard blender and it tastes bad if you don't get it fully mixed. I switched to the hand blender, which does a marvelous job and so much easier to clean up afterward.

All of that aside, the real question is, does it work? Do you have more protein? Do you feel differently while taking this supplement. The answer to all of those for me is absolutely YES! Not only do I feel more energized (I have two shakes a day now), my IBS is practically a thing of the past. The great thing about this product is that it contains probiotics and these are different than the usual kind you see in pill form. I never noticed any difference with the probiotic pills, but with this, I am more ""normal"" than I've ever been. Perhaps it's the combination of the raw protein and the probiotics and the amino acids? I have no idea, but it's rare I can say this: It has changed my life!

I have never felt this good in my life, no really, never. I noticed it just after two days of use, so I discontinued using it to see if it was just placebo effect. Within 3 days, all my old gut issues came back, so I went back on this supplement and now I'm never going off. Even my mood is so much better and when people notice and say how happy you seem and what are you doing different - then you know you're onto something. It's amazing how much happier I am when I'm not malnourished and sick to my stomach all the time. I never thought I would feel well enough again to live life fully, but I am now. I have been telling everyone that if people knew how much better this stuff could make them feel, they couldn't keep it on the store shelves. Maybe I was just that bad off, but I can't believe this powder has made all that difference, but it has. Even my seasonal allergies have improved since taking this product. What in the world is in this stuff? I don't know, but I hope they never stop making it. I'm on the subscription plan now. I call this my prescription because it works better than all the stomach pills the doctors had me on and this has given me no side effects.

If you are having digestion issues, please give this a try. You might be as lucky as me and see a huge difference in the way you feel. I feel awful for people that are suffering, like I was. This might do the trick for you, too.";positive
I'm guessing they're gluten free because they lack vanilla. To make them you must supply your own vanilla. I made 2 boxes of this, one with the directions followed EXACTLY --they came out very dry and brittle, and one with extra water and a little bit of oil-- they came out less dry...which is what I thought would happen. I don't like dusty cookies. The flavor is good though, I would buy this again but I would modify the recipe so as to have soft moist cookies.;positive
This brand of cereal in three flavors has become my wife's favorite breakfast.  Only one other cereal competes though my huevos rancheros and omelettes are still her biggest faves.  She orders this cereal as soon as the last bag is opened.  I'm not a cold cereal fan, so I can't really add anything except to say, happy wife... happy life.;positive
Nice flavor works just like regular chips. I made a fantastic ganache that made delicious truffles.  Best feature after taste, there is no digestive upset. Never had a sugar free sweet that didn't cause some pretty severe discomfort. Turned around and bought 6 more and will keep buying it. there are better prices out there though.;positive
Thank you !;positive
These make the tastiest sugar cookies.  Everyone always asks me for my sugar cookie recipe.  They are shocked when I tell them its Krusteaz, then they always go buy it and thank me later when people ask for their recipe :);positive
"I am a seafood lover. And I have been looking for a good hearty Crab soup. Well, I HAVE FOUND IT. I shared it with my sister who also said ""Delicious soup"". I WILL BE GETTING A CASE OF THIS SOUP EVERY OTHER MONTH (on Subscribe & Save) AND SHARING A BOWL OR TOO WITH MY FAMILY. (And here's a suggestion. Try it with Oyster Crackers. Hard to believe, but it even makes it MORE AMAZING!!!!!) I love this soup! Thanks Campbell's.";positive
I have been using this brand for quite awhile. They have a great taste, but only have 10grams of protein. I eat every two hours...and these shakes manage to keep me working. I use them in between meals and usually along with breakfast. I have noticed the price slowly going up on them, and have been looking at alternatives;positive
My kids (as well as my husband and myself) were very happy to find this syrup. It tastes wonderful and I love the fact that it's sweetened with Maltitol, instead of artificial chemical sweeteners. (We try to stay away from those.) I think it's worth the money (for the amount we use). This is now the only syrup we'll be using at our house. =);positive
One of my favorite noodles, will definitely repurchase. It doesn't taste too much like chicken to me, instead more like a sweet spicy flavor. It also comes with a packet of tiny seaweed strips w/ sesame seeds to go on top. Easy to make as well. But the instructions don't make sense, telling you to boil the noodles with a large amount of water and then drain. I followed the Chapaghetti instructions instead, using about 350ml (or a little less) of water to make it so that no draining was necessary.;positive
Nice fresh nibs that taste good.;positive
Came in fresh!;positive
This product has such a wonderful, refreshing & delicious taste! GREAT product and no caffeine which is good when you do not need caffeine but you do want a sweet, delightful drink at work in the afternoon! and of course no calories!;positive
Nicely smokey, good flavor.;positive
Very tasty stuff and very spicy!;positive
good taste -- easy to use;positive
My husband loves this curry paste (I do not eat fish and it has shrimp paste, so beware of that). I often buy this and the yellow curry, mix the curry with some coconut and put in some lightly softened veggies, and boom - Delicious. I also like to make a crockpot curry that simmers all day, you could do any meat/veggie/potato combo. He says it is restaurant quality!;positive
My son's favorite brew.;positive
Ta great product for the money.;positive
These are very tasty, but I have stopped buying them as they are now prohibitively expensive.  When they reduce the price back to the approximately $9 they were earlier this year (including shipping) from the almost $18 they are selling them for now, I will buy them again.;positive
These are best I've found in a can.;positive
Just as i remembered! Amazing!;positive
My favorite pasta!;positive
like this more for your money;positive
love Amy's!;positive
I bought this same salmon directly from the Caviar Express before and it was delicious. I figured that I'd try ordering it through Amazon just to see what happens. It arrived with a bunch of cold packs and was very tasty. The salmon is moist, sliced thin and fatty the way I like it. The grocery stores near me don't stock high-end lox so unless I want to drive 45 minutes each way to whole paycheck this is the only way that I can get it. It lasts unopened in the refrigerator for about a month.;positive
"Buying bulk is the way to go.  Just know two pounds is a LOT and beats the tar out of the prices you will pay for smaller bags.  These are just simply seeds with no added anything, just what I was looking for.  I use them in my own trail mix and granola creations.  They are especially good toasted a little with or without oil and tossed in salads or soups.  Sometimes just a handful on the way by the pantry is satisfying.  This brand fulfilled its promise.

I am one among many trying to find alternative, healthy, gluten free, unprocessed, non-gmo snacks.  Unadulterated nuts and seeds are excellent choices to fill that bill.  Give these to the kids and get them off the junk food. Jazz them up with some dried fruit and they will surprise you when they want more.";positive
"At one time I bought ""Great Grains"" from the supermarket, ate it as a cereal, & it cleaned my insides out much like chilly. I said
to myself, the next time i buy  ""Great Grains"", I'll eat it as a snack along with the rest of the snacks. I would recommend buying
this product.";positive
I experiment with lots of different flours & generally use this in place of 1/2 cup of all purpose flour for breads or muffins.  It gives it a kind of sweet nutty type taste.  When I make muffins, my husband can't stay away from them.  He'll eat 5 or 6 in a day with nothing on them....just dry, so I had to come up with ways to make muffins more nutritious and this works.;positive
I love this tea. Delicate flavor and good for settling my stomach. Sometimes - not often - the bags will come open and spill leaves into my cup which is mildly inconvenient but annoying. I drink 3 cups a day.;positive
Good item fast shipping fair price;positive
I like that these are better for the kids then other pops however they do prefer the other pops given the option, so they must have a flavor they are not super fond of. I keep these at home as opposed to the other so they have no choice, they will have one from time to time but are not gang busters about them like the sugar ones.;positive
"I'm almost 50yrs old, and Chuckles have always been my favorite candy.
These arrived quickly, intact, and fresh.
I'm not sure how long a 5lb bag will last me, but no complaints so far.
Happy with my purchase.";positive
Made good muilti grain bread.;positive
Campbells White and Wild Rice Soup....We had purchased this soup for many years locally until the store did not stock it anymore Can't find this soup in our local stores .,,,My husbands favorite...Glad we can find it on line...Very tasty...;positive
I don't usually like fruit pastries or other fruit sweets. But as a celiac, I miss poptarts, the cinnamon ones. So I tried these and the strawberry ones for the heck of it, and find they are both absolutely de! icious. I toast them and, blush, put extra butter on top. Exercised hard today, and with fruit, coffee and omelet, had THREE for supper!!! STILL, GLUTINO, PLEASE MAKE SOME CINNAMON ONES!   ;positive
Super strong coffee!  If you are someone who drinks coffee at diners and such trust me this will be much too strong for you.  If you're used to strong espressos, you are likely to enjoy this or if you grew up on the kind of java you could cut with a knife! (lol).  I cannot stand weak coffee, it is one of the reason I switched from my Keurig, I could never get a strong enough cup without using almost four k's and even then it was weak. This is very dark and very good!;positive
Smell reminds me of a Hawaiian vacation and the richness of the oil is great.  It's solid in the container, but turns liquid at skin temperature.  It doesn't leave a greasy film on my skin, either.  It looks oily at first, but within minutes it soaks in and my skin just feels soft.  I've used it on my hair, left it on a half hour before shampooing, and it makes my hair look a little shinier.  I haven't yet used it to eat, and probably won't.  But if it tastes as good as it smells, it would probably be delicious.;positive
Dr. Oz's show on ancient grains sparked my interest in this grain.  I read about it in the popular online sources and was thrilled to find out the Bob's Red Mill had produced it.  While Amazon carries it in bulk, I was hesitant in purchasing a large quantity until I had tried it.  I opt for the smaller consumer version via Amazon but it was expensive.  It turned out to be worth the extra expense.  The grain cooks up nicely in a small crock pot I purchased for this purpose.  I added dried fruit and nuts to add variety to the grain.  The grain has rich nutty wheat flavor and a touch of honey perfectly complements its flavor.  Now, I need to purchase several more food containers so that I may purchase the bulk quantity from Amazon.  UPDATE:  June 2016 -- Still love this grain. Cooks up nicely and delicious with dry fruit such as blue berries, goya berries or mulberries.;positive
"I am so pleased that there is a Bisquick product that is gluten free!

With this gluten free Bisquick mix I can now confidently bake cakes, cookies and coffee cakes.  I use any regular recipe from any cookbook and use this in place of the wheat flour and all leavening agents - baking powder/baking soda, etc.  This is a perfect mix of flours, gar gum and more.  Again, I can now make any baked recipe with ease and confidence.";positive
I hadn't had Chicken a la King for at least 40 years but I'm glad I tried a case of Swanson's. A very flavorful and satisfying product on noodles or to pour over toast. And you sure can't beat the price and convenience! I like having extra cans in the pantry for a last-minute dinner.;positive
"These are dangerously delicious! I'm torn between: ""get them away from me before I inhale them!"" and, ""order some more, right away!"" They are every bit the bio-equivalent of the Samoa Girl Scout Cookies. At first, when they arrived, I wasn't sure that they had the right amount of ""give"" to them, but realized that they must have been frozen for shipping. Once they thawed, they were out of this world. If Amazon made a Dash button for these cookies, I'd be ruined, but at least I'd have a smile on my face!";positive
"I love the taste of this hearty bread which is reminiscent of old world Rye bread with seeds and Pumpernickel - along with chopped nuts.  A thick slice of this whole grain bread is a very filling meal.

This bread is also crumbly even when frozen and the only reason I do not give it five stars.";positive
I tried Better Than Pasta for the first time, and LOVE IT. To stay low carb, I've also tried Miracle Noodle (another konjac noodle) and kelp noodles and this is by far the best of the bunch. It must be the addition of the oat flour that creates that lovely mouth feel. The initial thought that popped into my head when I tasted these was that they were very similar to Japanese ramen noodles. I also love that there are 4g of fiber.;positive
Perfect for home use.  Our local chain store has made the containers so large you need two hands to hold and pour.  Then to much comes out at once and gets all over counter/table.  Price was good and ordered 5 cases at once.  Will definitely be ordering again.;positive
We added a touch of non-fat vanilla creamer to this, along with an envelope of Splenda. It was drinking a fattening dessert, and took away the cravings for something far more detremental to the waistline! This butter toffee coffee is wonderful for after dinner, or any time you crave something sweet. I'll definitely be back for more.;positive
i received  my 3 pack yesterday and one stick is gone ,all by myself, temps are in the 60s here in orlando ,they are all very fresh packed in plastic bag for all three sticks ,price is great,you do not want to order ? fine ,more for me ,have a good day !;positive
This seasoning is great on almost all vegetables we eat. I love Rosemary, basil and oregano in this. We like it so much, we gave it as Christmas gifts. Always keep it on hand. I would like a bigger bottle choice ax it goes fast. Great with sauted mushrooms, onions, beet greens, spinach.;positive
It's decaf coffee need I say more.;positive
The flavor is not as strong as I was hoping and the color is kind of brownish, rather than purple. But it is carb and calorie free and made with sucralose only. No sugar alcohols. Great to use with my greek yogurt.;positive
best brand I have ever tried.  Some others had a woody taste, but this taste just like a deliciously sweet coconut without being over powering with the coconut flavor.  I love it in a smoothie, cream soups, and matcha tea latte.;positive
Great product......;positive
Mmmmm.;positive
Good chocolate chips.;positive
Best tasting tea;positive
Will buy again - great quality;positive
I recently went gluten free after struggling with stomach and other issues for years. I hated having to cut out all the delicious bread / carbs from my diet but it is better than dealing with the aftermath of eating gluten. I have tried different snacks and breads (some had the worst gag potential ever) but couldn't find something that I could really enjoy until these wonderful pretzels. Thank you Glutino for making something that we can all eat without any issues. I love the buttery flavor and crisp texture.;positive

I now love oatmeal! It good for I hear, this us fast easy delicious real peach taste. If you want more peach, I say get frozen , not canned, peaches and keep some in fridge un thawed to top your oatmeal as it cools. Enjoy and if it it's been some time since you tried or every ate hot cereal oatmeal, cream of wheat..grit.. And whetina are 1950's hot breakfast, today IRS minutes in a microwave for a good breakfast. Let amazon. Pack it in your monthly subscription order.;positive
Very good, satisfies!;positive
The 4 stars is because this product doesn't not blend well if you're adding it to a coffee or hot chocolate. When you figure out how to mix this product well though, it tastes just like whole milk to me. I'm thinking the next time I'll throw in a bit of cocoa powder to make chocolate milk. So the key to mixing this properly is a lot of elbow grease with a whisk or a blender. What I just recently discovered / realized is a Blender Bottle works fantastic. I would still like to be able to add it to my milk so that yet has to be figured out.;positive
what can I say these were gone in a day so that should be all that is needed!  These were priced so well that I could have only bought a little less than half of them for this price at the convenience stores around my house;positive
My son is really into the paleo lifestyle.  These are truly fun to use as special gifts, but way too expensive for a regular treat.  They are dry, a little blah...unless you have been without cookies for a year...  Then they are yummy!  Lol;positive
exactly was i was expecting;positive
Honestly, I was shopping for organic turmeric, was having a hard time deciding which one to get, had two in my cart and forgot to remove one. Ended up with both, so I just have this on a shelf until we use up the other brand. Which should be within the next few weeks. We use a lot of turmeric.;positive
As others had said when I contemplated this purchase, these are as good as it gets - the aroma is excellent and clean.  Some idiot on here said that toasting the seeds (e.g. for tahini) would ruin the nutritional benefits of these seeds.  Welp, maybe if you toss them into a fire.  There is nothing wrong with toasting them and I chose black seeds because they have the seed hull and so basically more nutrition than white hulled seeds.;positive
This Organic Turmeric from Organic Spices is potent, powerful and delicious. I've had it for almost a month. After speaking with the friendly, helpful and knowledge customer service (this should be a giving when dealing with a company's CS but not every company express the importance of CS) I decided to choose Organic Spice over all the other Turmeric listing on Amazon. They were able to answer all questions and concerns, and even share a few consumer suggestions on usage. The product arrived and it smelt amazing. I could wait so I dip a spoon in and tasted a small bit...IMHO best tasting Tumeric I've had to date. Fast foward a couple nights ago: I've been having horrible insomnia brought on by and over thinking mind. I remembered seeing a video on Golden Milk aka Tumeric Milk. At 1 AM in the morning I found myself making the drink (even forgetting to add coconut oil) and it was delicious...30 mins later I was asleep. I made it last night and was out by 10 PM. I physical feel good, recharged if you will. Unless someone I personally know give me another brand of Turmeric to taste, I only know Organic Spices from here on out. Now that I've ddiscoveredTumeric Milk the club size will last me 90 days (fingers crossed). If you can't tell by this long review, yes, yes, yes I highly recommend their Organic Tumeric ;positive
We are trying to cut out all GMO foods from our diet and this was one of the only Ramen products available that is certified Non-GMO. We were disappointed that it wasn't made here in the United States and that there are very limited flavors. However, it is nice that my husband can still have Ramen once in a while and not feel as though he is ingesting poison each time he eats it.;positive
came quickly and tastes good;positive
We love these almonds;positive
It is a good cup of coffee;positive
Love this tea bold and fresh taste;positive

I've had some digestive problems & ordered this highly recommended Dandelion Root Tea to have on hand.  Little did I realize just a few days after its arrival, I'd have a bad session due to a side effect of a medication I take regularly.  For a couple of days this was the only liquid I could handle without bringing on abdominal discomfort.  I've found now that adding a Dandelion Root teabag to a hot cup of apple juice, makes a tasty beverage to enjoy with solid foods & helps my digestive system to act more normally. Sure glad I had it on hand when I needed it!;positive
Ugh - I meant to order whole bean and goofed.  Sigh.  Oh well - my bad.  As ground coffee goes this is perfectly good and we'll certainly drink it.  But I will be happy when it's gone & then I'll get back to the whole bean.;positive
"What can I say?  I love this stuff.  The packaging and nutrient profile speak for themselves.

This powder packs wholesome ingredients and a ton of protein into a very healthy shake. I use it for a snack in between meals or do 4 scoops if I missed a meal.  Their serving size is only 270 calories for 2 scoops,  which is hardly a meal.

I wish there were more fat in this,  to help keep you fuller longer.  It shouldn't be too hard with the nuts and seeds they have in here,  but it might mess with the longevity.

I've been buying this product once a month for the last 2-3 years and don't plan on stopping anytime soon.  It's great!";positive
I really like the idea of the flavors and ingredients in the salad. It's more of a 4 than a 5 star food to me. It doesn't seem quite as bright and fresh and flavorful as it could possibly be, but try it out. You might love it.;positive
If you don't usually like flavored teas, but have a hankering for something different, this tea could be for you.  Lychee, like jasmine, is a classic flavoring, and this tea shows you why, with a complex fruit taste that is not cloying.  I am enjoying it very much.;positive
Illy is the name in italian ground espresso, the flavor does not hold up well to lattes or cappacino but stand alone its great.  super strong,  i drank this on sun morning and i proceded to build a massive garden and i dring a triple shot of espreso every morning.  so this is gooooood;positive
"This is my go-to tea when ever I'm feeling ""cloudy"" or sluggish and even sick.  It's mild, has all the herbs that help for almost any ailment.  I ev.  en add it to other teas.  It's a staple.  I love triple leaf tea.  I'm a frequent buyer of several of their blends.";positive
"These are extremely dry vanilla beans, and although it's best to use the grade B beans for making vanilla extract, I had a very difficult time slicing them open-compared to other beans.

 I sliced each bean in half lengthwise and tried to scoop out as much of the insides with a knife. I added the 25 split beans, as well as everything I was able to scoop out into a 1.75L bottle of vodka. Put the lid back on and shake well. Shake once a day for the first two weeks and then once every few days thereafter. You will have to taste it periodically to see when you've reached your desired vanilla extract flavor. Typically it's best to wait at least 3 months for the flavor to be robust enough.";positive
"McCormick Cinnamon Sugar is truly special. A mixture of ground cinnamon and granulated sugar doesn't cut it (yuck!). You've got to have ""McCormick Cinnamon Sugar"" on your Creme of Wheat and oatmeal. Boy, do I pour this stuff on. Want to make French Toast to die for? Sprinkle liberally on both sides. So tasty. Syrup isn't necessary! Enjoy.";positive
So overall the product is nice, serves it's purpose as a dutiful almond paste however I did taste it out of the can and ended up using it in my almond cake and found that while it bakes perfectly, you may want to cut back on the sugar just a little in your recipe. The paste smelled wonderful, was fresh and easy to use. Will use and purchase again but next time I know to cut back a little on the sugar when working with it :-D;positive
"Received these quite quickly considering they're shipped from Japan.  I'd not heard of this type of candy and was surprised at the powerful punch these little candies give.  They're about the size of a dumdum sucker (no stick) and individually wrapped.  I received 4 of every flavor shown on the package.  I like that there is a 'cheat sheet' of the flavor for each color.  The fizzy-ish bite must be a citric acid component..reminded me of a candy from the 70s ...Zaps?...  Am not much of a fan of the melon flavor, but the rest are terrific!

Not quite sure why these are labeled ""noisy"" but I'd definitely recommend them!";positive
Great stuff we love it;positive
This is my family's favorite flavor and its nice to be able to buy a 24 pack of only this flavor.  Local warehouse club forces you to buy a variety pack.  Only thing is the price is just so-so at about $1/can.  Warehouse club beats that slightly.;positive
Great stuff will buy again.;positive
"Canned tomato products usually contain such high sodium content.  I was very glad to find this ""no salt added"" sauce from Muir Glen.  I don't miss the salt at all, and can add it to other sauces to cut the sodium.  Muir Glen products are always fresh and great tasting and are organic so we don't have to worry about chemicals.
Amazon's price makes it even better!";positive
In most Indan restaurants, chicken tikka masala is a milder (though complex) dish. This product brings the heat. In you like a hotter taste, you'll find it versatile for all kinds of reciples. Because it can be reconstituted as a paste (less water) rather than a sauce, I have used it in sandwches. The sauce is typically served over rice, but if you'd like it over pasta or rice noodles, no one will mind. A great way to use up extra vegetables, particularly squash. These packets are definitely a friend in your cupboard.;positive
I have been ordering this for a year now and Amazon reminded me of reviews so I am writing this now.  I do the subscribe and save on this and I LOVE this honey.  The price can't be beat and the taste is of the more expensive brands at my local grocery store.  I drink hot tea daily and I couldn't do without this honey.  Rich, pure, sweet but not over powering.  Highly recommend.;positive
Delicious and fills you up.;positive
These logs with the chocolate on the inside and the licorice on the outside (cool concept) are terrific.  The tastes of the dark licorice and the luscious firm chocolate intertwine delectably. Mmm... will be ordering these again.  And probably again.  And again ...;positive
Love the stevia. Packaging sucks;positive
"This is delicious tea, and I drink it to maintain eye health. My mom, dad, and grandmother have all had different eye problems, and I want to do all I can to keep my eyes healthy. This is one way to do it!

Please be sure to open the individual packets carefully- you can tear open the tea bags if you're not careful.

There was initially a problem with my order, but Buddha Teas fixed it. I appreciate the good customer service!";positive
Good price in bulk;positive
I usually buy the Chocolate Peanut Butter Promax LS Bars, but decided to try out the Chocolate Mint ones instead. This version has less fiber than the Chocolate Peanut Butter, but also less calories and Sodium, which works for me.  The Chocolate Mint flavor isn't too strong or dominating. In fact, it's subtle and you barely notice it, thus there is no lingering after-taste or bitterness.  A big difference I noticed though were the bars themselves. This version has a bar that's more like a rectangle than the Chocolate Peanut Butter's rounded edges, and the bar is also pretty firm. When you bite into it, it's not hard enough to be difficult to chew, but it is a bit dry.  Still a high quality, healthy, low sugar protein & fiber bar with a good taste that won't dry out your mouth while eating it.;positive
"(ASIN: B001FA1DUU)  These are the greatest, and Cottie's mom has become addicted to them.  My taste buds don't know the diff between the Reese's and the hoity-toidy white chocolate, so I thoroughly enjoy them with abandon.  Am also underweight, which helps; don't have to worry about consumption.
Granted, I haven't searched beyond Chicagoland Jewel (Albertson's, SuperValu, ?) and Jewel doesn't have the Reese's white in any size.  Too bad for them, and too good for Amazon (Azon.)  Try them; they are simply delish.  No doubt you will find yourself scraping the remains off the paper cups they come in; that is how good they are.  My best to you.";positive
great source of Omgea's;positive
This is THE BEST Potato Chip money can buy! You can not get them in Large Grocery Stores only in specialty stores or restaurants! But now you can get them at AMAZON! YEAH! My wife flipped out when I surprised her with a bunch of her favorite stay fresh small bags of Miss Vicki's that she could not find at any Super Market! Now listen to me fellows, this is a great way to make your lady smile!;positive
I'm glad this comes in a two pack.  My wife and I have one bottle in the kitchen and one in the bathroom.  She uses it as a moisturizer after showering and I use it in my hair (I have black hair).  In the kitchen we use for cooking and flavoring.  I drop a dollop in my oatmeal in the morning (along with some hemp protein) to add some sweetness, but not too sweet.  I highly recommend this product.;positive
Nice to have and stay healthy;positive
"I have no doubt that this baking soda is all it is supposed to be.  I decided to go for this one over the traditional Arm and Hammer orange box that is cheaper in the stores.

I received a box that had no outer damage.  The inner box that the 4 packages came in had no dents but baking soda powder was leaking out of it.  I didn't pay too much attention to this until I opened the box to inspect the bags.  Two out of the four bags were open at the top and spilled all over.  Not just little leaks - but big ones due to the brittle plastic used in the bags.

I called Amazon and they are replacing the package.  Hopefully this was just a one time flaw but I could see an issue with the plastic used and the sealing method being an area of fatigue.  Messy - but right down the sink and in my garbage can.  As mentioned, no discernible damage to the box the package was shipped in and no damage to the outer package itself -- just the bags.

Update:  The package was replaced by Amazon and arrived next day.  I can't imagine the cost of shipping an add-on item FedEx but it shows Amazon's dedication to customer service.

I started this review out as 3 stars for the strange faux pas but have upgraded it to 5 stars.  The Baking soda is as expected.  The one difference I notice between this one and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Arm-Hammer-Baking-Soda-Pure-8-Ounces-Pack-of-6/dp/B00860VYYC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Arm & Hammer Baking Soda, Pure 8 Ounces (Pack of 6)</a>&nbsp;is that there are no clumps in this baking soda at all.  Perfectly fine powder.

I'm happy.";positive
One of my favorites. Low carb;positive
GOOD FLAVORS BUT A LITTLE SMALL!;positive
A quick, healthy, tasty pick me up.;positive
Living in the Midwest, 120 miles from any large metro area, we are unable to indulge our Sushi cravings as often as we'd like. These kind of fit the bill and are easy and portable. I bring along some pickled ginger, meat and veggies and this makes a substantial lunch.;positive
They arrived to me fresh!;positive
The plain and French Vanilla creamer actually stay smooth in tea and coffee and does not separate into tiny granules as many others do. Unfortunately I can't say the same for the Hazelnut flavor. Be sure to put it in the refrigerator before using, as the consistency is much better when it is cold. These little containers do not need to be refrigerated until opened, which is a huge advantage - you can buy quite a few and put them in the cupboard for use later. No sugar, no carragenen, no other bad stuff.;positive
Great product A+;positive
"I used to eat this soup for breakfast almost everyday in high school (when I wasn't eating this I was eating a hungry-man T.V. dinner.)

Do most people look at this soup and think breakfast time? Nope. But they're ignorant.

It used to be in a red can so I wasn't sure if I was buying the correct kind.

But, my craving was intense for this soup. So much so that I had to order this whole flat of cans.

And it seems to be the same delicious soup now as it was back then.

This is real Minestrone soup! With a capital ""MINE.""

I told my friend about this soup and his mom was pissed at me because now this is all he would eat in the way of soups (and it isn't exactly cheap as far as soup goes.)

It is worth every cent.

Thank you Mr. Puck.";positive
"I have the Keurig Brewer, with the 2.0 cups and I use the 2.0 individual cup and buy the filters. This is more economical, but to find a coffee that will not taste like water is difficult. This coffee does the trick although a little high in cost, I found it elsewhere for less; not the same brand, and still organic.";positive
This tea is absolutely delicious! Ive replaced one of my daily cups of coffee with a cup of this! Ive also iced it and added a package or two of Stevia and drink it on ice with meals in place of my Diet Pepsi which Ive had so much trouble quitting in the past. This is tea is AMAZING!;positive
I like many of the crema style T-discs also, but this is my every morning coffee.  For lack of a better description, good honest coffee flavor.  And usually one of the better T-disc values.  My first Saturday morning cup is one of these (stopped a little early) with a crema on top.;positive
My husband is a dentist whose high opinion of xylitol comes from much research he performed on a population with poor oral hygiene and an incidence of high tooth decay.  Children chewed 2 pieces of xylitol gum per day - one in the morning and one before going to bed.  (Too much xylitol causes stomach discomfort, so follow dosage directions.).  His dental team discovered a significant decrease in new tooth decay over time within the study group.  (Note that this product does not heal tooth decay but prevents future decay.). It's a natural, healthy product that won't cause any negative side effects unless you overdose.  It acts to change the pH of your mouth so that decay struggles to set in.  Our own children have used xylitol products since they were old enough to eat solid foods.  First we used mints and then progressed to gum.  Our kids chew two pieces of gum every night after teeth are brushed and before bedtime.  Today, they are ages 12 and 9 and neither of them has had a cavity yet.  Granted they are children of a dentist so good oral hygiene is a regular routine in our home, but I've watched them both brush and not floss their teeth - its pretty lacking.  Having an extra weapon in the fight to minimize tooth decay is a no brainer in my book.  We've tried many different brands but enjoy the flavors that Spry has to offer.  My kids love the fruit flavored, spearmint, and cinnamon gum.  We all love the lemon mints.  The peppermint flavored gum and mints (which I love) are a bit too spicy for our kids' tastes.  The 600 count container is well worth the money and a huge cost savings when compared to the smaller containers that we were flying through.  Spry is a great product!  We will continue to buy....indefinitely.;positive
Aromatic and Tasty;positive
"This product is fine. It tastes fresh. It is not very soft, but not hard, either.

The reason I did not give 5 stars is that it tasted too sweet for me. But then, the other ginger candies I tried were too sweet, too. So I guess I should not complain. In the past, I found a few ginger candioes that were not too sweet, but I can no longer find them. I guess most people like ginger candies to be very sweet.";positive
Tasty and great for a snack.;positive
My husband and I  love the candy coated sunflower seeds.  They make a great treat when you are craving something salty and sweet at the same time. We have shared some of ours with friends and they have since bought from this seller. They are well packaged, though I opened the bag and divided them up into gallon size and quart size bags for easier storage. They are delivered fresh and delicious.;positive
"I don't like to use the word ""waxy"" to describe the texture because that sounds terrible and these aren't bad at all - but its not an entirely unreasonable word to use.  I eat a little dark chocolate before bed nightly and these allow me to indulge without overloading.  Good value too, and the small portions help keep me from going crazy.  I think this is now a pantry staple for me.";positive
Nice for kids;positive
Very good! We really like these and toss 1/2 of a cube into a cup of hot water for a quick beverage. We also use these in the place of veggie broth when we're running low. These rock! Yes, they are salty and we looked for the low-salt ones, but couldn't find them - hence only 4 stars...;positive
too hot;positive
Delicious. Delicious. And Delicious. I've recently  been on a bit of a honey kick. I've been mixing hot water, organic honey, and organs lemon juice in the morning and its the first thing I put on my stomach. Normally when you add something healthy to your diet, you dread eating or drinking it. When I wake up in the morning, I can't wait to run downstairs and whip this concoction up. There was a little bit of crystallization when I first opened it, which is normal for it to be raw. But I haven't had any issued since. I'd order this again for sure.;positive
Love that there is no added sweetners to this peanut butter! I try to significantly limit the amount of sugars I consume, so a chunky (my favorite) peanut butter with only peanuts and salt was just what I was looking for. It does separate, and stirring the oil back in is sometimes difficult in the jar. However, the taste is 100% worth it!;positive
"Edited review, 10-26-2014
Personally, this is not to my taste. I have to thank the Dutch for making the COCOA that we all know and love. Before that, this was it. It says it has a satisfaction guarantee, however, Amazon says this product is not returnable. I contacted the seller and they immediately made a full refund. Before you buy this, read carefully and don't make my mistake: cAcAo is not cOcOa. I'm sorry, but now I know the difference. Apparently this is a popular product with many, it's just not for me.";positive
I got hooked over the holidays and the grocery stores don't carry them now because they say its a seasonal item.  There's nothing like cracking open some fresh walnuts yourself.  These nuts are FRESH and of high quality and reasonably priced. With Amazon Prime can't beat it overall.;positive
I don't think I could really face the night without my cup of Sleepytime vanilla. It signals to me that it's time to wind down, time to sip slowly, and enjoy the coming darkness. Love this stuff. I drink mine with unsweetened soy milk.;positive
"No complaints other than when my bag came, it wasn't properly sealed.  I thought the packaging seal would be air tight, but it wasn't.

Pops great, though I don't have any other products on hand to compare it to.  Way better than the crap you get in the bag.

I also ordered O'Dells Popcorn Supur-Kist Topping (Gallon) Non-Trans Fat, but I haven't received it yet.  Should be a great combo, I'm looking for the movie popcorn experience and it seems I'm close with this combo.";positive
These are the favorites, so far, of 3-4 kinds we've tried in our home Keurig.  These are easy to clean, and the hot water passes through them pretty well.  They are also reasonably rugged (but order a spare, they do wear out, and inevitably someone will throw one in the garbage when you're not looking).;positive
I just enjoy Lychee tea.;positive
"I bought the Nestle Hot Cocoa Mix, Rich Chocolate, 50 Count box and I am happy with it. I don't like strong hot chocolate so I use one packet and 18 ounces of water and I get a great tasting, low calorie and nearly caffeine free hot drink. I am a tea drinker but there are times when I want something different and this is it. My son says it doesn't taste like ""real chocolate"" but I think it does. It's a sweet hot treat and the price was great for so many packets. (Under $11 and then I saved 15% on Subscribe and Save.). It would probably be easier in my case to buy a tub so I could use as much or as little of the mix as I wanted but a packet works great for me with 18 ounces of hot water. I put it in my insulated mug and it stays hot for ages so there is no need to reheat if I don't drink it all quickly. My husband drinks this occasionally and he prefers it with warm/hot milk. I am not a dairy person but he says it is much richer with milk than water, It's a personal preference. Either way, this is a tasty hot drink on a cold day.";positive
"I just discovered by eating these that I had never tatsed a real  fresh almonds before. The tatse is out of this world, they are so flavorful, milky, tender. The only problem is the paper packaging, because there was a little tear on it . Terrasol should try and improve on all their packagings, but the quality of  their products is unparalleled. Hard to go back to average raw almonds after this.
Will always buy this so long that it's available to me.";positive
Very good. Taste great;positive
"Perfect for adding to soups, stews, stir fry and other dishes.  I reconstituted it somewhat by soaking in warm water then added all to my soups.
Convenient but still gives me some tomato taste and texture in my cooking.";positive
I was very wary of trying ghee.  It just sounded kind of weird to me but I bought it because all the articles and recipe books for the paleo diet said to use it.  Shortly after buying it, I found paleo muffins for sale at the farmers market.  I was so excited and couldn't wait to try them.  They were a little on the dry side.  Then I remembered I had that jar of ghee I had ordered sitting unopened in the cupboard and decided it was a good time to give it a try.  It was wonderful!  Not the tasteless thin oil I was expecting.  It was thick enough and had just the right amount of flavor.  Factor in the health benefits and there's no reason to go back to using regular butter ever again.;positive
puffed wheat cereal is a very healthy choice for cereal. it has no added sugar or salt. there is a good amount of fiber, little calories and carbs. filling and nutritous. recommed for health concious people. very good price through amazon;positive
Awesome deal and a huge container;positive
the barley and the 9-grain bread are my favorite. that's all I make at home. I bake one loaf every week. if you store it in the fridge, it's OK for about 3 days. After that I suggest you toast it or make French toast or bread pudding with it.;positive
These nuts live up to the description. They are fresh and tasty. I like that there is an unsalted option to use in breakfast yogurt parfaits. I've ordered a number of different nut products on Amazon and the quality of these are by far the best!;positive
"Pretty good, but sort of a hassle to do the caramel.  The popcorn is simple enough; you pop it as usual, but then you have to take out a huge caramel pouch, put that into the bag, and re-nuke it a wee bit, and hope that it spreads evenly...well...it doesn't.  Don't get me wrong, the caramel's delicious, and the popcorn's delicious...but there's no really easy good way to get the caramel to spread evenly, because the bag is too small and the caramel isn't really warmed up enough.  The caramel comes in a metallic bag so you can't just nuke that then pour it either.  :( ...too bad.

Overall, the flavors are good.  It's just inconvenient to try to piece together.  Sorta like the caramely part of moose-munch.

What I really miss is the caramel popcorn that I think ACT III used to make?  That caramel spread easily and came as a slab in the inside of the popcorn pouch itself, so that when you heated it, it heated the caramel too, so you don't get a solid huge lump.";positive
I love this soup.  We do fix as a soup for a couple of family members but I use mostly as sauces, or adding to recipes.  Especially the ones that call for cream of chicken soup.  Just adding the mushrooms adds a new flavor and even the mushroom hater in the house eats this in recipes (probably doesn't know it's there).  Hard to find at the my regular shopping stores.  Will continue to purchase.;positive
I really like this gum as it doesn't have aspartame! It has a really strong spearmint flavor, which lasts quite a while. It is really great for curbing food cravings when trying to diet.  It also works well for freshening your breath and making it smell like you just brushed your teeth! Plus it has the odd bonus of keeping my cat off the kitchen counter because all I have to do is open the bag and the cat sniffs it and runs far away...seriously, my cat hates this stuff! The company that makes this should look into making cat repellant to keep your cats from ruining your nice furniture and stealing your food off the kitchen counter.;positive
Great noodles for homemade Pho.;positive
My husband loves Utz Pub Mix.  We buy it in the larger size to save both money and time.  He takes a snack pack with him each time he golfs (X 4) during the week.  He also uses this mix instead of chips when he lunches at home.  Sometime I sneak a bite or two for myself.  Tastes great anytime you might want to have a pick me up.;positive
This is a great caffeine free tea.;positive
perfect for my grinder;positive
"This chocolate flavored stevia is delicious and is not at all plagued by the taste problems plain stevia often is.  It completely satisfies my desire for a Nesquick-type flavor.  I like it for two reasons.  1. It allows me to give my kids guilt-free chocolate milk.  2.  I can use it in almond milk for a delicious, low carb/low calories chocolate milk or hot chocolate.

Love it!  Just wish Amazon would bring back the two pack that was eligible for Subscribe n Save.";positive
Yum, and a good price.;positive
I love this gum, although the flavor does not last very long, it gets the job done and makes my teeth feel great. The flavor is amazing and it makes my breath fresh. I even started using xylitol as a sweetener in my coffee and other things because it is so great for your teeth and does not cause an insulin spike. Also, unlike other gums this gum does not have more than the necessary ingredients.;positive
I am just going through the first of the six pack I purchased from Amazon. I added two tablespooons of Country Quick Oats, raisins, walnuts and almonds and then half a glass of Soy milk to a bowl. Cooked it in a microwave for three mintues under reduced power, added honey and a touch more of soy milk for consistency. This has been the easiest breakfast to make. The taste and texture are very good. Amazon offers active subscription rates.;positive
Added to fruit salad;positive
Blends nicely when making frosting, hot/warm cocoa, and even smoothies - although if mixing this with cold beverages, it's best to mix with ones that have a higher fat content so that the cacao mixes in more effectively. Would purchase this brand again, and the reconfiguration of their ziptight pouch works more effectively than the previous incarnation.;positive
good juice, but a bit expensive...;positive
OMG SO DELICOUS!!;positive
"I had previously bought some other dry milk to add to my coffee, and getting it to dissolve correctly in my coffee was really difficult.  It would clump or sink to the bottom or not dissolve properly.  I was a bit worried about buying 3.5 pounds of a new milk I hadn't tried before.  But let me tell you, this milk powder is AWESOME.  It dissolves very well and tastes great.  I use it for cooking and for my coffee and it is wonderful not having to have fresh milk that will go bad quickly.  This stuff is the best dry milk I've had yet, and I've tried at least 5 different brands.

Este leche is muy bueno, usted debe comprarlo, o yo soy un mono.  I guess I'd better practice up on my Spanish.";positive
I make stir-fry meals often.  This oil makes it so quick and easy.  All you need is this oil, and a little soy sauce to spice up your stir-fried vegetables and meat, for a quick meal.  It also tastes great for rice or Chinese noodles.;positive
These are fresh and delicious.;positive
Very good-!!;positive
We like it except for the cost.;positive
This, the chicken version and the mushroom version are staples for me.  They live in the fridge after opened for about a year.  The stuff is the consistency of gum arabic but dissolves in hot water to make a great stock.  It adds a wonderful meaty flavor to soups, gravies, pasta sauces, etc.;positive
Puffed, flavored corn chips.;positive
"I'm new to the Gevalia brand... for Community has been my number one for several years.  They now have a contender!  :)

THe coffee is good.  Not sure what else to state.  It blows away the canned stuff in the stores and here on amazon with the free shipping, the price is as good or better than my local grocery store.  I just wish they had larger sized bags and had more selections of 1/2 calf or decalf.

This coffee, with the exception of the espresso flavored one... is now top 2 in my home.  Gevalia & Community Coffee.";positive
"Ceylon is the most healthy for of ""cinnamon"" - there are other types so do some research before purchasing ""cinnamon"" (Vietnamese cinnamon is a bastard variety for instance that can cause health problems).

Incidentally, Ceylon Cinnamon is absolutely tastes so much more wonderful that one almost wants to eat it by itself (organic recommended of course); can easily be used in place of sugar in many things and is recommended as a way to avoid blood-sugar spikes even when used with sugar, honey or other natural sweetener.";positive
I bought these for my husband for his birthday.  He said they tasted good, but he prefers something salty over these.  He is dutch so is used to extra salty licorice.  He still eats these but if you are looking for the salty licorice, then you might want to go another route.;positive
I love the flavor.  The only problem is that it makes such tiny puffs of corn -- we are accustomed to the larger popped corn.  However, we have learned that with the smaller popped corn, we can put a whole handful in our mouths at once!;positive
always great order all the time;positive
My friend's favorite.;positive
I LOVE this protein powder! I'm allergic to dairy, so I tried this as an alternative. It gives a mild vanilla flavor to my smoothies, and isn't very gritty at all compared to other powders that I've tried. I'm following the Trim Healthy Mama eating plan and use this in any recipes that call for protein powder.;positive
This instant herbal beverage blend is amazing. I wish I had discovered it sooner. It could almost replace my coffee addiction. Mixes well either hot or cold. Strong, but not too strong and not at all bitter. Great flavor.;positive
How can you go wrong?;positive
I recall eating a sandwich spread such as this when I was a child, so when I purchased the pack of six, I hoped that my family and guests would find it equally tasty. I was not disappointed and will probably share s jar or two with my fully grown children to put in their own pantries.;positive
It was good flavor.;positive
I consider myself a Chai tea snob and am constantly seeking new and better Chai teas. I love this Chai tea (one of the best I have had) - it reminds me of authentic Masala Chai that you get at Indian Restaurants. This tea is also very strong - I only find myself needing to use 1 teaspoon of loose tea per 8 ounces of water. The tea is excellent with honey and milk to create something a latte type drink.;positive
My son and I wanted to get each of his teachers a personal gift because of how much they have done for him over the years. We found out that one teacher really enjoys the taste of salted caramel creamers, but we could not find them. I put it in an Amazon search and this product came up. It is perfect, it's the all organic flavor without the cream so no refrigeration needed. All she has to do is add the flavor to her liking and at creamer separately. She loves is and that's the most important thing to us. We also told her where it came from so now she can buy it for herself whenever she wants it.;positive
"While searching for a new car to purchase, I inadvertently discovered this popcorn salt in the waiting area at the local Honda dealer. I went back three times - in part trying to discover why their popcorn tasted so wonderful.  I ended up buying a new 2014 Honda Accord. When the car was ready for delivery, I found their supply cabinet for the popcorn machine.

It was Mighty Popcorn salt and Canola Oil and bulk popcorn from Sam's Club. I ordered the top selling brand (Flavacol) here on Amazon thinking it would taste as good or even better, but it was simply awful tasting in my opinion.  Now I'll never change from Mighty Popcorn Salt.  I do wish they didn't use the artificial color - totally unnecessary. If I want a yellow color, I'll put butter on the popcorn. Fortunately I'm not allergic to aspirin (a side effect of this food coloring for some people).";positive
Great coffee from Caribou!;positive
I honestly don't care about gluten-free, gmo, etc, what I care about is that it tastes good. Granted an artisinal approach will usually make a better product, but that isn't always the case. I helped fund a kickstarter campaign for artisinal barrel aged sriracha that ended up being like a weak version of Tobasco. This stuff, however, is excellent. Really intense, deep flavor that works well in many applications. I'm sure it would horrify the Japanese that I use it with dashi in a ramen soup base and with soy braised ramen eggs, but it sure is delicious! As they say, it's concentrated, so it's a good idea to use it sparingly or cut with water. This makes a large bottle of it a good deal as it should last a lot longer than your regular Japanese or Chinese soy sauces. And yes, the bottle is drippy. I use a separate soy sauce dispenser for day to day use and keep the big bottle in the back of the fridge. Problem solved.;positive
"This stuff needs to come in quart or gallon paint cans!  Super good stuff. Not real hot on the 'scoville chili heat' scale, but a great mild to medium (as far as this old chilli head is concerned) but super addictively good, with great taste and awesome crunchy texture.

I suppose someone who doesn't really ever eat hot peppers would say this stuff is hot. But to me it's just the best stuff, I could put it in a bowl and eat it like soup. LOVE IT. Used up the whole jar in one weekend, putting it on everything.";positive
"These Ginger Chews are Awesome.
I think I'm addicted to them o)..
There easier to open if you keep them in the frig, it keeps them from sticking to the wrapping in the corners..
Anyway you eat them is still great.
I keep some in my purse, if I need a little pick me up, or feel queasy.
I notice they come from India..

I have not tried the other flavors, just the Ginger..";positive

I'd been buying dried figs from Costco for about a year, then saw these highly rated and decided to try them. So glad I did - they're much larger, plumper and fresher than the Costco product, and the price is competitive. Will keep buying these.;positive
I would give it 6 stars if I could. Taste is amazing, but everyone has different tastes. I tried Manuka Dr and Wedderspoon. Both taste fine, but this is less sweet which I like far better. This stuff is legit and not some fake brands like others out there so for me that justifies the price. I have scoliosis and I believe this helps with inflammation. I had spasms for years.  Big pharma pills helped, but Id rather not take any pills like most people just eat pills like candy. I went in with zero expectation, and was amazed to say the least. I have not taken any pain meds or muscle relaxors since. I cant say enough good about this product. Seriously!;positive
Thanks for your work. I like it.;positive
"They look so beautiful on a cupcake.
Paper  thin and very delicate but very easy to use.
Do make sure to order ahead of time as they will take a few days to arrive.  I got mine just in time and I'm so glad I did.  They really made the cupcake look special.

I mixed these in with a larger size and the combination looked beautiful.";positive
Great variety and good quality;positive
I love this and will buy more when I sell some stock! LOL Seriously, it is good stuff and such a lovey unique combination of flavors and spices. A treat for the senses. I do think that the granules are a bit large and too crunchy. And way too many chia seeds. I'd prefer pumpkin because they don't get stuck in my gums. Or maybe just some puffed rice or millet. Super yummy product. Sell some stock and buy some tomorrow. Just kidding. :) It is a good price with the walnuts and cherries in it.;positive
Excellent;positive
My dad loves this;positive
I've been using Quaker products just about as far back as I can remember. I mean since I as a kid and lemme tell ya, that's a looong time. As for the maple and brown sugar instant? Give it a try. It's really flavored just to my taste and dead easy to use.;positive
Best ginger tea. Really has power!;positive
Very good, will buy again;positive
I love these and like a previous review said, there's a lot of broken ones but there's no more broken ones in these jars than the ones I buy off of the store shelf. By the time I get to the bottom where the broken one's live it's time to buy a new jar any way. Also these are really fresh. I hope you keep selling them here. I'll buy from you and save gas, etc.;positive
Mmmmmmmmmmmmm..good!!  :);positive
"I love the Mild Palacio Chorizo. W use to buy it from La Tienda but lately Amazon is our primary place to buy them. This type of chorizo can be eaten ""raw"" in tapas (note that is a cured product), or it can be used in a variety of dishes, just use a bit of imagination. Finally, it is excellent to make a sandwich with a good crusty bread with manchego cheese !";positive
For some reason a lot of the stores around us stopped carrying Peanut Butter M&Ms. They're far and away the best M&M there is (get away from me with your Birthday Cake or Carrot Cake nonsense). These were on sale when I got them so I jumped at the chance to buy them.;positive
This tea is very delicious!;positive
"Fun, and I found them to be addictive. But I wish i could find the ones that have more bells and whistles - tiny silver balls and saffron etc. Quality-wise these are mediocre; they're just fun to eat but not the best I've had - far from it";positive
"This black garlic was delicious. Black garlic is not spicy as is regular garlic; it has an earthy, sweet, robust flavor. This product is reasonably priced if you want to try black garlic. I have seen it for a lot more money at the grocery store.";positive
Buying a box of my favorite candy bars (king sized, no less) should tell you all you need to know about how my New Years Resolution is going. Regardless, the box arrived right on time and was packaged and sealed well. No dings or scrapes that would make the candy unsuitable for sale or for gifting.;positive
I do love this stuff.  I try not to use any oil, betters etc when I cook and this turns out just wonderful using applesauce in place of the oil and only using half the amount they call for if you were to use oil.  The older mixes use to tell you to cut the oil amount in half and then use applesauce instead but the new boxes I have not seen that on.  I have also substituted the entire quantity of oil by using fat free greek yogurt and that turns out very fluffy and falls apart but everyone loved it too.  Totally recommend this mix to anyone.  I normally do not like mixes as I can taste an off taste in them that is somewhat metallic but not this one;positive
Yes! Loved them!;positive
Have been enjoying these candies.  I can't tell the flavors on a couple - 2 are very close in color (one is clear-ish, while the other is a very light yellow).  There are 5 colors/flavors and each is different from the others.  I took others' suggestions and went for the larger bag.  Glad I did!!  Will probably reorder when the weather is cooler because I'm not sure how they'll stand up to summer heat in a UPS truck.;positive
The one liter bottle is larger than it looks on the site.  This is an addictive dressing so the 3 bottles won't be around long! A much better value than in the grocery store where they sell a small 8 ounce bottle for over $5.00.  An excellent dressing to put out when company is over.  Many times this in the only dressing used!;positive
I had never had this and found it mentioned in a post on FB.  I asked what it was and was told it was a flavor enhancer that is used in Mexican cooking.  I bought this and had no idea how great it really is.  I love it and can't wait to be able to grill outside using this in my marinades or by itself.  It sure enhanced the flavor of my chicken dish I made.  Love it and it is a huge bottle, and you get 2!!!  Will buy this again.;positive
Beautiful big ginger paws. FRESH;positive
"I tried Nature's Path maple pecan a few times prior to buying this.
I must say I wasn't really flattered by the looks of this cereal but I love how it's not sweet!
It's filling and tastes more like a meal than sweet cereals.
If I feel like it, I could add fruits or mix a bit of other cereal for more sweet taste.

Overall, a healthier choice for breakfast.";positive
My favorite pod so far;positive
"I have bought several different flavors of honey, most of which I like, but the Tupelo honey is my very favorite!  It is sweet so I can use one teaspoon in my tea instead of two.  It comes in a glass jar, which I like, but some people prefer a plastic container with a ""spout.""  Aside from the delicious flavor, a major selling point for me is that this honey does not crystallize.  I spent too much time spooning instead of pouring with previous flavors. It is a bit on the expensive side, but worth it. Honey has increased in price in general because of the decline in the bee population. Highly recommended.";positive
"I was totally frustrated when the store we shop at quit carrying these in the bulk jars.  Amazon to the rescue!

I use these a lot in my cooking.  I don't add salt in whatever I add them too.  Just drop them in or pulverize them if I just want to add a dab.  Very versatile and I love the bulk packaging.  They just add a great flavor to so many foods!  Try them!  One in with your green beans along with some basil.  Ummm.  Thee perfect combination!";positive
I love this stuff. It's not great by comparison to an authentic Thai restaurant in the international district, but it's a good, cost-conscious at home alternative. I was glad to find it in a 6-pack, and will definitely order again. Be aware though, Prime Pantry doesn't guarantee a delivery date.;positive
This is an excellent product;positive
Taste like soy sauce.;positive
Taste Amazing! ;positive
Great variety for lunch snacks.;positive
Similar to Dunkin.;positive
"I cannot eat popcorn. I love popcorn. So what to do.... Pirate's booty satisfies my movie need to crunch. It tastes good. since it is ""white"" cheddar it has a buttery flavor thus satisfies my taste for popcorn as well. Yea me!
It obviously costs more than popcorn. However, my stomac, IBS, etc... is much happier and healthier with Pirate's Booty.";positive
This is the best deal I have found for coconut oil. I gave it to my daughter as a gift and she uses it for baking as well as mixing it with herbs like Lavender for face and skin. It is useful for many things and should be an essential in any home. Love it!;positive
If you're looking for something more natural than PB2 I would highly recommend Protein Plus. You can sweeten with stevia as it's not too sweet on its own, like PB2. Of course the protein punch is a bonus as well!;positive
"Sweet basil is a basic in my cooking.  I ordered this product and was amazed at the huge quantity I received (being used to smaller containers).  It is as fresh as drying your own home-grown basil.  Perhaps this is a life-time supply, haha.  It adds so much to fish, soups, just about anything if you are a sweet basil lover.  I give this product more than 5 stars; it is well packaged and promptly delivered.";positive
It was a wonderful assortment of healthy chips such as lentil,hummus,and pommegranite in a variety of flavors. They are low in sodium and contains between 130-140 calories per serving. They are gluten free and have no artificial  preservatives,colors,or flavors with simple ingredients that are simply delicious!;positive
best tea i've ever had!;positive
"I Love Hellmann's. It's tasty, creamy and very light tasting--plus it's not very fattening per tablespoon. Some mayonnaise can be very fattening, and I try to watch my caloric/fat intake, so I'm using more low-and non-fattening condiments such as mayonnaise, salad dressing and catchup. Try this and you'll LOVE it. You can barely tell that this is not the REAL thing. Will order again. Give it a try if you haven't.

Hellmann's is the 5-star, no guilt mayonnaise.";positive
This was good, although not as bold as I expected.  I like very bold, flavorful coffee, but this didn't seem much bolder than the regular Sumatra.  Would be good for anyone that doesn't like real strong coffee.;positive
These noodles are spicy, thick and filling. They've also got a wonderful smell that'll make everyone else in the house jealous. I don't know if these are authentic or not since I'm a white man, but given the very oriental packaging, I'd like to think they were authentic.;positive
"Smooth, even flavour, and consistent texture.  I used it for the first time today for a ""smoothie"" that I turned more into a paleo chocolate mousse.  I combined 2 heaping teaspoons with whole fat coconut milk (a few tablespoons) and about 1.5 cups of regular coconut milk, half an avocado, a teaspoon of Bourbon vanilla bean paste, a 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla bean powder, and of course, some frozen kale and a half scoop of Green Grass Amazing superfood. All organic, all paleo.  I add the green foods for nutritional value and consistency, but please be sure to note that even with what I used, nothing overpowered the cocao in the ""smoothie/mousse"" at all.  Great consistency after blended, wonderful taste.  May be sweetened with organic local raw honey.  I did not and the taste was rich.  I will not only repeat my recipe (which I totally guessed at!), but I will order this product again from this company.  As advertised.  Delivered promptly.  Arrived in tact and safe.  Comes in re-sealable bag.  Excellent.";positive
I really like this tea;positive
I love Good Earth Sweet and Spicy tea so I thought I'd try the other offerings. I found the Sweetly Twisted and Sweet Chai of Mine disappointing because they contain stevia, so they are too artificially sweet for me. But I still love the caffeine free Sweet and Spicy!;positive
yummu;positive
great in my smoothies!;positive
Awesomely tasty and gluten-free!;positive
Each morning I brew a cup of this coffee with a vanilla creamer for my wife of 38 years. I wouldn't drink it ( I like very strong COFFEE) but she finds it just the thing to jump start her in the AM. That is why the world has diffferences.;positive
Great flavor.  Mixes well.;positive
"Bought this for my mom for her birthday, along with a book (Chicken Soup For The Tea Lover's Soul) and a tea cup and saucer. My mom loves a cup of tea either in the afternoon or after dinner, and she likes to have a selection. This set comes as two complete tins. My mom also hosts dinners frequently at her house, and this will look lovely as she offers a selection to her guests.
I actually ordered a membership for myself. I've received the first shipment--Amazon provides amazing fast shipping--with the next shipment following in six months. If you've prices tea bag tea at the grocery store, you know the prices have climbed for good quality teas. Yes, you can (and I have) get boxes of tea from the dollar store. Sometimes you get what you pay for.
Serious tea lovers will find this very impressive and giftable. The tins are also reusable.";positive
This is, hands down, the best pancake mix I have ever had. Frankly it's even better than my homemade pancakes (shhh... don't tell anyone!) After we had this the first time I bought a box for my mom, daughter and best friend. It's a permanent pantry staple now. It's terrific made according to the instructions, but extra rich and awesome if you use milk and add vanilla and egg. I also make it sometimes with a pinch of baking soda and some lemon juice, for extra fluffy pancakes.;positive
Bunch of crunchy dried sour whole cherries. Delicious. I left the canister sitting on the end table, came back, husband had eaten half of it... Perfect, not too sweet. Don't recommend eating half a canister at once, though. His tummy was as unhappy as if he'd eaten a bunch of green apples from the fruit acid. :D;positive
"The unsalted nuts are always a bit pricey (..you pay more for NOT having salt added ?!?!) but are a great mixer for the salted stuff !!

I highly recommend them, and are a great snack for late night or just watching the ball game ...";positive
"I have been on a strict diet since May. Although quite successful, I miss having a winter, hot cocoa ""hit"". I gave this a try and I think it's wonderful!

The taste is rich, even though I use water and not milk to mix. I also use 8 oz. of water, as the package recommends, NOT 6 and it isn't too diluted, at all. I like the darker chocolate flavoring and throw a few miniature marshmallows on top for an extra treat. Best of all, this cocoa is over 99% caffeine free so you can have it late and it won't prevent a sound night's sleep. No funny aftertaste, either. This is a genuine delight.";positive
I bought some at Publix and when I ran out they didn't carry it anymore.  So I decided to check Amazon and was very pleased to find here.  I put it on bread and meat and salads.  It's not just for dipping.  I highly recommend this product.  It is a staple at my house.;positive
"I love the African one best, it smells so good, sweet, but not taste sweet, not bitter too. Also the Chai was great too! My friend comes from India and he drink tea everyday, he said it's perfect taste!
I love the mint tea too!";positive
"Amazing taste and amazing price with Subscription!

(Insider secret!!!!!!!!!  I have found through trial and error that these k-cups can be used twice.  The first cup is regular and if you run a second cup through, you can even get a second fairly decent cup of coffee again!  A little on the weaker side but that is fine with me if I can cut the cost of a k-cup in HALF by using it twice!)";positive
Perfect for my Chili Recipies;positive
"I love ""Nows"" Organic Extra Virgin Macadamia Nut Oil.  It has a very rich buttery taste that is a wonderful replacement for those of you who can't have Butter, because of Casein Sensitivities, which I do. I have been using Nows"" Organic Extra Virgin Macadamia Nut Oil for over several years now, it is great in salads, and on vegetables. It also fries at a higher heat than most Oils, and can be used in baking, which I have used for most of my Low carb muffins. I love this Oil, and have no plans to change it in the future, unless another Company comes out with a better product at a better price.  So far that has not happened, and I have tried many different brands.";positive
I many flavors of  Sweet Leaf stevia and have liked them all. This flavor is great for coffee, smoothies and for making homemade ice cream - all without having to use sugar, which is not good for many especially with Diabetes.;positive
I bought these to try to get my girls to eat them instead of sugary junk food.  To set a good example I ate one first.  wow!  My girls never got a chance to try them.  I blew through them 2/day.  they are great the way the are, or add some parmesan after you cook them and they are even better!  I had to increase the cooking time to 1 minute to get them hot.  My new order is for 2 double sized and 2 single sized (still hoping my girls will try them);positive
Not sure if this is concentrated or what. When I made my initial paste, it came out extra thick and concentrated. Since I've only started making curry I could only judge how much to dilute it by what I've eaten in the past. The good news, I diluted with water and coconut cream and the results were fantastic. I'm not saying that because I tasted it but my neighbors, who are not curry eaters, are now asking me when I'll be making my curry again.;positive
excellent flavor;positive
Potent flavor;positive
Probably more like 3 1/2 stars.  Good variety pack if you are looking for more than just coffee, but could be better.  My main complaint is that the coffee choices are boring - wish they had thrown in flavored varieties instead of plain coffee from different brands.  Oh well, at least they give you some good cappuccino choices, otherwise I would only give 3 stars.  I suppose it would be better just to make my own pack as I would have chosen more tea flavors as well instead of a bunch of cocoa & cider.  I don't think I would buy this particular variety set again.;positive
"There are not many to compare, so 4 stars for now.
I gave up buying a packed factory shaven bonito.
I eat heap of shaving over a salad so the packed one is too expensive for me.
Carpentry plane works fine with some effort.
I am going to make simple box to stabilize the plane.";positive
Awesome product was very pleased;positive
"This tea is most delicious.  I am pleased with the fine quality and good price.  I've seen other jasmine blossom teas that include ""natural jasmine flavor""--what ever THAT is.  THIS tea is tea and jasmine blossoms, period.  I think I'll go brew a pot of this tea right now!";positive
"V8 Fusion is great. Servings of vegetables in a drink that tastes great is a fantastic invention. (peach-mango is by far my favorite flavor)

The price here on amazon is either very good at times, or leaving a lot to be desired. You can pick up single bottles at a grocery store or a target/walmart for around $3 a bottle, or maybe less if they're on sale. On amazon, (I'm a subscribe & saver) the price seems to change a lot, anywhere from shipments that were in the low $2, to the higher $3's and $4's.

In short, a great tasting drink with nutritional value, but watch the prices to make sure you're not paying too much.";positive
Fresh and great value!;positive
taste excellent;positive
"Its loose, can add in dispenser to your pot or your cup.  I just don't like them every time I have tea.  Get tired of fennel after a while.  The taste is not overwhelming though.  I find there is nothing like going back to plain ole' black tea with honey.  But this is a good choice when you don't want ''bags""";positive
Almost perfect;positive
Bought as a gift and delivered several states away.  Excellent reports from all who tried it.  Only negative was one of the boys was reluctant to try mushroom flavored popcorn but soon dug in after it was explained that it refers to the shape of the popped kernel.  Reports were that they were tasty and mushroom shaped and fun to eat.  A bit expensive for popcorn but made a good gift.;positive
My go-to brown sugar for baking, love that it is organic and always reliable.  Amazon has a good price, also buy sometimes at whole foods.  Good quality, moist and easy to work with, my baked goods always taste great with this sugar.;positive
Omg - best ever;positive
Tastes great, and not heavy.;positive
Wonderful for homemade spice mixes.;positive
I have been drinking this tea for over a month now and I absolutely love it.  It tastes a little sweet and a little bitter at the same time.  Much better than the hibiscus tea I used to drink that was in a bag.  This tea is so much better and much fresher.  The price for how much you get is also a bonus.  I will definitely be purchasing this again.;positive
Good nutmeg, even flavor;positive
We have a new addiction and it's SunButter.  It's not as heavy as peanut butter and much better for you.  I love the taste.  We dab it on pieces of celery for a healthy snack for throw a spoonful of it in our smoothies in the morning.  It's not as high in calories as peanut butter and seed are better for an anti-inflammatory boost.  We tried it at a special needs camp where we have to be aware of peanut allergies and SunButter filled the bill.  Once we tried it, we don't even want to go back to peanut butter.  It's a great bargain on Amazon too.  Thanks for a great product!;positive
I have had these crackers several times throughout the years.  I bought them from amazon.com because they offered them in bulk.  I didn't realize that the bags were full size bags.  It's not a terrible thing, it just means that I have more to eat.  I like the way the taste is subtle and not cheapened with strong artificial tastes.  I can see where some people may be coming from with saying they're bland, but I think that they definitely have a taste and it's a good taste at that.  It does take eating a few crackers before you really get the full effects of the taste.  I would probably say that people should order these if they really like them or often host parties or whatnot where people will consume them.  Otherwise, it's a lot for a single person.  That's not really a bad thing, but it is something to be aware of.;positive
I'm addicted to this flavor sauce.  It's handy to use over pasta, in tortilla stuffers, as well as chicken sauce.  The marshals flavor is a little mild for me - nothing is ever as good as home made or restaurant quality - but it's good.;positive
These are excellent! ;positive
Shangri-La is my go-to tea when the weather gets warm and the new Passion Berry did not disappoint! I like my iced tea on the fruity, flavorful side, and not sweet, so this works perfectly for me. Easy to make, I just keep it in the fridge for a quick cold sugar-free drink.;positive
not big on the cinnamon;positive
These applesauce pouches are a great-tasting, healthy, easy snack for kids! I really like the new lid design, as well - the kids like to try to fly them, and they feel safer to me somehow than the ventilated round lids.;positive
Such noodles. Many yum. Wow.;positive
Fast and they're good peanut;positive
By far my favorite butter;positive
"Just got my Mallomars and I am thrilled. Can't find them in the store in MN. They are just like I had as a child in NY. The price is high but not outrageous.

Best cookies in the world. Will celebrate the new year by eating a box of Mallomars with a big glass of cold milk.

Life doesn't get better than that.";positive
good dates;positive
you get a ton of steel cut oatmeal for the price but it is one step below the best brand (I forget the name but it is something like Oak Mill).  This is what I would purchase if I was buying for the whole family.;positive
Fun and tasty stocking stuffers.;positive
I bought this on a whim after some sporadic experience with an old, trusted roaster....  This is a very nice new taste for me.  It's a bit lighter roast than the two espresso roasts that I have been using.  It's got a nice, delicate taste that asks to be made on the strong side to show its best character.  I haven't bought ground coffee in many years, so this whole experience was a bit of a lark for me but I'm glad I tried it.  I'm using in a LaPavoni machine and a Moka rig and they're both working well with the grind as arrived.;positive
These are excellent oats!;positive
This is my absolute favorite tea...morning, noon or night...usually night. It is difficult to find in the states and have purchased other items from this seller. Packaged safely and quicker arrive time than stated. I will be purchasing again.;positive
Love the taste.  We mix it with seltzer, so it's like a fizzy cherry pie taste.  It's very refreshing.  I was hoping to get the inflammation reduction that a lot of people reported.  If I did, it wasn't that I could notice it. I had to stop using it on a regular basis because it was negatively affecting my fasting glucose.  I will have it as a treat now and then and time it a little better in the day because I do like it, and as a treat goes at least it's a healthy treat.;positive
"(B000E123N2) et.alles.  I really am hooked on this product line, despite reading other reviews that say thus-and-such doesn't taste like the restaurant versions.  I don't get out much, so I will never have that experience to spoil my own enjoyment.  I also read a complaint about the noodles.  Well, they are vacuum sealed, and depending on the noodle, might retain their natural noodle aroma, but that is all.  Anything else said is bunkum.
I would suggest that the packets of dehydrated spices, and blocks of goodies that comes with Tom Yum, for instance, be heated in a minimal amount of water first, and then covered with the noodles.  This will allow the spices to rehydrate in the best way possible, and makes the product tastier.
These are not inexpensive; once you find the ones you like, order them through 'Subscribe and Save' for the extra savings.  You can stagger their delivery so you get one a month.
And by all means, ENJOY !";positive
Exactly as described and delicious;positive
"By far the best dates Ive had. I love to use them mostly in nice cream smoothies with bananas, non-dairy milk and almond butter. Using the dates takes away any need for honey or even vanilla.
Highly recommend.";positive
"I ordered this soup and although I gave it 5 stars, the soup was kind of ""skimpy."" I've heated this product on the stove in a pot and it contained more ingredients than in the Microwave bowl, Yet I still had to give this product a 5-star rating because Campbell's has that familiar and delicious taste that I loved when eating it as a child.";positive
They are gluten free and Delicious!;positive
"I absolutely love this cocoa. The flavor is deep and rich, and it is very low calorie when used to make healthy, chocolate ice cream. It also tastes great in chocolate baked goods, and I mix it into plain, unflavored protein powder as well, sweetening it with stevia.

The one-pound bulk bag is perfect for me, because I use a lot of this cocoa. It is organic, fair trade, and Kosher. It is processed with alkali and non-irradiated.

I will continue purchasing this product.";positive
"Package was delivered in the desired time and was well packaged. My whole family prefers this brand, as a matter of fact we usually purchase it whenever we ""go home"" to visit. It just so happened we ran out and was very happy to find it on line. It becomes easier to purchase this or any of the other types of this brand e.g. the one for use when cooking goat. I did do an earlier review of this product, but I am not sure why it did not post, maybe my description was not adequate. My family loves this brand whenever we feel like having a curry dish because it is so delicious. Thanks.";positive
My husband and I are crazy about these mints! They are fabulous and love that they are organic and so much goes into making sure they are a healthy version of mints/candies. Very strong and don't leave you with bad sugar breathe afterwards like some sugar mints do. We have gone through multiple bags in the past 3 months & reordered.;positive
fabulous aroma & tasty too!;positive
Perfect blend of sweet and savory. Just enough of each ingredient. I don't know what other reviewers mean by peppery or spicy? It really had only the flavors described, chicken, cranberry, apple, celery.... no pepper or spices. Small amount though for the packaging. Was filled about 1/2 way instead of full.;positive
great product, we love it;positive
Love Jasmine tea.  This was good!;positive
Best boxed Mac N Cheese so far.;positive
I am very particular about how my coffee tastes in the morning so I'm not going to add anything that doesn't either leave it be, or enhance the flavor. This falls in the arena of enhancement. I find I use a little less sugar with it, and the slight molasses flavor gives my coffee a very very slight mellowness to take off the bold edge. (I like my coffee very bold.) I keep a box at work and at home. While I can get Sugar in the Raw loose, I like the serving size of two packets as the perfect serving with my Nespresso at home, and one with my Keurig at work. It's much easier because I don't have to think before I've had my coffee.;positive
"my kid is obsessed with potato chips. i am probably going to switch to non GMO brand, hoping Lays will grown a conscience and go that route too. yes I know you're probably snickering and saying to yourself ""wishful thinking"" but hey...positive thoughts go a long way, and crazier things have happened. meanwhile I could not give this life saver box a lesser rating because of how timely and convenient it has served my family of 7 and they're snacking needs.";positive
works well in gluten free flour.;positive
These are great. We can sometimes find these locally, but not reliably. We also needed salam leaves, galangal, candlenuts and a few other things to make Balinese chicken spice, and we found them all at Amazon. These arrived in good shape with two day shipping. They are plant roots from a warm country, so they handled a couple of days without refrigeration with no problems.;positive
Everyone has their favorite coffee brands and this is mine. Also like Yuban Gold and Seattle's Best. But this is my favorite as it most like espresso from a coffee chain. I use it in an Italian Bialetti, drip, or press. Works for all three.;positive
This is hands down the best water available from a bottle. Too bad they don't come in glass bottles. The program is a great deal considering they cost much more in the store. All other water from bottles are purified and treated in some way. I will only drink Fiji, Evian, and Pellagrino;positive
I was introduced to black garlic a few years ago and have been in love with it since! It has this wonderful balsamic like taste to it, but can be bold yet delicate in a way. This brand in particular is sweeter than the Korean and Chinese brands I have tried, but I do like that it is made from American grown garlic and fermented in the USA. It pairs wonderfully with so many things from steak to seafood, and salads to cheeses. I paired mine with some mild goat cheese and it was spectacular. Sorry the plating isn't better, this was a mid study snack and sure hit the spot! Also pictured is the jar opened after it had been attacked and quite a few consumed. You can see the natural colour variance in the fermentation process, but they all taste great and amazing! If you like black garlic you so need to try this brand!;positive
"It doesn't have an overwhelming garlic smell or taste except when eating one of the several cloves baked into this loaf.  It is almost like the ""take and bake"" loaf from La Brea.  However, I don't consider it a minus.  If I want a strong garlic flavor I can easily grind up fresh garlic cloves before adding olive oil and dipping the bread into the mix.

It is substantial and satisfying.  The shell is not too hard to chew but protests the moist inner.  The inside has substance, too, not airy as if I was eating air.

Overall, a good loaf of almost artisanal bread at a reasonable price (only a few cents more than a similar loaf sold at Trader Joe's).  I will definitely buy again.";positive
This is my husband's favorite hot sauce, and it's Fantastic that we can now buy this from Amazon, and on Prime! Can't find it in the stores on the East Coast. It's a tad bit thicker than others, and has a bit of chunkiness. Tangy, but not scorching hot. Love it.;positive
I first had Speculoos in Belgium in the Grand Place, years ago when visiting.  They would give you one with your coffee at all the outside restaurants.  I had my daughter with me and they waiters would all come round and give her a Speculoo cookie so we'd end up with quite a few.  They are delicious, so crispy and have a taste I've never quite tasted before, though the nearest has to be Biscoff cookies.  To be able to get actual Speculoos from Amazon has made me so happy and brought back so many fond memories of Brussels.;positive
"For a guy who doesn't cook this rice was the easiest thing I've ever made that turned out right. It's flavorful and wonderful for your body as well. I purchased six packages of this and will use it as a side often. (Well, as long as I am on this cooking thing......)  ;-)";positive
This is my fav treat. I'm glad it is on Amazon. I do wish there were more bags for the price, and who knows, maybe they will add it later. I enjoy this treat all the time. Unfortunately, it only lasted one day in my home.;positive
"Flavorless, slightly bitter. I prefer Community Half Caf full smooth no, no, no bitterness.

UPDATE: after one month of drinking this coffee I have changed my mind to really liking this coffee. I did change the grind to a  bit more coarse grind and what a difference. No bitterness and very smooth and flavorful. I still like the Community brand as well so it is great to have two half caffs! hmm... do two half caffs make a whole caff?";positive
GOOD;positive
Execellent product!;positive
"I read on a yahoo news article the benefits of Rooibos tea so I decided to give a try. (I tried to find the article to link to here, but was unable to because it was a while ago.) I have never been to South Africa so I can't speak on the authenticity of it, but it does taste delicious. It is sweet enough that I do not need to add anything too it.

The sellers of this tea also sent me an email with the benefits. I have only had a couple cups so I can't speak from that much experience, but I do find it relaxing.";positive
Worth the price, great taste;positive
I've tried other brands in the past and decided to actually do some research this time around and found this particular brand, I just got it(super fast shipping btw) and the flavor is amazing, the last one i bought was Manuka Doctor and I  still have it in my pantry and boy it doesn't even come close flavor wise.;positive
Not as good as Saigon Cinnamon. I stopped using the Saigon because of the liver issue concerns associated with using large amounts.  It is good, but basically I use it now for no other reason than the health benefits.;positive
Love these mallow treats;positive
"It's delicious; naturally sweet, I think, but then all the time, I take my herbal tea without any sweetener.  The health benefits of rishi and ginger have been well documented, so they don't have to be recounted here.  It is soothing to my self, and I believe it helps with my digestion, stomach, and throat.  I have esophageal ulcers, which are soothed, not irritated by this tea.";positive
Arrived in a timely manner with quality as expected. This coffee is so yummy. In a Kureg 2 try it on the strong setting. You can even put it thru once on 10 oz and again at 4 oz for a bigger cup on one pod. Look forward to it every morning. Excellent product. Thanks very much.;positive
"I am so sad that these are no longer being sold.  They were the most convenient for making mixed cocktails at my house when entertaining guests.  These are smaller than a regular can of soda, so there weren't constantly 300 half used open cans at the end of the night which was great and it really cut down on my recycling.  The quality of Hansen's is great.  I've had many different kinds of their sodas, and they have all been excellent.  I hope these come back in stock at some point because they were a great price and a staple in my household for sure.

I recommend any of their products but these are by far my favorite.";positive
"As a bona fide ginger freak, this is one of the very best gingers I have tasted and I love it. Since ginger can settle an upset stomach, I can take a swig of this very potent ginger flavor without the bother of carbonation and feel better quickly. Could be psychosomatic but if it works.......
A very excellent and true ginger flavor";positive
Such a good deal!  And OMG these are all SO GOOD!!  We love these and when we want a sweet treat after eating these work well without all the calories!  You can't go wrong with these, great for all ages and healthier then most candy!;positive
I have used this mustard see to make homemade Dijon mustard, and it better than any mustard you can buy. Making your own mustard is really so easy, and you know what is going into it. This is a link to my recipe for homemade Dijon mustard. http://allrecipes.com/personalrecipe/63594299/homemade-dijon-mustard/detail.aspx;positive
i had never tried chickpeas before, they really are crunchy.  hard crunchy.  i feel like i'm going to break a tooth when i'm eating them.  i tried this one and another flavor.  the flavor is good, but only lasts about two seconds, then it's just dry chickpeas.  i ended up giving them to friends when i had people over, every kind of agreed that their too hard and the flavor is good, but doesn't last.;positive
I have found this to be a necessity when making certain dishes like vegan lentil loaf.  It gives an extra amount of body along with whatever starch you use to thicken the mix.  Thank you Amazon for carrying this goody.;positive
Only use it in our smoothies.  We are not health nuts, but try to make good choices.  We still like to have sweet tasting fruity smoothies, and this adds some potentially positive benefits without seriously harming the taste of our smoothies.;positive
I love these cookies!  They have the texture of parmesan cheese crackers- sort of like shortbread, but with more texture- and the taste is wonderful (for some reason they remind me a lot of McVitie's digestive biscuits- it must be the texture).  I love that they are not too sweet.  I eat them with goat cheese.  These are pretty, and delicious, and it's wonderful to be able to get diverse grains in to my diet in such a painless and delicious way.;positive
delicious and soft!;positive
Great tasting alternative to regular coffee that I have been drinking in copious amounts for the past 15 years. Doc told me to cut back on my caffeine intake, no more 10 cups a day for me but said two to three of regular coffee would be ok and when asked if I could drink caffeine free to replace my normal intake she said that would be ok. After some searching I decided to give this stuff a go and glad I did. Has a great taste and although the can is pretty small I use less of this to achieve the strength in flavor that I like.;positive
"Purchased for holiday traditional meal;  potatoes, cabbage and anchovies.  Fry the anchovies till nice and crispy and break into pieces over the taters and cabbage.  Wonderful.  Nice size around 4 inches.  Packed well in salt.  Just store in sealed container in frig and will last months.  These are the next best thing to fresh from the sea which are very hard to come by.";positive
These are very high-quality cooking tomatoes, fresh and packed with tomato flavor.  When I make curries, I use tomato paste for thickness, but then really enjoy adding a can of these for both flavor and texture.  They've never let me down yet!;positive
Best Refried Beans ever.;positive
Proper and satisfying.;positive
"Remember this from childhood days. . . . and believe me I ""ain't young"".  Cannot find it in the stores in my neck of the woods and I have asked them to stock.  Highly recommend to have on hand for friends stopping by unexpectedly for coffee.";positive
I buy these often, I eat daily. I add 2-3 tablespoons in my morning 16oz water & drink.  The last 2 orders they have come in two 1lb bags which works great for me!  I put 1 in freezer & 1 in fridge.  Works really well!  Great quality & I've bought this brand for at least 6 mos or more now.;positive
Use them up fast;positive
Wow, the combination of  hard apple flavored cande pop covered with a partial coating of carmel is a wonderful treat. These pops are a mouthful of spring and summer. The green apple tartness melts with the sweetness of the firm caremel. These two flavers blend into a real treat. I will order more.;positive
Bought this for my wife for valentines.  I finally made a correct choice.  She loves them.  These chocolates are very good, wrapped wonderfully, and don't last long.  For me, however, this brand is just a tad short of Ice Cubes chocolates, but that is not a negative.;positive
Delicious! However, a lot of the salt fell off, and there was an inordinate amount of breakage. So, I'm being generous here with my five stars. I'd rather pay an extra dollar and have these delicious pretzels properly shipped to me.;positive
they were good and fresh;positive
"I want to make cauldron cakes from Harry Potter and I wanted green bubbles, so I needed green sugar pearls. I tried going to my local WalMart, to a craft store, to a grocery store and no place had green in stock. It drove me crazy and WASTED GAS. So while this bottle may be a bit pricey, at least I was able to get the color I wanted.

I haven't made the cakes yet, but they're a good color for what I'm looking for. I opened the bottle and took one out and ate it just to see how it was. It was just like a big sprinkle and was not too hard, which was what I was afraid of. All around I'm pretty happy. I've seen these used on very elegant cake pops and they look amazing.";positive
Worked well for making mead;positive
This is the second package of Organic cashews (yes, it is labeled organic) I've purchased from this seller and have been very happy with the product.  I make cashew milk and it has a fresh taste to it.  The only issue I have with the most recent purchase is that the cashews were mostly broken up.  I'm not positive it's the seller's fault so will not ding them a star for it.  It could've been the shipping handler.;positive
Before buying my Keurig brewer, I never really like black tea.  I would drink herbal tea from tme to time but black tea always seemed too bitter.  After trying Celestial Seasonings English Breakfast Tea, I was instantly converted.  There is no bitter taste and it's so much less acidic than coffee and therefore much easier on my stomach.  It has a mild, slightly fruity taste that is perfect with breakfast or really anytime of day.  I've tried it plain and with a bit of milk and sugar as well.  I honestly have become more of a tea drinker than coffee drinker since trying this delicious tea.;positive
Finally, a really good substitute for brown sugar! I've only used it in three recipes so far, but it tastes great. The really good recipe was for Carolina Pulled Pork, and the accompanying vinegar barbecue sauce. Splenda's idea for brown sugar is to use their sweetener along with sugar-free maple syrup. Doesn't sound like brown sugar to me. This really does taste like brown sugar, though. It's not moist and clumpy like brown sugar, but the taste is there, and that's what counts.;positive
"Excellent curry powder with a fair retail value.

I used this mainly to make my husband's favorite dish: vegetable coconut curry.  I use enough curry that purchasing it in the store by individual bottles becomes too expensive, but even this, very large, one pound bag, has lasted me 2 years so far.  The taste is still fresh.  I emptied the contents into glass canning jars, with plastic screw lids to preserve freshness.  The jars are then kept in a cool environment.

I have purchased a couple of spices by thus brand so far and have nothing ill to say about the brand or this particular spice.  I could easily recommend it.";positive
This is an easy way to get a boost of vitamin B. The flavor is really nice, and it's not sweetened with sugar or aspartame. All of these things are really great. The only problem is the flavor disappears really fast. Especially for a sugar-free gum. I find I chew this for maybe 5 minutes or less and it's completely devoid of flavor.;positive
"If you like mild flavored, crunchy snacks that will go with any topping, you will like these crackers.  They are delicious alone, super with soups and quite nice with any topping.

I highly recommend these and other gluten free Crunchmaster crackers!";positive

This is great.;positive
"This is one of my favorite Tea K-Cups. The quality is EXCELLENT!  Most decaf teas sort of get lost in the translation, but TWININGS have manage to get this one right.  A great BREW at 6 or 8 oz. cup (do not go to 10-12 oz.)...you'll lose to much of the FLAVOR!
I will purchase this again, but I'll have to get it directly from Keurig...since I ""joined"" their auto ship program. I'll be saving 20% on each 28-Ct. box ($12.00) PLUS they offer FREE SHIPPING!

But, when I'm no longer in the Keurig Club...it's wonderful to know that AMAZON.COM offers a ""fair"" Price!!!";positive
Great gift box, well received.!!!!;positive
Delicious....;positive
Best tasting mac nuts, too pricey!;positive
"First of all, my review is probably biased to begin with because Illy is one of my favorite coffee brands. This is my second purchase after having tried this and another of its competitors' pods and I decided to come back to this. If you own a delonghi espresso machine like I do, then you are probably in the same boat as I was when first faced with the E.S.E. pods availability when I got too lazy occasionally for a freshly pressed brew. Here's a short summary of what I have found...

Quality...good taste comparable to the fresh grinds. Noteworthy to say that Illy is the originator of the E.S.E. standard, so it is probably safe to say that they know what they are doing. There is no K cup business here. These people are serious about their coffee and so are their consumers. If you own an espresso machine that has this option, you are probably already a coffee purist and snob like I am so a medium and dark roast is pretty much a basic daily brew ( no funny hazelnut coffee here..)

Availability and value...the K cup wave is big in the US but not so in the rest of the world. This makes it rather difficult to get these pods in the supermarkets or hyper.markets like Target, etc. if anyone could help me out on this one, this is the cheapest I could find on Amazon at <$1/pod. Delivery is standard and typical of postal services in the absence of fulfillment by Amazon.

Gifting...this is also my second purchase for a gift. If you, like me, have a friend who had just purchased an espresso machine (Delonghi, for one) that uses the E.S.E pods, this is indeed a value pack from one of  the traditional Italian masters that cannot go wrong. The medium roast is accepted by most and a darker roast can be easily manipulated with their machines if one find it too strong a brew.

Environmentally friendly? ...unfortunately, these pods are packaged separately for freshness. The foil packaging may be recyclable in some states. The pods are wrapped in paper and easily torn once they have been used. One can then take oit the grinds and use them for gardening purposes.

Enjoy!";positive
I could wish all the k-cups were cheaper, but I just can't resist the convenience. These are tasty, and sometimes I add a little extra to it for enhancement--milk, half and half, marshmallows, chocolate curls...but the basic product is my go-to now that it is cold outside.;positive
JUST WHAT I EXPECTED;positive
Love this for our super shakes;positive
good value.;positive
great product and shipping;positive
This box of Mac and Cheese is not like Annie's regular stuff. Instead of the tasty cheese powder that you make into sauce, it has a pre-made fake cheese sauce. I found the flavor overwhelming on its own, but I mixed some steamed broccoli in and it was delicious.;positive
Yummy, yummy, yummy!  Wee little German chocolates that are so rich and delicious that you only need one at a time.  American chocolate is so...so...so very waxy and, of course, candy bars are huge.  German chocolate is made with love and care and surprise, no wax, so you only need one small piece to satisfy your chocolate cravings.  Go on and treat yourself to real chocolate!;positive
The flavor of this tea is nutty with mint, not grassy. The way they keep the price down is that its 3rd grade or smaller tea pieces. The price breaks on the grade are significant while the flavor varies little. The organic version is much cleaner than some of the other reviews indicate. Its become a daily tea for me and I'll buy it again. Enjoy.;positive
Love this coffee.  I can drink two cups (as I like to do in the morning) and not get an upset stomach. I think it's less acid as another rewiewer said. I use this coffee, Stevia powder, and cocconut powder from Amazon and have a drink that just might be good for me.;positive
"the freshness date on my box of 2000 sweet mate packets was october 2014. right away i noticed that it comes out of the packet so much easier than most i have tried so far. i feel some granularity to it in the packet.  it is not a fine powder. it tastes pretty good. i use it a lot in iced tea and to sweeten up some other things. it says the ingredients are dextrose with maltodextrin aspartame. the net weight of each packet is 1 gram or 0.035 oz. each packet it says has the sweetness of two teaspoons of sugar and also that it is suitable for those with diabetes. it is distributed by the Merisant Company. it is hard to read those tiny letters on that packet. i am happy with this product so far. the price is pretty good too.

update:  this is my new favorite. and there is less frustration getting it out of the packet. it flows right out quickly. this is my number one choice now. i will not be buying any of the others that i have been trying out ever again. this product is great!";positive
"These honey roasted Sesame Sticks are delicious. There is a slight hint of sweetness that doesn't take away the flavor of the sesame. They are crisp, fresh and really the best I've tasted.

I have always loved sesame sticks but haven't bought them in awhile but I've never tasted any that are as good as this..

Don't go by the package shown - it looks very dark and a little dangerous but when you get them in person they look wonderful - a nice medium brown color that bears no resemblance to the Sincerely Nuts package which to me looks very dark but I bought them anyway because I've purchased tons of stuff from Sincerely Nuts and have been pleased with everything....including nuts and pineapple (dried) and etc. Their pistachios are to die for! So if you are a lover of sesame sticks these are by far the yummiest--you just have to be careful not to eat the whole package because they are that tempting!!";positive
Fresh and tasty. Mostly halves;positive
Couldn't stop eating them;positive
"Purchased as gifts... there were well received.  To be fair, I also sampled one of the them - it was very moist, very ""rummy"" tasting.  The cakes are small.. something on the range of a large cupcake... but that is what I was looking for.  The boxes themselves lend well to gift giving - I added a gold ribbon bow and tag.  Perfect for my use.  Hope this info was useful to you in making your decision as that is my whole reason for writing my unbiased, uncompensated reviews!";positive
I love this salt. I even bought a 2 lb bag so now i fill this little shaker with more whenever i need. I also put on a screw cap from another spice container that has a pop top with holes. So now it has two sets of holes for the salt to go through so it slows down the pour rate some. Otherwise, I would always forget and put too much salt in the food. Plus this salt is more saltier, so you can use a little less.;positive
They're a little hard to operate because they're so small and don't turn very easily either, but other than that it's a nice product.  I have owned the larger grinders by McCormick's and they are perfect and last for a very long time.;positive
Purchased these for a Christmas gift for a co-worker - this variety is her favorite! ALL please be advised if you purchase an item from Harney & Sons - you will be INUNDATED with pop-up ads everywhere!! For that reason alone, I will NEVER purchase any Harney merchandise!!!!!;positive
Great mix of beverages;positive
"This is my first time trying ceremonial grade matcha and I have to give it two thumbs up, or in this case 5 stars.  It has a deep rich earthy taste.  Similar to what you get at high-end authentic Japanese restaurants. I'm not an expert, but this seems like the real deal in terms of high quality.  It smelled amazing when I opened it and it has a beautiful green color.  It also made me feel alert without any type of crash later.

Although I bought this to make matcha green tea lattes, I didn't care for it as much as kitchen grade matcha.  I liked this matcha best as straight up tea.  I didn't think its earthy taste went well with milk and honey; however, it's all about preference.  If you're only familiar with ceremonial grade matcha you won't know the difference.  For me personally, I enjoyed drinking this in its most authentic form, but I'll be getting regular kitchen grade stuff for my lattes.";positive
quick delivery on this size of Dandy Blend and I've already re-ordered and received the larger size ...  pleased with short delivery time and I have cut down my coffee consumption to a few cups a week .... love this stuff!  pleased with seller;positive
Extreme lactose intolerence prompted us to find a milk substitute.  This is really good.  Actually it is really, really good.  I like the smaller size individual packaging so you aren't wasting product after opening.  We purchased a case, it has great shelf life, put case in the fridge and I'm surprised how nice it is to be able to grab a carton for cooking, cereal, drinking.  It is really a great product.;positive
Fair price , arrived on time;positive
What a treat with dessert or later some evenings when I just want a cup of coffee but also want to sleep well. The flavor is robust and pairs perfectly with rich chocolate or cheesecake or the more sweet desserts like ice cream and fruits. A lovely way to wrap up dinner. For friends that I know have Keurig coffee makers a little box or bag of these is a wonderful hostess gift.;positive
Actually more like adulthood favorite. Chocolate tootsie pops have always been one of my favorite things to grab when the chocolate craving monster invades. I have only seen packages of only one flavor, as opposed to mixed flavors, here on Amazon. I also have bought the cherry flavored, but chocolate is my go to. These are great for anyone needing a taste of chocolate without a huge splurge since they do take more than 3 licks to get to the center of the tootsie pot.;positive
Great product! This is a large bottle. The quality is very good. It looks like tiny little beads. Directions say 3 teaspoons per cup. Use less if you like. It mixes easily with cold or hot water and produces a fine foam at the top. The taste is a smooth roasted flavor not bitter. It can be mixed with your coffee too.  It's great for you non-coffee non-caffeine drinkers. Chicory promotes bile production which helps digestion. After several cups I can feel the twinge from the pancreas. The Nature version is natural and has no additions such as the Carmel flavor that has cocoa as a flavoring addition. I must stay away from coffee, cocoa, and vanilla since they are produced with a moldy fermentation process.  That is very bad for folks like me with candida. Carob is okay because it is not fermented.  I love this Chicory drink mix. I would order many times again!;positive
The best salt. Ever.;positive
Great for travel but rather expensive when shipping is included.  Our Costco used to carry these and they were quite economical, but it no longer has them.  I am allergic to milk and airplanes and many hotels do not have alternatives to milk for adding to coffee.;positive
Love it! My favorite coffee syrup.;positive
Del Monte products are high quality and these are great plain or on cottage cheese.  The only reason I didn't give the order five stars is that the cans were dented.  It seems that most of my canned food orders from Amazon come dented.;positive
Love this bread!;positive
"I think these are a great healthy treat for on the go families like ours.  I even bought special spoons that will screw on the end of these pouches so my baby can eat them.  Bonus!

The price on Amazon is so much more reasonable than at our local grocery store!";positive
received the product fast love it;positive
Organic whole grain wheat (when do you see that?) - High in fiber, low in added sugar, NO sodium, and 6g of protein, and tastes great. Most other cereals are like giving yourself or your kids candy for breakfast. Put on some fresh or dried fruit, add some crushed or sliced nuts and soy, almond, or skim milk and it is a hearty breakfast that sticks with you.;positive
Great for mead.;positive
"I'm about to order more of this Twining's Afternoon Tea that I just tried recently.  They recommend it with milk - I use it plain as an iced tea and it is delicious.  I add 2 bags of Bigelow's Mint Medley to the pot since I no longer live where I can pick fresh mint.

This tea has a good flavor, strong enough to know it's tea, which is important if you are serving it over ice, no bitterness, a tinge of sweetness to it.  No doubt I'll enjoy it  hot in winter.

I sweeten my Tea with Splenda to avoid too much sugar.  Works great.  All of these products can be purchased in quantity at good prices on amazon.  I hope Twining comes out with a larger box so I can get even a better price.

Order this one and enjoy!";positive
Love that you can order six boxes;positive
Love this vanilla.  Taste great!;positive
:);positive
All time favorite! Fresh and yummy!;positive
I love this soup. I finally found it and can get it delivered to my home on a regular basis too. I have this and a package of ramen for my lunch it is a great way to trim down. I am not starving until dinner time either.;positive
"Is real marmalade exclusive to England?

no

But if this is the taste one associates with childhood marmalade flavors no other excellent or otherwise will suffice.  Amazon prime shipping makes the cost more palatable.

Coarse cut .... so you know there are bits of orangey goodness inside

original ... so it's not overpoweringly sweet

win";positive
These are decadent. They melt in your mouth the chunks of chocolate in them are sizable and there's nothing about their taster texture that gives away the fact they're better for you then usual cookies. We will be buying them again.;positive
1!!;positive
These are good came early as well.;positive
Fresh and chewy!!!  Yummy!;positive
Fantastic, natural product that gives wide latitude when canning fruit products for jam, jellies, and preserves. Easy to use, does not loose effectiveness, allows for varied amounts depending on the 'set' desired. Does not change the flavors of fruits or other products used. Love it!!;positive
"We LOVE this.  It's strong and perfect.  It's sour and sweet in a perfect balance that reminds me of lemonade, but in strong tart cherry form.  It's really something special.

It also makes me cough and congested, so I'll have to figure out what I'm allergic to.  :(  Suspects include hibiscus, rose hips, and possible sulfites.  I emailed tea-forte to ask if this has sulfites, as the box isn't labeled but it's a common additive to keep dried cherries fresh.  They emailed me 2-3 times to tell me they were looking into it, then again to ask how their service was.  I will need to initiate another inquiry!";positive
I always have at least one jar one hand.  The raspberry is the only flavor that I like in [[ASIN:B004M8O3BI Lipton Lipton Diet Iced Tea Mix, Raspberry, 10 quart, 2.6-Ounce (Pack of 4) of the instant diet teas.  You can make a pitcher or make it by the glassful as needed.;positive

I picked these up to fill, as economically as possible, a Brookstone motion activated candy dispenser.  A few too many yellows and greens for my liking, but what'cha gonna do?  The dispenser is at work.  I'd be in a sugar coma if I kept the thing at home.;positive
while no junk food or snack food is actually good for us...this one comes close to being satisfying for a salty snack with lots of  cheesy taste but without the strange ingredients of the other popular cheese puff brands.  I like them.  Light and they  do not upset the system with additives and colorings.  A little too addictive with all the salt but if you can be disciplined this is a good alternative when you simply must have something crunchy and salty to eat.  I would buy them again.  No orange fingers and no weird carb feeling after eating them.;positive
We've bought these a couple of times, and they are amazing!  They taste like from-scratch, oven-fresh rolls from a really good bakery. Tried them for hamburgers and sandwiches, but they're delicious just with some butter or jam, or to accompany cheese.  A new staple in our house!;positive
Really nice I cook and add chicken to it and  coconut milk plus extra spices garam masala it tastes creamy, they way I like it, my complaint would be it's so little of a portion...and more sauce would be great;positive
Very good flavor and texture .;positive
I really like this stevia.  The other posters are right about each packet only containing a tiny amount, but it is super powerful.  For a cup of tea, I only use half.  It may look like its not dissolving and you will see tiny specks when you stir, but it doesn't matter, the tea is sweet.  The taste is just plain sweet, very clean tasting.  I am amazed at how much filler must be in other sweetener packets.  If you are a stevia person, I highly recommend giving this a try.  I will be buying it again.;positive
I paid only $19.21 less than $20 dollars for 120 Tea Bags. You could drink one cup of guava leaf tea a week for a whole year and still have some left over. As soon as I opened the box I was greeted by the aroma of the guava leaf tea. You can drink this tea hot or cold.  This tea is caffeine free, supports digestion, and healthy blood sugar levels. Many people still use tea as a traditional remedy. This tea is used as a herbal dietary supplement and I often enjoy a cup before I go to bed.;positive
I enjoy these candies;positive
This is some high quality aloe juice. I drink some daily to aid in digestion, but also use it for skin irritations and sunburn. Would definitely recommend. The taste is something that requires getting used to.;positive
"I'd been drinking Starbuck's French Roast and so maybe I destroyed my tastebuds, but I was disappointed with this coffee.  I've had Jeremiah Picks and thought it was superior in taste to the SF Bay French Roast, both decaf and regular.  I was not hit with that fresh-roasted smell when I opened the bag.  I'd give it 3 starts, except that the ""Starbuck's Effect"" might have come into play here.";positive
"If you like vanilla flavored coffee, this is the best out there. It's full bodied and tastes like ""real"" coffee while at the same time satisfying that need for vanilla taste. I've tried many other vanilla flavored brands but this remains my favorite.";positive
"I am a chicory coffee lover from New Orleans and use only Community New Orleans Blend.  I use a single-cup brewer when I want coffee and don't want to make it in a regular brewer or ask my wife to make me some.  K-cups are convenient, but the resulting coffee is not as rick tasting as coffee made in traditional coffee brewers.  (Remember when coffee was always made in coffee ""pots"" rather than ""brewers'?  Coffee made with a French-drip coffee pot was excellent but a little time consuming.)";positive
"I originally bought this to drink with just water and sweetener (just as I use cacao powder), However, I really don't feel like it tastes as much like coco as other reviews had said.  I did use it in a ""healthy fudge"" recipe and it was delicious!  It was a really good price for bulk product with very fast delivery.  I would definitely buy again next time I need carob powder";positive
Tastes a bit salty to me but I add a spoonful of homemade flavored syrup (equal quantities of sugar and water on quick boil with a squeeze of fresh fruit juice) to entice the kids away from cola and that works fine.;positive
These are delicious and taste fresh;positive
Awesome Maple syrup.;positive
As an aggressive exerciser (MTB Biking, Power Rowing, Elliptical Machine et al) am always searching for stuff to improve my energy level.  Being a vegetarian, the fact Goji Berries are organic and a source of protein, plus contain 18 amino acids, 21 trace minerals, vitamin A, B-complex, C and E, and is a superior form of antioxidants. the order was placed. These little guys are tasty, and are so good and the fact studies indicate they are one of the most nutrient-rich foods on earth. I just included  Goji Berries 2 pound size in my monthly Subscribe & Save order, and in fact recently purchased two (02) goji berry potted shrubs for the patio.;positive
I love the chunky vegetables in Ragu as well as the flavor of the sauce. We buy this because, not only do I love veggies, but I also have to hide them in foods since my boyfriend is anti-veggie. Even though the veggies are a bit chunkier, he still eats my world famous spaghetti. Little does he know it's not a homemade sauce (most of the time), although I do add various seasonings to the meat. The size is enough for us to make 2 generous meal of spaghetti with enough for leftovers for work. I also use this sauce for stuffed shells with spinach and ricotta cheese.;positive
"I have these with microwave heated Tostitos nacho cheese sauce, a Hormel bacon bits sprinkle and side of ketchup. Voila I'm on the Coney Island Boardwalk.
Even alone and unsalted these are delicious. Tastes like actual potatos which all oven fries do not. Crispy outside. Mushy (good mushy) inside. Prefer them a little overcooked. Yum.";positive
Great item for Paleo dieters.;positive
I discovered THIS FABULOUS COFFEE on Amazon while looking for another coffee the Keurig site was out of -- I've ordered Wild Jo K-cups through AMAZON PRIME for almost a year.  It's the best, dark, richest, NEVER ACID coffee I've ever savored, honest!  I still order Wild Jo K-cups, but I needed loose, ground coffee for a new COLD BREW pitcher I'd found on Amazon -- a whole new way of making coffee -- a cup of good ground coffee in a quart of room temp, filtered water in the fridge for 24 hours.  The pitcher comes with an infuser strainer, a mess to clean, so I didn't use that part the second time.  It's great iced and I can just nuke it to get hot coffee.  If you like rich, strong, flavorful coffee, there's nothing better than Wild Jo !!!  Jo Coffee offers other not-so-strong coffee, but I'm spoiled with Wild Jo, so I'll probably never get to taste the others.;positive
Always a great cup of tea.;positive
"Without a doubt, this is a quality product.  We've been buying a variety of berry powders from different vendors (raspberry, maqui, blueberry, aronia (chokeberry), etc.) and this one is by far the best tasting.  Seems quite fresh.

Although it is not organic, the company has this to say about it:
""We are not certified organic, however, we are firmly committed to providing our customers with black raspberries that are not only of the highest quality and phytonutrient level, but are also tested pesticide free.

Because BerriHealth's black raspberries are used in numerous human clinical trials and research projects, we are very careful to make sure that we test our berries for any trace of pesticides or other chemicals. Even if a farm does not use pesticides themselves, there are plenty of potential ways for their crops to be contaminated (a strong wind and spraying at a neighboring farm, for example). Basically, we grow our berries the right way, and then prove it with our testing through an excellent independent lab. BerriHealth also makes sure our berries consistently have high levels of the healthy phytonutrients that our black raspberries are known for worldwide. So all the good stuff is in there year in and year out!

BerriHealth's partner, Sturm's Berry Farm, has been ecologically farming black raspberries for over 70 years in the foothills of Mt. Hood in Oregon. They work with local government sustainability programs to study everything from native Oregon bees to keeping healthy soil. They use things like drip irrigation which cuts down on water usage and creates smaller, more flavorful berries during harvest. As well, the Sturms' farm focuses on Integrated Pest Management (IPM) instead of chemicals to control unwanted bugs.""  --BerriHealth web site

We dropped a star since the price is extremely high.  Just seems a bit expensive for this amount of powder, but at least it is quite good.  If we don't purchase it in the future, it is because of an affordability issue.";positive
"I've tried several so called ""Raw Honey's"" I had the real deal years ago, There is no mistaking raw from some store bought honey. Somethings one should know, There are over 300 different types of honey, Honey is antibacterial and antiseptic:Raw organic honey contains hydrogen peroxide, released when it comes into contact with moisture. Hydrogen peroxide is both antibacterial and fungicidal.  Raw honey doesnt cause the blood sugar to spike. It allows a much healthier gradual increase in blood sugar levels. And we only need a teaspoon to make a difference. The Honest Raw Honey,Is unaltered, does not contain antibiotics, chemicals, additives, herbicides, pesticides. This company owns their bee hives right here in the United States of America. you just don't find that claim these days. We use raw honey for not only sweetener but for medicinal values. We have tried so many and this one ""Honest Raw Honey"" is by far the best we have had to date. If you want what they advertise ""Honest Raw Honey,"" then you need to do yourself a healthy favor and try this. I don't believe you will be disappointed.";positive
Excellent in a protein shake!!!;positive
A lot of different flavors;positive
I realized that if you are still squeezing the bottle while you are turning it upright the drops will roll down onto your fingers or onto the bottle and be wasted. Plus the sweetener stays on your finger tips. I know you may be thinking this would never happen to ME, but trust me, you don't want to waste this stuff. It really is great and it is better than having all of those expensive little yellow packets to deal with. The only thing that I prefer the little packets for is sprinkling over fruit. I will definitely reorder this product again!;positive
Perfect portion size so I don't have to guess.  Price is very reasonable for a pack of 48, which is actually 2 boxes of 24.  I just grab a bag and throw it into my lunch bag and when I need a quick pick me up, there are my natural almonds.  Taste great.  No complaints about this product.  These are also great to add to your smoothies (need to grind them first) or put on desserts.;positive
Beautiful plant! Packed well and arrived in perfect condition. I ordered it when I was sure the weather/temperature wouldn't kill it in transit. Very happy it was delivered alive and healthy. Nice full size and has 5 flowers in bloom.;positive
Nice flavor, great brew;positive
We love Nutiva products and this virgin coconut oil is no exception.  This is excellent for cooking or as a butter substitute.  This is the most affordable way to purchase....buy in bulk and save.  Hope the price doesn't go up now with all the 5 star reviews.;positive
If you enjoy a love-hate-love relationship with green teas (as I do), this is the one. Chai spices mellow the green leaves wonderfully. You get cinnamon on the first sip, then green and orange, then the final finish of cloves. With such spices, the health benefits are probably off-the-charts, too. Davidson's has created an almost Christmas blend sans cloying sweetness: the magical taste of the holidays all year. My new favourite tea.;positive
Good stuff. Excellent service.;positive
I received my bagels and my loaf of bread quickly and as promised. Oh. My. Goodness: delicious! It's REAL bread! On a ketogenic diet, it's so hard to find non-eggy bread, but this bread is hands down the best I've had. I ate a PB &J sandwich yesterday using the honey bread, and I was delighted to eat a sandwich again. My last shipment had mold on it. I was too upset to return it, but I did write an honest review. A rep from ThinSlim contacted me to explain that the manufacturer had an issue with the preservatives, that had been worked out-- then offered me a refund or replacement of my order. I really wanted to try the bread, so I accepted the replacement. I'm so glad I did! You'll need to refrigerate or freeze it up in receipt, and it keeps well without getting dry. I will absolutely order with this company again. Customer service was excellent!;positive
"I am a popcorn addict and at this particular moment in time I own four different popcorn popping machines.  I don't usually use things like Flavacol Seasoning.. but when I bought the retro movie theater style popcorn popper, on a lark, I ordered this too.

I decided to try this out on the theater style popper,  and added my coconut oil and let it melt down and then sprinkled some of this into the little popping cup... and then added the popcorn.  The corn popped quickly as it always does... and I turned it out into a bowl.. and tried it!

The popcorn was yellower than it normally would be... very good.. reminiscent to movie theater popcorn however you get to control how much to add..,  it is also very strong so a little bit will go a long way if your only popping a small amount.  Do not sprinkle this on the popcorn.. it is best  used if you add it to the melted oil your popping the corn in.

If you want , you can drizzle some read melted butter into the popcorn too...  I suppose everyone knows this.. but I am going to say this just in case there is one person out there that did not realize this... don't use margarine...margarine is great for a lot of things...but a disaster on popcorn.  Margarines are full of water..so when you melt it down and pour on your popcorn.. you can actually see the popcorn kernels shrink and curl up when the margarine hits them.. for they are getting hit with water.. for real gourmet taste.. stick with real butter not margarine.

 I even sometimes  use oil instead of butter to drizzle on the top.. I have a oil spritzer that I sometimes add some of the melted coconut oil to and spritz the popcorn with the oil and used olive oil on popcorn for years...  tastes great that way too.

The container is huge for the amount you use each time, I think it is no exaggeration to say you will get hundreds of batches from one carton.

I hope this review was helpful to you.";positive
I actually cannot tell any difference in taste, but noticed these organic chia seeds are smaller and finer than other brands I've bought.  It's good to have an organic and non-gmo product.  Having discovered this brand, I'll probably buy it again.;positive
great alternative flour.  I use this flour in combination with several other alternative flours to make my own gluten free all purpose flour.  Buying the flour in bulk was less expensive and more practical, as I bake a lot!  I like and trust the quality of Bob's red mill products.;positive
Bob's mill always great stuff;positive
"I like this product because it has the touch of tartness you'd expect from apple cider. It doesn't overpower you with cloying sweetness. I do want to try one or two of the other brands at some point just as a point of comparison, but this would be hard to beat.

I noticed a couple of other reviewers said that the Amazon price was much higher than direct from vendor. Someone claimed to have paid 1.68 per cup. Well, I got two dozen from Amazon at .69 per cup, which is about three or four cents less than what it runs at my local supermarket, so mileage on price seems to vary greatly. I'd never have bought it at 1.68.

My only complaint was that it took over two weeks for my order to arrive, even though I'm a Prime member. I received two separate e-mails telling me my order had been delayed and then delayed again, but no explanation why. I would guess they were out of stock for a while and its possible that future orders would arrive in a more timely fashion. The shipping delay (without an explanation) is the reason I give it four stars instead of five. The product itself is yummy.";positive
"This is another winner from Walden Farms. No, it is not a perfect raspberry tasting spread but it does have a raspberry flavor. What is really important is that it has zero calories and makes things taste better than bare French toast or waffles. This is a real helper in keeping the daily calorie count lower and still getting some flavor help.

Same goes for the Blueberry Spread.";positive
Months ago I had my first butternut squash soup, hand made at a fancy restaurant. I do not like canned soups... but I saw this in our local grocers, and remembering the soup I had at the restaurant, I decided to try it. It was delicious! It is my favorite lunch go-to now. I have added shredded roasted turkey to make it heartier, but as for taste it is wonderful. I order the case on Amazon, which is cheaper than my local store. I also tried their french onion soup which is really good. I have avoided the others simply because in their best form, I don't like chicken noodles and tomato soups, but for the 2 I do like and have tried, they really made something from canned soups, and I'd recommend them.;positive
"This will be my first attempt at making home-made sausage.
I liked the reviews, I read about this product line.
I'll be making turkey sausage, turkey breast meat and bread crumbs with spices, eggs/and olive oil.
And a NorPro#151 meat grinder with its sausage making attachment.
At the time of purchase, I think I got my casing size correct=32mm.
The product arrived--fully frozen. I placed it into my freezer for my next batch of grinding meat.
This should be fun.";positive
I've been pleasantly surprised by these coffees as have others I've shared them with.  I'm no coffee connoisseur but these coffees seem a bit stronger and the flavors are much more noticeable than any other flavored coffees I've tried.  Bananas Fosters is my favorite, but I really enjoy them all.  The only downside is the price, which is it a bit ridiculous, but I guess compared to a coffee shop, it's tolerable.;positive
Delicious for homemade chocolate!;positive
"Rich and malty taste. I'd put in a strong category but not bitter like the black teas can be. It's good, robust tea that can take milk without becoming watery. Make it strong and enjoy with with milk or cream---a dash of cream isn't going to kill you and it makes for a rich tea experience.

If you like iced tea, don't make it too strong or it will cloud when you chill it. This a result of the water being saturated---as the water cools, it can't absorb as much of the tea and that makes it cloudy. You can always fix cloudy tea by adding a little warm water---but if you want it strong you'll have to live with cloudy tea.

This some of the best you'll find around and the price is good. I'd say one bag makes as much as a box of Limpton. [sic]";positive
Good flavor and fresh;positive
I have sent this product (Annie's white Cheddar Microwavable Macaroni) to my friends' children at college.  They LOVE it so much more than other orange brands.  They tell me the taste and texture are five stars!  Thank you for offering a great product via the Prime program.;positive
My favorite tea. Great to have;positive
This coffee is fantastic. Great taste, wonderful aroma. I keep my Tassimo in my master bathroom so I can have a cup while getting ready for the day without having to go to the kitchen and make a big pot. I was not expecting to like this coffee since its not sold in the states and I was thinking it might be geared to the tastes of other countries. But its not! Its very smooth, full flavored coffee. I will buy again.;positive
very good flavor for a jar-sauce, excellent in cooking, not too sweet, tomato-y, or acid-y, and when mixed with some homemade sauce (my personal choice for using jar sauce!) can add some low-cost/low-effort extra flavor and BULK to your pot!;positive
My memory of aloe juice is a bitter concoction that is hard to stomach.  This juice is pretty yummy and has all the benefits of aloe without the awful aloe taste.  Only 4 stars because it's a bit on the sweet side, but it calms your stomach and is refreshing.;positive
Moist and meaty.;positive
I will continue buying this coffee.;positive
Good price. Same price as Costco and significantly cheaper than standard retail!! LOVE this stuff. Pretty much use it every morning. Taste good and is filling. A serving is pretty low calorie, so I add some nuts, fruit, spinach & kale. Tasty!!;positive
this is an excellent pasta to cook in the microwave.  it cooks so fast, just a couple of minutes.  just cover with water about 1 inch deeper than the pasta.  I break it in thirds to cook in microwavable bowls or cook it in an official  pasta cooking bowl,  drain and rinse in cold water or mix with sauce or butter so it doesn't stick together.  you can add vegetables and/or meat or fish and have an entire meal.  I cook 2 servings and keep one tightly covered in the fridge for a day or 2.;positive
surprisingly tasty and nutritious.  includes a favorable amino acid profile for an all-vegetarian source.  also with a decent amount of iron.  taste is great for me, but I'm used to healthy foods.  If you like things overly sweet this might not be for you.;positive
I love this stuff.  I read where gelatine is REALLY good for you.  I heat up some beef broth and slowly stir this in and then drink like coffee.  Doesn't really add or detract in flavor but I love knowing it is in there and good for me.;positive
"Fred, my husband, requested a large Hershey's candy bar for Fathers' day.  He was amazed when the package arrived from Amazon!  5 pounds of pure Hershey's milk chocolate!  He loved every bite....not all at once....but a little at a time!  He broke up the bar and put the pieces into the freezer; then he would help himself when the mood for chocolate hit him!  Very tasty, creamy, chocolatey flavor!!";positive
delicious, sweet and smoky;positive
I will continue to buy this coffee for as long as it's sold. It's honestly one of my all time favorites. Very rich, creamy and flavorful with bout being bitter or overly harsh. Can be made stronger or a little weaker depending on how you prefer it. There's just nothing like grinding your own beans and brewing with a French press, that's where this coffee shows you just how good it is.;positive
I don't drink coffee as I get a stomach ache from caffeine but when someone who visits wants a cup this is great to have on hand.  Everyone whose had one of these  preferred it to my regular instant.  A couple of people took note of what it was so they could buy it for themselves. If the coffee drinker likes it black it's fine.  For someone who likes cream, once I ran out of fancy creamer and it was less of a hit;positive
Very tasty I purchase often.;positive
I have been using this product for many years and am very happy with it, in terms of flavor and grain size. It doesn't clump and it comes out of all my salt shakers pretty much like regular white salt. I like that it adds a nutritional note to the use of salt, by providing some natural minerals. I use it wherever table salt is called for, as well as a finishing salt.;positive
"Love this malted milk powder. If you like a good malted milk then this is the one to buy.
+ You can mix this up in milk but you will need an immersion/stick blender (if you buy one get one with a container to mix shakes, etc. in)";positive
I love this ! ;positive
love the candy.;positive
The best. Enough said. Don't buy it. So I can. I hope you hate it because, it's awesome. I don't care how many times you went to Hawaii and drank coffee25 years ago. Its expensive, but worth it in my opinion. Unless I can take money to the after life and buy coffee. I'm sure people will insist it isn't the same coffee you get on the island, at resorts. It's BETTER. What do I know and do you even care?;positive
"the quality and level of spice in this product is really delicious. as with most any canned/pouched/frozen south asian food, the salt level is way too high - not just in the taste, but seriously 1/4 of a can has 21% of FDA daily sodium?!

the peas are sweet and flavorful, not the usual sort of tough and tasteless sort you get in a lot of prepackaged foods.

what really surprised and pleased me was the paneer - not the best, but well above and beyond what you'd expect, very tasty and well made.

add: they don't super-skimp on paneer like some other brands, but I still feel like there could be a little more paneer in the can.

add: bonus points for using normal non-BPA cans. thank you!";positive
Sweet.;positive
My first experience with chick pea flour, but this one did not disappoint.  Not having anything to compare it to, I don't know if there is a better one out there or not--this is all I could have hoped it to be!;positive
quality ginger snappary;positive
I purchased this to use in soup mixes I made for Christmas gifts. I was looking for a decent mix of dehydrated veggies. I love that there are no added preservatives, just dehydrated veggies plus parsley. This container is very aromatic when you open it. It smells a bit like vegetable dip mix.;positive
Never having sugar coated fennel seeds before, I wasn't sure what to expect, but my curiosity was piqued after seeing a recommendation that fennel seeds aid in digestion. I was pleasantly pleased with their taste - not too sweet, mostly a light licorice/anise flavor, not an over-powering flavor. And, surprisingly, they actually do aid in digestion, which explains why they are often served in Indian restaurants. I definitely will purchase these again, although I wish they came in a resealable bag.;positive
I am not gluten intolerant myself but I got these on a quest to try GF options (I have a number of friends who are). I am addicted to the taste, texture and the fact they are quick energy a healthy way with honey. I am always thinking of trying other flavors but this one is so fantastic I just can't imagine liking another as much.;positive
Great tamarind powder.;positive
Yes, yes...it's all true.  This coconut oil is the real deal.  I would suggest wearing a cap when sleeping in this..because it broke me out.  But not everyone is going to break out, I'm just sensitive to breakout from oil based products.  I should have known better.  However, I have caucasian, fine wavy red hair and it felt like silk.  Jury is out on whether to use it on dry or wet hair...I chose dry and it worked beautifully.  Try it both ways and see what works best for you!;positive
"This is a great product if you like coconut water. I bought it to take
with me on my motorcycle. The taste is great it mixes well and is
convenient - what more can you ask for ? It gives you what you need
to stay hydrated and to replace lost minerals. If you have had weight
loss surgery and can no longer drink straight water without getting
nauseated this works well. An easy fix when at restaurants and you
can't drink soda. Over all a great product will be ordering more for
sure.";positive
It's great, healthy pure thyme tea.;positive
"Good product; good service.";positive
Love using manuka honey. Its medicinal abilities definitely ring true for me. I don't know how much better this gold one is compared to the 12+ Wedderspoon one I normally get, but it is good honey. I am just not sure that it is significantly better than the 12+ one. But I would buy it again.;positive
The avocados arrived within a few days of ordering. They were perfectly packed and nice sized. They were just a tad under ripe, but one day in the box and perfection. As soon as they ripen, too the fridge they go. They have lasted for two weeks, I have one left and just placed another order. A little more pricey than my local market but well worth paying for the quantity, quality and home delivery.;positive
Best flavor best spice! These do not disappoint! Love all the different seasoning packets. I just do noodles and drain and put all seasoning and fried onions (included) in and it is so yummy it should be illegal.;positive
"I purchased this salt to use where it can be seen and enjoyed. I don't use it at any time in liquids or preparations that must cook for long periods of time. To do so would be to waste the beautiful accent color...which is the main reason for using it--IMHO. It is a traditional salt in Hawaiian culture along with the red clay salts. The taste is very agreeable and it makes for a beautiful presentation. A baked potato brushed with olive oil and lightly dusted with this salt usually draws admiring looks and comments. Very useful as a finishing salt for non-liquid preparations such as a green salad or a potato salad dusted with smoked paprika mixed with this salt. Also for meat entrees, especially when served on white or light colored plates. Finishing salts are more about the look than the taste. If it were just taste, you could use any good sea salt!!

Be aware that it will mark your hands (and your clothes..) if you let it!! Use it intelligently and enjoy it. Five stars. Excellent product!";positive
Kids like these for a snack;positive
Very nice flavor.  Great snack.;positive
This coffee is a decent variety.  Good, full flavor. I think the separate bags help keep the coffee fresh as you open just a pound as you need it.  With subscription, the price is fair.  Not a coffee I would rave about.  There are some varieties at Costco I think are actually better, but lately they have not had much on hand.  This is a decent option, conveniently and quickly delivered to your home.;positive
I add vanilla extract to everything... my granola, cookies, cakes, ice creams... it is so nice to get it in such a large quantity and save myself the $$ and trips to the grocery store.  This is the best vanilla extract I've tried too, it is especially delicious in my vegan coconut milk ice cream... the little flecks of vanilla are amazing.  I recommend this product to anyone who uses a lot of vanilla!;positive
I am a huge tea drinker.  I have every tea known to man, pretty much!  This one intrigued me because it has blood sugar controlling properties, and higher in antioxidants.  I bought it, tried it, and have to say I really like it.  The taste is subtle, and light, but hard to describe.  I don't have to have very overpowering flavors, so I can enjoy this.  I haven't noticed much in the way of blood sugar regulation, but will have to keep using it to see.;positive
"I found these vitamins because my teens tasted them at a demo table at whole Foods.  They were not taking their other vitamins, not even when I reminded them.  So when they asked for these, I thought ""Why not?""  And I went to Amazon and bought them.  Now my kids remind ME when it is time to buy more.  They are expensive, but my kids' health is important to me, and if they take these, and waste the other vitamins because they don't take them, these really become a bargain.  I like them too- but I just can't justify taking them, since I actually remember to take the boring multi vitamin.  But if I had my druthers, I'd take these too.";positive
"I am new to making risotto, but this was one of the recommended brands of rice to make it. I am still learning about new variations, but this rice consistently make a nice creamy risotto. I am very happy with this brand and will continue to buy it. Although the conventional method to make risotto requires at least 30 minutes of standing over the stove to add warm broth gradually, I am finding new methods it both a rice cooker and a pressure cooker that require much less personal attention. I even found a method to cook it in the microwave and the results were really good.

UPDATE 05/25/17:
I have tried a couple of different rices for risotto, and for the price I wouldn't rate this one much better than arborio rice.";positive
These are great, especially on long bike rides.  I like all the honey stinger products, these are nearly as good as the waffles.  They are dense so you feel like you're actually eating something, and they taste quite good.  They are easy to eat when you are riding for extended periods of time, easy to get down and digest which is important because you often feel like you simply can't eat anything on high exertion rides.  This is precisely the time you do need to consume calories and these bars work very well.  They have a little chocolate on them too which I like.  Highly recommend these bars.;positive
QUICK!  Nice items and plenty of it;positive
This marmalade is much darker and richer tasting than a typical marmalade with nice thick strands of peel. In spite of this, it does not transform its marmalade signature into some sweet orange preserve imposter.;positive
Delicious spice mix and great purchase if you have not tried it before (next time will have to buy larger size because it's so good you will go through this fast). It wasn't very spicy for my taste but others may find it to have a bit of heat.;positive
I bought this along with the French Roast and I love it. I wrote a review for the French Roast so i do not want to sound repetitive. It is awesome. Great Mocha flavor and no digestive issues!! I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a great cup of coffee. My fiance` also loves it!!!!;positive
Nice to buy in bulk.;positive
Loving this protein bar.;positive
Its the best for me;positive
"So I bought this because I wanted to try another brand besides the Wolfgang's brand. Don't get me wrong the other brand is good but this Barrie House Jamaica Me Crazy is GREAT!
You can actually taste the flavors in the coffee. Not too over powering but a flavor that beats the other hands down.
Try it I honestly think if you like this flavor you will love this brand over the other one.";positive
Yummy and healthy;positive
I enjoyed this juice and my family did too.  The taste of the sparkling juices are fresh and bubbly.  I really loved the green apple flavor.  All were great.  I subscribe and save this product and buy it every few months.  It isn't expensive and is yummy.  Great for lunches.;positive
Great for a quick and easy to pack healthy lunch. Container doesnt reseal so once you open it, theres no saving for later - but the size is good and dressing is ample enough to get good lettuce coverage. Like that theres lots of toppings and everything tastes fresh.;positive
The best for paella;positive
I use this all natural product ( as a protein booster.  As a vegetarian,  I add a spoonful to various soups and sauces,  to boost my daily protein intake.  If stirred in slowly and evenly, there are no lumps, and the end product is slightly thicker.  For whatever  the  peanut butter powder does not add a  P.B. taste to my soup or sauce.  Go figure!;positive
These are very hard to find in grocery stores and food stores in my area. The Tastykake Brianne sells a variety of pies in my area up a coconut cream is not one of them and I knew I would enjoy them and I was not disappointed they were very tasty they're very addictive. They're great with a cup of hot coffee or hot tea or  or on their own.  The only reason I am not giving this product a five star review is because I consider the price is too high and I will not be ordering again because of that.  I'm  estimating the math and it and it came to around $2.50 or so a pie and that is pretty expensive considering in the stores the TastyCake brand pies sell for something like $1.79 so that is the reason why it's getting a four star review other than that I would have given it a five star review.;positive
Nice, heavy blocks of salt, just about fit my size 8 feet but it probably isn't critical that your whole foot is covered. I am new to salt crystals and their benefits so all I can say is the product appears to be good quality, not cracked or damaged in shipping, and if I notice anything else I'll post again. Oh- I was surprised that there was no instruction sheet, invoice, reorder form or anything in the package with it- just the salt blocks. So if you want to know how they work you'll have to do your own research.;positive
Wife drinks this every day.;positive
"Finally I've found a Decaf coffee worthy of drinking. For a month I've been looking for a good Decaf coffee close to the taste of regular coffee, I've tried over 50 brands of Decaf coffee and I was so happy when I made it fresh this morning. It's almost to a point if I didn't know it was a Decaf, I would have thought it was a regular coffee. It's funny, Fresh Roasted Coffee brand has been my favorite coffee (Regular Tanzanian Peaberry, and Papua New Guinea is two of my favorite non-decaf), I've waited until now. I think from now on, I'll stick to Fresh Roasted Coffee brand coffees.
PS: Secret for K-cup coffee drinkers-  if you are using Keurig, you will need to use a coffee grinder to re-ground the ground coffee to fine powder, then use that to brew the K-cup coffee, it will come out Awesome!";positive
excellent product & great price.;positive
This if my second bottle I have ordered.  Use it whenever the recipe calls for corn syrup.  Love the taste and it has no after taste. However, I just purchased this Aug. 6, it is now Aug. 18th, and the price has gone up $8.27.  Will have to order less frequently.;positive
This is one of my favorite K cups and has been since I purchased my Cuisinart Keurig. This is a delicious lighter roast that anyone will appreciate. It is very consistent. I have bought who knows how many of these K cups and they are always good.;positive
I put this stuff on EVERYTHING. LOL. I can't tell you how many times I've re-purchased this. They sell it at health stores or grocery stores now too, but I LOVE the convenience and price of amazon. I'm telling you this stuff is the bomb. Buy it! It makes veggies takes WAY better! I learned about this in one of my diet cookbooks.;positive
I always enjoy this coffee.;positive
"These are some awesome organic cashews. I've been comparing the products of a number of companies over the past few years, and this product takes first place in terms of being organic, price, and the quality. These cashews are delicious--the only challenge is not eating them by the pound! ;)  (Not to mention, these are WHOLE cashews, and I've seen almost no pieces, so far)";positive
Good expresso and is really taste;positive
I'm curious about natural sweeteners, and this is the first stevia I'd tried. The flavor is clean, clear, and sharply sweet, with no aftertaste. I've since tried a couple of other stevia sweeteners, and this one provides the best results.;positive
taste great! less calories!;positive
I buy sugar free cough drops - mostly for dry mouth.  I like being able to purchase in bulk like this AND that the drops are not stale.  This is a good way to purchase sugar free cough crops in the cool menthol flavor!  If you are buying this many you already know what they taste like - brisk!;positive
Delicious high end chocolates;positive
great for camping;positive
Very very good and fresh:);positive
Have one every morning I love em.;positive
"I am a first time customer and a new Stevia Select fan! So far I've only tried the Stevia in the powder form and I love it!. I  really like this product and was excited to learn of the other flavored liquid varieties that are offered by ""Stevia Select"". Before making my purchase I read mostly positive reviews which I can now tell you were very accurate, and only a few negative reviews some of which complained of an after taste, another said the product was not sweet enough, This was Not True for me. I found this Product to have NO AFTER TASTE and it is VERY SWEET. It is delicious but ""Use Very Little"" because this product is potent!";positive
Great taste!  Seriously.  Who knew salt could taste different.  I mean salt is salt right?  Wrong.  My nutritionist recommended this so that I would be getting my essential elements, but really, on popcorn?  Yum.  Best salt I've every tasted.;positive
Love my nespresso;positive
"Delicious, Pickle Juice Lovers will love this. There's no hint of that ""electrolyte sports drink"" flavor.
It might be anecdotal, coincidence, but when I drink a shot before going to bed I do not get those awful leg cramps and spasms!
Because it's high in Potassium you might want to check with your doctor.
I will keep ordering and drinking this Pickle Juice Lovers' Delight.";positive
Has a very mild rich sorta smokey flavor.  Seems super healthy.  Love it.  Definitely an ongoing use health product for me. A better choice than coconut for use with savory foods.  For baking something like oatmeal cookies then I'd use the coconut.  Nice to add the choice.  Nice bottle.;positive
Nutty and grainy - yum;positive
"Great for the beginner or occasional use. I just started making and stuffing my own sausage last fall. The casings are various lengths but are solid. No bursts!

This year I will move up to larger packs of full length casings only because I plan on doing a lot more and different sausages.";positive
I find I really like this.  To me it is a lot better than starbacks and a lot, lot cheaper.  It does not have a bitter taste.  It runs about $10 per pound.  A steal I think.  I use about 4 pounds a year drinking for six months.  I actually like it at least as much as kona.  And I love kona medium. Definitely worth trying.;positive
Best mayo I have had;positive
Nice tea sampler;positive
I discovered farro while on an extended trip to Italy.  No matter where I was or how it was prepared I loved it.  I came home determined to add this great, healthy grain to my family's diet.  Everyone who tastes it feels as I do.....  Yum!;positive
I love these single serve instant grits. Great price for such a large box of goodness. I mix 1-2 with some honey or butter depending on flavor and mood. I recommend to any1 on the go or that just loves grits. Will definitely buy agian soon as I'm close to running out.;positive
"Great for adding flavor to soups and stews, and for giving a little boost to the flavor of ground beef.

To make ground beef stretch inexpensively, I buy a higher-fat variety and add a little TVP to absorb the excess fat (and flavor!) and add a little of McCormick's beef base to season it.  I can get an extra 25-30% weight out of a pound of beef without it being dry or bland.";positive
The first package arrived with all bags opened in some manner, most likely due to pressure in shipping (plastic bags broke at sections along the seam). Amazon shipped again and the packages were fine. This mix makes great tasting pancakes! I plan on buying again. However, this product would be even *better* if it were organic.;positive
This product is a little expensive, but I think it tastes good and was extremely convenient to pack in my husband's lunches for work. He loves them too. In order to save a little money, we order them through the Subscribe and Save program to get the discount.;positive
"I started out with the MatchaDNA 3 oz product which has the matcha powder in single serving packets which is convenient for when i travel or need to take some with me, but i mostly drink this at home and at the office so much prefer the 10 oz bulk package which is so much more economical.

I enjoy a cup of Matcha Latte almost every morning at home which i use instead of coffee.  Delicious!  Keeps me alert and focused and tastes really good.  It is also a big hit at the office now.  10 ounces goes a long way...";positive
I love these things! I'm so happy to find an alternative to fruity sauces for my daughter. She loves being able to feed herself, but I hate giving her too much fruit in a day because it affects her tummy. These are great and taste wonderful too!;positive
very good, love to work with them;positive
I love this PB.  I usually mix it right before I eat it and I can mix it to the consistency that I like.  I use it to spread on dip so I make it thicker and when I use it for a dip, I can mix it less thick.  It taste great and I don't feel guilty eating a larger amount because of the low fat.  Been eating this for a couple of years now.;positive
"I make mocha at home on a daily basis, and I always have at least one bottle of chocolate syrup/sauce in the kitchen. I have tried Hershey's, Nestle, and Torani as they are the only accessible items in local stores. Knowing Ghirardelli brand, I decided to give this one a try.

The bottle design is something separates this one from all the others. It has a special tip that prevents spillage and mess. Not a drop stays outside of that tip after a firm squeeze.

Comparing to other 3 I mentioned above, it smells, tastes, and looks more like chocolate. However this level of quality is something I have to adjust to. Unlike Hershey's or Nestle, this sauce is denser. Meaning, it is harder to incorporate with beverages (like mocha). Being more like natural chocolate, it is not as sweet as other brands. If you add more of the sauce, you will end up with dark chocolate taste which takes over the coffee flavor. I think I need to use less but add a little sweetener. I have used it 3-4 times, and I still haven't perfected the ratios for my taste.

It doesn't require refrigeration as long as it's in a dry & cool place, but it is recommended that you use within 3 weeks of opening the bottle.

Considering price, accessibility, and taste I think Torani and Nestle are better value overall for me as a mocha consumer. But, if you are looking for a high quality chocolate sauce, this is it. I don't recommend Hershey's as it tastes the worst among 4, and also the only one that contains High Fructose Corn Syrup.";positive
1 of my favorites;positive
This is the most amazing cocoa powder. I have purchased this 3 times on Amazon and will continue. When you taste the difference in your recipes with the Valrhona, you will realize it is totally worth the extra money! The intensity of the chocolate is impressive. The cakes you bake with this vs hersheys or other store bought will be a completely different color and texture. Cake baked with valrhona is darker and richer. This is what all the professional chefs are using. Amazon has the best price as compared to other french pastry supply web sites.;positive
Good product and good waffles.;positive
This is my new favorite drink in the morning.  It gives me energy and I love that I can adjust the strength by adding less or more powder. I just put the powder in my mug, slowly add hot water, and whisk it really well. I love it.;positive
This is my favorite GF pasta. It has the consistency and texture of regular pasta, not starchy or slimy like some grain mixes out there. However, the price is a little high. This pasta is the number one pasta in Europe and that is where I first tried it. The only thing I don't like it's that it's mostly made out of corn and it doesn't state it it's GMO or not, which matters to me.;positive
Now this was a wonderful surprise .. sooo soft & fresh, and a strawberry flavor like heaven. In fact, softer than ANY bulls eyes or caramel creams I ever bought at the store !! Arrived really fast. Now I gotta see if they have caramel apple & reorder more !!;positive
Love this oatmeal.  The extra thick version is perfect for homemade granola.  I use it for all kinds of gluten free treats.  It also make amazing dog treats.  You can really taste the difference between Bob's Redmill and Quaker.  You won't go wrong with this product.;positive
I bought this from a members club a few years ago and was never able to find it after i ran out.  I looked everywhere with no luck.  I kept the old container for reference and decided to type it in on a search on amazon and I was surprised that it pulled up and was in stock!  This stuff is great on fish chicken kebabs and more.  Its very versatile seasoning and I'm going to remember where I can get it now and just hope it is in stock when it runs out this time!!!;positive
"Meyer Lemon tea is very good. Comes in individually wrapped packs for each bag. This makes really good sun tea.
Caffeine free so I can enjoy it any time of day. It has a very light flavor that is slightly sweet.";positive
Very good and great taste;positive
I seldom find a DARK ROAST that I like for my Keurig and this one is FANTASTIC! Smooth not bitter but the roast is perfect to linger dancing circles on my tongue. If you appreciate a GREAT CUP of coffee you will not be dissapointed. I have this now on my wish list!;positive
So, this is only 5 calories and has all of these things that are super good for you. I was all willing to hate it. I got it as a free sample with another purchase, so I was not committed to liking it at all. I took a drank and it was actually pretty decent. It is healthy, low in calories, and actually tastes pretty darn good. I was surprised. My only draw back was that it does contain caffeine, which I try to avoid.;positive
One of my favorite k cups brands!;positive
I was happy to find these as my wife has allergies to food preservatives.  I use the Bob's Red Mill Potato Flakes in my bread baking and to thicken soups, etc.  Just like the other ones at the store, except for the added chemical junk!;positive
I continue to order these over and over again. There is nothing out there that taste like these they are truly the best peanut butter cup I've ever had. Note sometimes they arrive a little melted or have previously melted and then dried back up.;positive
"This was a gift for my mom for this Christmas, after I was tasked with finding a ""really nice decaf"" coffee. She LOVES it, and cannot believe that it is decaffeinated! She tells me that it is very mellow, with just a hint of caramel, and is just wonderful :) Even my sister, who has been known to say that she ""would like coffee, if only it tasted like it smells"", lol, will sit down and enjoy a cup of it with mom :)

Mom says that she doesn't know how you all do it, but please don't stop ; ) so thank you from all of us!";positive
"Love the favor it gives my food . This along with garlic , onions , adobo and thyme ; I use on chicken , pork , sea foods . Simply Organic is the way to go . You can really taste the improve taste of your food and you use less . Some times I don't have onions and garlic to chop up , but with SIMPLY ORGANIC I don't miss it . It can also enhance onion and garlic favor .";positive
This is my go to coffee.  I drink regular coffee first thing in the morning, but the rest of the day Newman's Own Organics Special Decaf coffee is my go to coffee.  It's a smooth coffee.  I love Newman's Own products.;positive
This oil was green when I got it, which is different from the oil I usually get, but it is perfect. I love it, I think that it is better than anything I have used before, and it smells earthy when first opened. I will be buying this again and again.;positive
I am just so happy with this item. I have used it for candy, cakes, mixing with sugar for fancy sugar cubes and even mixed it with glycerin soap and gel candles all with stunning results. I highly recommend both the seller and the product.;positive
my 5th grader loves this kind of oatmeal so we bought it in bulk. it does not have too much sugar and is organic. works for us as an alternative to cereal which we are trying to get him away from. oatmeal helps with his bowel movements, keeping them regular and healthy.;positive
"I like this pepper; three kinds of pepper in it and it smells great when I add it to my cooking.  The bottle is full so not much comes out at the beginning, but after a little more is used the pepper comes out through the grinder at a nice amount.  This is my sixth bottle of seasoning from this company.";positive
Awesome coconut cream,however it wasn't totally smooth like other brands I've tried. I think that may be due to the fact they do not use any gums, but I can live with the texture knowing they don't use the gums. Also I think the can is bpa free as well. great product.;positive
"This stuff rocks!  Just as good as from any local organic/authentic Indian shop around here (MSP), at a fraction of the cost. The cheap price from Amazon made me a bit apprehensive to be honest, but don't fear, this is a very bright-well-rounded spice.
Will buy more!";positive
This reminds me of caramel sans the sugar. I don't eat any form of sugar so its nice to just have the caramel flavor. I keep it in the refrigerator so it is firm and then scoop a little out an roll it in bee pollen for a treat. I also use it in my fat tea in the morning.;positive
my dog loves it!;positive
Looking forward to better health and to lose weight. I hear that if you every day take one Tablespoon full with a full glass of water 2xdaily it will fill your stomach up making it feel full, therefore causing you to eat less, and eventually lose weight too. Take if quickly very fast though, because it will quickly expand, and if you don't swallow fast enough, you could choke, as product begins to form into expanding gelly like substance. THat is how it makes you feel full, by expanding itself many times it's normal size. If you have a swallowing disorder, perhaps you'd best cook with it in a receipe instead, so you won't choke on it.;positive
"I am revising my review (docking one star) because the price I pay through Subscribe and Save more than doubled from last month to this.  I no longer feel it's worth buying at Amazon at the current price.  I still wholeheartedly recommend this product, but be wary of price changes.  I was paying a little over 3 bucks a bag until it suddenly skyrocketed.

My original review:

We are vegetarian and gluten free, and I have a subscribe and save subscription to this millet because it's so helpful for cooking.  I grind it into millet flour in my Vitamix (grain attachment) and it's a great GF flour that's very useful in recipes like pizza dough.  I also cook it up to use in place of rice in a lot of dishes.  You can pressure cook it in the Instant Pot very quickly and it makes a huge batch that you can use all week.  You can mix in taco spices and brown it in a little oil to make a great vegan taco filling.  You can also use it in homemade veggie patties, vegetarian meat loaf, etc. when combined with some smashed black beans or pinto beans, sauteed onion and shredded veggies, etc.  It's quite cheap, organic, nutritious and versatile.  Be sure to season it as it doesn't have much flavor on its own.  Better Than Bouillon makes some great natural flavorings, or you can use soy sauce, spices, you name it.";positive
"The tea certainly has things in it that are designed to relax you. However, this is not as ""sleep"" based as I would have liked it to have been. A few ""related products"" later and I seemed to have got a tea that wasn't what I originally looked for, something to make you really tired. The tea, however is nice, and there is nothing wrong with it. The four star rating comes from simply one thing: it's a bit too tart. (That's being generous) Whatever ingredient that is causing the sour / tart flavor is a bit too much. Tone that down a bit and this would be a five star relax tea (not sleep inducing...but relaxing)";positive
Great flavor. reasonable price;positive
I make vegan ice cream and dates is one of my sweeteners.  I lived in California so dates are abundant and luscious there, but after moving to Michigan, I knew I had to find a new source for my dates.  The local store had Medjool, but they were dry and usually need to be soaked.  These dates are even better from what I remember in California!  And they came three days early!  I'm going to be a regular consumer of these lovely dates.;positive
"I was very disappointed when I realized the former product of Stevia I had been using not only was coming from China but that an ingredient was added to the packaging label.  I felt decieved and sent all bottles back once I realized from other reviews that this extra unwanted ingredient was added.
 I came upon this product from Stevia Select and am very pleased with it so far.  The communication about the product from the owners of the business is very good and the product is just what I was looking for.";positive
My kids LOVE this stuff! My son is deathly allergic to all nuts, so this provides us with a safe alternative to trail mix. My kids ask for this on a regular basis and easily go through half a bag in one setting. It's a good mix too of sweat, salty, crunchy, chewy. Great job!;positive
Sent this care package to my cousin who had just arrived at college. Hoping she avoids gaining the freshman 15, I decided to go healthy. She loved this! Would seriously send to a friend or family member again - quality brands and huge amount for price and ships so quickly with prime!;positive
So good!!! Love!;positive
Kids wanted it.;positive
"This stuff really is amazing. I've never tried hibiscus-based teas before, except as a minor ingredient, and picked some up to help with a relative's blood pressure (there's now a lot of evidence of benefit from human clinical trials) and gave it a try. Absolutely lovely! And remarkably, I even the used leaves are edible, and taste good: try mixing them up with yogurt or fat-free ricotta and a little&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Walden-Farms-Chocolate-Syrup-Low-Carb-12-oz/dp/B000PZQV08/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Walden Farms Chocolate Syrup (Low-Carb) 12 oz</a>&nbsp;or other sweetener.";positive
"I'll be honest, when I first received this bag I was curious to how long it would really last me.. But I've had it for about two months already, using it at least once a day, and the bag doesn't even seem to be half empty yet! It's obviously great quality, straight from China.

The bag lasts forever because it is potent enough to where only a quarter to half teaspoon is necessary for a large 16 oz glass of green tea. Great hot or cold, although I typically drink cold or blend it into protein shakes or smoothies. Even blended into yogurts, pancakes, etc.

AWESOME price compared to other places, tastes authentic and strong, lasts a while. Will definitely order from again! Thanks!";positive
Very good San Marzano tomatoes.;positive
I truly am in love with this mix! Great taste, cannot tell the difference! My son loves the pancakes and banana bread from this mix. Too bad it is not dairy/casein free...or else we would still be getting it!;positive
"Ordered these for my girlfriend as a present. She loved the smell and flavor of all of them. This being said, I never got to taste them but the smell was fantastic. They each were great in there own way.

Side note: The box and designs on them are very cool. Definitely a tea I would want to have on my counter top.";positive
This was so DELICIOUS!!  What a scrumptious treat from Germany!!  It's 10 little packs, but boy is it yummy!  The wafers make it light and airy, but then there's this rich cream, and wrapped in chocolate!  I meant to take a photo of it, but then I ate them all.  I better order some more!  It arrived on time and I think it was worth every penny!!;positive
Perfect for a quick snack;positive
This is my favorite Nettle Tea. I have been suffering from a chronic case of Hives and this tea really helps to keep the rash and itching in a reduced state. A nice surprise is that it tastes  good too...similar to a good english tea but more mild.  I sweeten it with liquid Stevita brand Stevia. I have tried Alvita brand and Traditional Medicinals Nettle Tea but I like this the best and seems to do the most good.;positive
Great nuts, great price.;positive
Use them in my trail mix.  Great!!!;positive
Works for me;positive
While I prefer my own homemade version using very similar ingredients, I do enjoy the convenience when I'm in a hurry. I find I need a bit of sweetener - usually matcha powder - and I do keep a couple containers of this oatmeal in my desk drawer for those times when I find myself hungry or working through lunch. I just heat up my tea kettle and add the water. Easy to prepare, pretty good tasting  though if you're not used to eating seeds and nuts in your oatmeal, prepare yourself to chew it a bit more that typical packaged oatmeal products. I personally love the seeds and nuts ... my husband, not so much. But, that's a personal preference. I can, without hesitation, recommend this product.;positive
"The beans are great, not mouldy and will make grand vanilla.  I only got 23 beans instead of 25.  I am very disappointed about that.

UPDATE:  Sent an email to the company and they have already sent the replacement beans; I promised tyo let people know if I got satisfaction and I am quite happy to report this company is worth 5 stars!";positive
Great tasting mints;positive
"Compared to other cacao nibs that I've tasted, these are probably the most blandest I've tasted.  Less chocolatey than the Terrasoul version, although just as bitter.  It has a tiny bit of the banana nut taste of that I find in the navitas version.  I probably won't be ordering again as there are much better cacao nibs out there.  Not worth the extra few dollars saved.
Don't get me wrong, these cacao nibs aren't bad.  They still taste okay if you like cacao nibs.  But if you are used to higher quality versions of cacao nibs, you probably will be disappointed with these.";positive
"I don't like decaf coffee; it usually tastes somewhat less coffee-ish than real coffee. That, and I have an ongoing obligation to oppose whatever is trendy. I prefer coffee strong enough to take the chrome off a trailer hitch. But I can drink this stuff in the morning and not even realize it's decaf. Bar none, this is the best decaf I've ever had. Full-bodied, good flavor, and strong enough.

Note: if you like coffee which will allow you to see the bottom of the cup, don't buy this in more than a sample quantity. It's likely to be too strong for you.";positive
Caribou is my favorite coffee. I love this brand, but have recently discovered that my local store carries it for 1/2 the price of what I can find it for on Amazon. Beware before buying online. I pad about $24-$25 for 2 bags, but locally can get 1 bag for about $7;positive
