This isn't Jumpman!!! FAKE SONG;negative
This was an accidental purchase.;negative
why did he have to drop the F$%* word??;negative
It's okay for me.;negative
"i  never received my order. It is not in my music library in my kindle. ;(";negative
Don't like it;negative
this song its the best worst song and the cars where better it had a better way of showing the 1960s off though;negative
Somehow doesn't work for me. Too many similar and overworked songs. Waste of money. Jusy buy the BEST--and skip this mess.;negative
I like the music but the sound quality is poor.;negative
This was just okay. Not the best. It really could have been better,like if the songs were full songs. they sounded nice though.;negative
I wish I could tell you about this book, but I never got it.;negative
Didn't like this song too much.;negative
double purchase;negative
...if you're gonna like it.  A blind sample of this, and I didn't like it.  It's not my type of music.;negative
boooo! worst Floyd ever!;negative
not as good as original;negative
I have no idea what this is...I never ordered this.;negative
this was a purchase for my boyfriend so i can't really say but its ok to hear it ever once and a while;negative
Really like it.;negative
This is ordered by mistake-was not what I wanted!;negative
THANK GOD THE POWER HAS FALLEN!!!!!;negative
This collection was okay,not the best. It could have been better and I really wanted it to be better. just eh.;negative
I didn't mean to buy this song I don't like it;negative
Hard to hear the music over the annoying sound effects.;negative
"Not a fan. Price ok song isn't. Like i said ""Not my kind of music"" but it was free and some of my friends may like it.";negative
I didn't like this album.  I have it one listen and that was enough for me.  I will stick with Type O Negative.;negative
not as good as I hoped it would be;negative
Glad it was free. I would not have paid for this. He was better at pop songs rather then Christmas songs.;negative
Stop already.;negative
This is a good song if you like Lady Antebellum,;negative
Not club nouveau....... this is the Timex Social Club. Don't buy it!!!!!;negative
Not my type of music. Downloaded by mistake;negative
I like her voice, is excellent. What I don't like is the lyric.;negative
I'm disappointed. I love this cd but when I played it was super scratchy and I couldn't enjoy the songs.;negative
bought for mom;negative
Good buy from Amazon.;negative
Wasn't horrible but not for me.;negative
THIS IS A OK SONG IT WAS EASY TO DOWNLOAD WITH NO PROBLEMS AT ALL  THE ALBUM MIGHT BE OK I DONT LIKE ADELE;negative
Garbage, for the children!;negative
again down loaded the wrong song, sorry.  I'm confused to as why there's so many different copies of this one song on Amazon?;negative
Didn't down load the song I wanted which was I want crazy... I got some other down load that sucked;negative
didnt sound like beyonce;negative
Love album but sound is terrible can't believe the record company dropped the ball on such a good album;negative
"Again, not my type of music, bubble gum pop style doesn't do it for me, and adapting it for
dance doesn't help.";negative
stops in the middle of the song;negative
"B SIDE OF BLOOM ? ;(";negative
I like the original song if I would have known it was this tiesto's birthday I will not have purchased it;negative
Awful Quality for this song. I thought it would be better.;negative
cant understand what hes saying;negative
I love this song but this rendition isn't the best. Not in my opinion at least.... But everyone is different.;negative
everytime I play it, it cuts off the end...Not sure, was that how it was recorded? or did my download mess up?;negative
Two songs should not be melded as 1 if they are as different as this. Instead,they should do 1 or the other.;negative
Seems to have been well received. The selection came off of their wish list so I expected them to enjoy it and they did.;negative
"I didn't order this, no clue how it showed up on my ""write a review"". So it gets one star.";negative
Yeah,  yeah.  Boring.;negative
purchased the 3 album set, didn't even bother opening this one, the other 2 were not good;negative
GET A PRAISE!!!!;negative
purchased for someone else.;negative
MUSIC NEVER FORGOTTEN;negative
Did not like very well.;negative
Waste of time and money.;negative
I DIDN'T LIKE IT COULDN'T UNDERSTAND THE MUSIC,WOULD LIKE TO REMOVE FROM MY DEVICE. But most  people WOULD find interesting.;negative
there is no reason for me to be excited to listen to music. it is not caring to certain individuals and;negative
heard it on a documentary and thought the chorus was cool but not really worth the listen when it cycles through on the ipod;negative
Bought for a client. Not my taste;negative
This was not the version of summer madness I had intended to download.  I'll try again next year to correct.;negative
It may be a good song to others depending on the genre of music you like but it just wasn't my thing.;negative
"Not Taylor's best work; I only bought it because it was cheap, and I wish I hadn't.  Not a song on it I really like.";negative
no music is better than some of the music you hear nowadays. music just sucks in general and doesnt work for me.;negative
"Don't download just this song, you only get the tail end when they are singing the ""do do du dupe"" part.";negative
I love the song but the quality of the recording is lousy --I can hear the bass more than I can hear the lyrics!;negative
I DID NOT KNOW THAT THEY WOULD NOT HAVE CAPS;negative
this is aweful and I love the lips;negative
I thought it was the same version as the soundtrack to the movie;negative
It old and got sick of it fast;negative
Bought this for a work function, not for me. I am sorry that I could not give a more in-depth review.;negative
only 1 song i like;negative
I love that we can download music so fast and it is available online for free storage and great service.;negative
just not my type of rendition.  Thought her voice was a little weak, but maybe other things she's done is better.;negative
i bought it because i wanted to see what the heck everyone would not shut up about. now i regret it;negative
I saw this on Zach and Cody and I was like yeah this is my Jam but Jesse is not rad and not popular.;negative
Why this was even on my list of items to review, I never downloaded it.;negative
I don't like it;negative
A lot of money and next to impossible to install well.;negative
I don't need it.;negative
Very disappointed!;negative
Long dreary. Similiar sounds..  Looking for more of him.... I'll try again..;negative
I'm sorry, but this is not a song. It is noise condensed into a format that can be played on any media player...don't get!;negative
This is not old school, It is for the young and energy driven. Good dance music not just for listening.;negative
Just awful, waste of $$. Skip it.;negative
The music is pretty good, but what upset me was the tracks are out of order. It just took me out of it.;negative
Not the ORIGINAL CUT, SO DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS.;negative
I just didn't care for this arrangement.  I'm sure many other people will like it very much. It's been deleted from my music.;negative
I would not get this unless you are Jewish.;negative
What happened??;negative
"not my favorite Brittany album but it was okay overall.
would not by it. Maybe just borrow it from the library next time.";negative
Not really a good Mary cd;negative
I don't remember purchasing it maybe it was a request for a song that I had to have for a party;negative
Has a nice beat and is easy to dance to. I give it a rating based upon my tastes. Your mileage may differ!;negative
I don't have any idea about this. I don't even know who this is. so I cant rate it. sorry.;negative
Another DOUBLE purchase - wish songs would be listed and NOT ALBUMS - causes too many DOUBLE PURCHASES!!!!!;negative
Sorry redman delivers a lackluster and just dreadful piece of work hopeful his muddy waters 2 will live up to the hype;negative
"Discovered that I can't stand her voice. Only plays in Amazon app or on mp3 player; not compatible with Apple products.";negative
Everything great thanks much;negative
Too sad.  Must be a liberal;negative
Purchased by an ex-friend who figured out how to hack my account 4+ years ago.;negative
overated. I don't know why I bought it.. I feel stupid... but what can I do now right? lol so yea...;negative
like the music but the lyrics are Satanic and I'm a Christian;negative
I wasn't expecting a Hip Hop style Boy George. This wasn't my cup of tea, so I deleted it immediately.;negative
Purched by mistake.;negative
thought I liked it but it gets old quickly. oh, this is an old song. Dah. I have it on my oldies list.;negative
Bought the whole album and only listen to once song.;negative
This had alot of static in it.;negative
"Liked it; but now I'm kinda sick of hearing it.";negative
Its way too mellow and the guitars are pretty much non existent so its pretty boring;negative
Didn't know there was like an interview at the beginning and end of the song.;negative
I had all sorts of tech issues. The music itself is great.;negative
Don't care for it.;negative
"I;d like it if I could listen to it?";negative
Not the full version.;negative
I do not like this singer;negative
Out of all of her songs, this is her best one, and that's not saying or making anything better.;negative
"I don't know where all these songs went...
There gone.";negative
Sorry but......STUPID !! Song;negative
My mom made me order this crap;negative
I really was disappointed by the song;negative
I did not find anything special here, mediocre, nothing kept me listening to it again & again, so deleted it.;negative
i did not buy this so not sure why i'm asked to rate it.. Can someone explain why i have to rate it as a purchase I made?;negative
Not my favorite kid Rock cd. Worthy of  a list to though. Album NOT fun as last slbums.;negative
This was a replacement CD and made the same error at the same time.  This time asking for a refund. Bad stack of CDs was made.;negative
I'm clearing off my review list. This was a purchase for someone who WANTED it. Thus, they liked it. I personally am not a fan.;negative
Really bad CD;negative
After loving this song at first it has now become the most annoying song ever.;negative
Part 2 is pretty unnecessary. Just go get Part 1, and you'll be better for it.;negative
Just not my type of music. If you like metal you might like this! Music is all a personal choice and mine isn't metal.;negative
"This is good listening music for the young; dancing too I guess. Too young for me but I still recommend it.";negative
song is OK, not really my style i guess.  I didn't enjoy it but if this type of music is your thing, than go ahead.;negative
Free download..  kinda blah, but can't resist free...  lol;negative
I thought it was a cute commercial song and found out that this particular song didn't cut the mustard for me. Sorry!;negative
This is one of my favorite songs, but the sound quality is HORRIBLE!!!  Save your money & buy this song from another source.;negative
For what it is its good but it's just not my style.;negative
Didn't realize that this was an Elvis Costello project! T Bone did what he could with it! 20 tracks/18 songs of Folk/R&B! Thanx!;negative
not what I expected, just not my style;negative
Remade, NOT the original!;negative
It wasn't that good;negative
Corey Taylors voice= Just awful. Could use some more chest voice and less nasal screeches.;negative
Sounds better online.;negative
Old, but it is one of the originals and so it is good dance music as well as sing along.;negative
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THESE SONGS ARE STILL IN THE SYSTEM AND I CAN DOWNLOAD THEM AGAIN...I DID NOT RECEIVE ON MY IPOD.....;negative
"It doesn't work, I bought it 2 or 3 times
This was a digital purchase";negative
the music industry relly sucks in the sense that there is no. music industry sucks really bad there is no;negative
Just ok,not really my style. Some songs should not be messed with too much and think this one was overdone;negative
Didn't get the correct song. Got Guys Have me You instead;negative
song skips so I don't enjoy it;negative
downloaded for a friend... not my thing;negative
"A beautiful song, but it's full length of five minutes plus is
not achieved, so I will only give this song a one star only.";negative
It ain't fun.;negative
"It""s just OK.";negative
I imagine that this would be nice if it was a whole cd,but from what I heard I just thought it was okay.;negative
NOTHING LIKE iTunes reliability;negative
I got this as a gift for big fan of Pink Floyd, but they were sorely disappointed in this CD from Roger Waters.;negative
very disappointed in this version and not worth the money look for a more traditional rendition of this song song;negative
This was not my favorite rendition of over the rainbow.;negative
8 out of 71 keepers.;negative
I like Twisted Sister original music but didn't think this was their forte.;negative
Just the same words bunched together,  incoherently.;negative
I didn't like a single track from the album.;negative
Not the original;negative
Just ok. This is like listening to an unknown ok pianist. Nothing special or inspiring here. Skip it this time.;negative
I absolutely hated this song and I deleted it after listening to it once!! I wouldn't recommend it to anyone 8o(;negative
once i saw the video, everything i felt about this song changed..;negative
Problem with upload and purchase redundant. copies;negative
I ordered this song by mistake on my phone i was looking for another song so sorry i was looking for something else;negative
I downloaded it.;negative
Had to buy for a video!;negative
Can't figure this one out.  I got it with something else but I never listen to it.  I wouldn't recommend it.;negative
Did not purchase this book either or whatever it is - did not purchase this one.  Cannot rate it.  Sorry.;negative
This is a fun song to listen to while I clean house or work out. So there you go, folks.;neutral
bought this for a friends daughter's funeral!  Not a big fan of Billy Joel but bought this for my friend.;neutral
This song is alright. I got the album on a whim since it was free and I realized this isn't my kind of music;neutral
when i heard this song i thought it was funny because it was comparing love to bunnies so i would laugh every time;neutral
got it for a greatest hits cd for pop. loved it when i was younger.;neutral
It brings back memories, maybe some I try to forget.;neutral
Was okay not crazy over this CD...;neutral
not their best song, but good enough;neutral
not crazy about it;neutral
Brian Culbertson offering  pretty good.;neutral
Pretty Good for 20 some odd years later, but nothing like the original.;neutral
This is a nice track and I like that he teamed up with Taylor Swift and Keith Urban. Good listening.;neutral
Relax and enjoy the music;neutral
Slow and sad.;neutral
This song has some very interesting lyrics and entertaining lyrics but not a song that I listen to any longer.;neutral
Very good song.;neutral
You may or might not like this I prefer to wait until the album comes out I think the album is very good.;neutral
I liked the message of this song. The harmony was nice. It made me think of something you 'd expect to hear from the Gaithers.;neutral
Just to add something current to the workout mix. Not classic material and will be forgotten in time.;neutral
Children would love it, selected for the children.;neutral
It's ok takes ya back a few years when music was fun.;neutral
some not clear sound recordings;neutral
It is not the movie version, the ending was changed substantially and the movie one was quite a bit better.;neutral
I was not to pleased with my purchase, but will give another try, I know that I will find something I like.;neutral
It is what it says it is.  I expected more than just the bowl.  Not here.;neutral
didn't remember that it is slightly creepy even though I like the melody etc...the Doors went overboard with the macabre;neutral
Good song. Slow ballad.;neutral
Great album from one of my favs;neutral
Wasn't as good as I had hoped but would buy it again.;neutral
Nothing jumped out and grabbed me, but a few nice tracks. Seems we've hit saturation in music, nothing new or breakout here.;neutral
It's awesome!;neutral
like both artists--this song ok!;neutral
I like this song, it is worth buying and spending the money on.  Instrumentals and the vocals are great.  Good lyrics. (wife);neutral
Ordered by mistake.. Too riskey;neutral
Christmas is my favorite time of the year any music will do but I like more of a traditional carroling cd.;neutral
The song is done nicely, but not one of my favorites.;neutral
Just what you'd expect.;neutral
I love music instrumentals and this was good, not the best I've heard, but it does a nice job at getting me to dance.;neutral
Ordered for my husband as one of his favorites.  I personally can take it or leave it.  Just mediocre for my taste.;neutral
Not my cup of tea regarding gospel.;neutral
It's Kansas.  They weren't what I'd call OMG great, but they're ok.  Don't know why I have this on here twice.;neutral
Not as good other CDs TSO has produced.;neutral
Was a bit too long for me.;neutral
Some bands from the eighties and my teenager years are just not what I remember them as...Still good have;neutral
i like this song its good actually;neutral
When I first heard the song was on the radio, sounded a lot better before I bought it and d/l it!;neutral
I would probably rate it higher if I actually had it downloaded.;neutral
nothing special about this album he stays in his simple lane.;neutral
I liked it. Definitely doesn't rate with the best music I've heard though. Would recommend giving it a listen though;neutral
I like Carrie Underwood's version better;neutral
ITS OKAY FOR A SONG.;neutral
Has a nice beat and is easy to dance to. I give it a rating based upon my tastes. Your mileage may differ!;neutral
What can I say, I got into the worldwide craze when the song hit the clubs and radio a la 'Macarena' from the '90's.;neutral
"Good music from Amazon's ""Freebie"" section (at least it was when I got it).";neutral
Good song. I use it for my walks. Tends to fade out occasionally.;neutral
Cool, but a bit preachy at times.;neutral
The song will take you away from where ever you are and submerge you in the sound. Enjoyable to space out to...;neutral
Semi-OK acoustic pop but not a great artist, not yet anyway.;neutral
"Good song; very catchy.";neutral
actually this is sort of weird, good beat, high pitched male voice is odd;neutral
melodic, soft and subtle...not usually the words used to describe Rihanna, but this new sound fits her well.;neutral
It was nice and I'm glad it was Free;neutral
It's ok there is only one song that I liked on this cd.;neutral
Another fine vocal performance by Bobby Rydell.  Not as upbeat as some of his other hits, but still a great song.;neutral
It was alright;neutral
All I want to do is give this some stars.  No description is needed to make it sound any cooler.;neutral
another weird but ok song;neutral
Worth the money.;neutral
Don't like Miranda, only listen to it because of Carrie.;neutral
its a great sound to a night of party or a get you moving sound tech style that sounds addictive;neutral
I would say anyone who enjoys country music would enjoy this song! Zac Brown Band is one of the better newer bands.;neutral
It's not bad, but a little too slow.;neutral
its okay i only like lil waynes part;neutral
for granddaughter;neutral
Very good song, mediocre voice with a few flat notes that lend character to a song and lyrics that question the events of life.;neutral
I knew this song.  It was what I expected.  For a friend.;neutral
exactly what I expected;neutral
Enjoy a good nights sleep with this wonderful music that relaxes you & allows your brain to shut down & tune out the world.;neutral
Needed for a mix dating to a year, not my fave song, now that I hear it again. Quality of song recording is good.;neutral
I just bought this song because my husband likes it.;neutral
I felt like there should have been more to the delivery to this song, but it's nice to listen, every now and again...;neutral
Bloop! Bloop! Glorble!;neutral
I once had this song a while back, I just couldn't put on my computer.;neutral
I have several versions of this song. Each of them are different, but similar. I like the soft version of this song best.;neutral
this song will always remind me of the hangover I just loved it in that movie and it's the only hip hop or rap song I own;neutral
classical Haydn is good but not everyone does it good;neutral
It was ok, it isn't my style of music but how can you complain about free. I listened to it a few times.;neutral
Enjoyable. cannot sing to it though as my tone is way too low and flat.;neutral
Song is anointed and I love this version but it cuts off too short, would like the whole song.;neutral
its OK for the price;neutral
Its like half great songs, half meh songs should have picked the ones i liked out instead of buying the whole thing.;neutral
It was ok but not my usual style. Good lyrics but a bit off the norm. Ok for a casual listen but not a steady diet.;neutral
Not bad, chick style song.;neutral
Overplayed on the radio, but I still like it!  Catchy!;neutral
good dancing song for events;neutral
Not better than her mixtapes. Could have had better production.;neutral
A freebie from our friends at Amazon.  I always enjoy a good freebie, it is a great way to try things.;neutral
I thought it would be better.  It's got some good songs, but that is about it.  I don't know if I would buy all of the album.;neutral
It's OK. It was just not my style of music to listen to.;neutral
A very nice little track for your collection.  I wish the bit rate was higher.;neutral
Kid Rock needs to go back to rock/rap.;neutral
Good song, but the quality could have been a little better. Not bad by no means, but not great either.;neutral
Well, I loved their first two albums, but as bands do, they evolve.;neutral
great song song;neutral
"Good rap song , pretty much a standard format type song in the ""Too Short"" paradigm.";neutral
a fair album was not in it as much as I thought I would have been;neutral
Kind of sad great tunes.;neutral
Good buy from Amazon.;neutral
Son likes song... I do not.;neutral
Excellent Product;neutral
It is a much, much shorter version than I expected.  Would have liked it better if it was like the radio edit.;neutral
I want to like this guys' talent. So far, only two songs made the cut for me.;neutral
I like it but so far haven't played it a lot. I am sure I will in due time. you are pushing my buttons;neutral
"This is an okay song.
It isn't what I expected when I bought it.";neutral
Beautiful song;neutral
Bruno Mars Has a Lot Of Good Songs And I Have Alot From Him, His Music Is Great For Clubbing And Listening.;neutral
Catchy, creative song about an unusual subject.;neutral
Eh, disappointed...;neutral
Okay.  Same sound as the first album.  Some songs okay, some not compelling.;neutral
It was alright music, just wasn't what I was looking for. It's possible that someone else would like this CD.;neutral
Catchy catchy;neutral
Forgot how good they sound;neutral
Nice jam great voice;neutral
Its ok. I just got it because it was free on veterans day. Its just not the type of music I listen to;neutral
"It worked, but it took some editing to get rid of baby noises. That was my only disappointment; I love the song otherwise. :)";neutral
If R&B is your genre, this is a winner. Give it a listen. You may like it. It is a good song.;neutral
meh, so so......truth meh;neutral
not what I expected, just not my style;neutral
It has a few memorable moments, but it doesn't have the same power as some of her older CDs. Shame really.;neutral
Must have gotten this one free.  Not memorable;neutral
Does it really matter what I think?;neutral
This is the slow version of the song. I bought the wrong song. Be sure this is the song you want.;neutral
Now I know why I only have one disc of his.  Not great not bad, he is a singer. Not much more I can say.;neutral
A good song that was on the radio a good deal, very recongnizable;neutral
It's a good look at you so;neutral
The singing is a little off key but I like the band;neutral
The beat is good, not a fan of the lyrics.;neutral
She does a good job but i'm not sure it's a style that i like BUT it is something different.;neutral
Free download;neutral
It was an Ok tune.  I wish the bit rate was higher.;neutral
also like this one as well;neutral
not my type of regligous music it ok;neutral
used to make a greatest hits cd for my dad. sounds awesome.;neutral
Nothing outstanding here.;neutral
Very hard to hear it;neutral
This was not what I was looking for but it was no to bad, it just was not what I thought it was.;neutral
This was not the song I was looking for so I was disappointed, but it is OK.  The error was mine totally.;neutral
The beat is great, Nikki's verse is okay.;neutral
Got this son for a family member;neutral
IT'S OK THANK YOU;neutral
A catch tune...;neutral
this is allright. this song is not the kind of music i usally listen to.;neutral
The old Zorba the Greek song. Not as good as the newer version. But still OK if you like that sort of thing.;neutral
Wasn't the version i wanted... there is an extended version... be sure the songs you are wanting are on this one.  :(;neutral
If you are not listening closely, it's pretty good.  Price is right.  Celtic music is kind of all the same though.;neutral
An original can never be replaced;neutral
It's okay. Different, but not great or ground breaking.;neutral
It was free and worth a listen, though after I had I was not enamored with the artisit or the tune.;neutral
Awesome take on a classic.;neutral
Not great but some great moments.;neutral
Not really music, more like  noise.  While  not offensive,  it is really calming either.;neutral
Ok other than the curse word;neutral
Bought for someone else.;neutral
I like this song. It isn't one of my favorite songs by her, but I have it so I can listen to it sometimes.;neutral
This song is a bit long, but we played it at my husband's funeral.  It was just ok.  Very old school southern gospel sound.;neutral
Both my husband and I enjoy the music, it gets you going.  The words are okay, but the music is a lot of fun.  Good. Good.;neutral
Great song. Bought it and downloaded it. Horrible sound quality.;neutral
A gift for my daughter. Don't listen to this stuff. Not very country to me;neutral
It's fine. Nice tune.;neutral
"Love Brooks & Dunn, this is a really good country album, good
enough to call it Brooks & Dunn";neutral
I liked Liam Finn and Eliza Jane. They play very good music and are a talented group. She has a good voice.;neutral
Really like the radio version of the song, so thought the extended would be nice...it's ok, but just very repetitive.;neutral
I like this song but for me it is too slow. I'm sure it is better that way just does not appeal to me at that speed.;neutral
A decent choice for working out at the gym, for sure!;neutral
The history of Christian music for a dollar!  Too much of it is very grave and of course, not in English;neutral
Not a fan, I decided after purchase. My fault.;neutral
It's been a long time since I've listened to this song, so I got it and it still sounds good.;neutral
Great product and packaging was great . Perfect music for the holidays and it is worth the buy . Merry Xmas;positive
Ive bought two versions of this song , version with Nicki Minaj , and version without. I like the version with her much better.;positive

This isn't from a live or concert, it's a studio version. It's the one I always hear at the bar or for karaoke.;positive
Great christian hip hop;positive
Fab music, very roots.;positive
No other can sing like this man...;positive
Just a good feeling, make you want to put on your boots and dance kind of song! I play it alot.;positive
Music review is based solely off of personal taste.  Just because I like it doesn't mean you will.  I love this one.;positive
Song my husband has been looking for, for a very long time bought it for him;positive
This is one of the greatest songs out of the trip hop era.  It's been out for awhile but it stands the test of time.;positive

Love this song.  Love Katy Perry!;positive
Kurt Cobain does this old blues song justice. Not one to miss.;positive
Excellent Choice!;positive
This song is one of my absolute favorites.  If you download this, it will be one of yours as well.;positive
The group who produced endless hit songs still can bring me to tears and fill me with emotion.;positive
Great rock an roll music;positive
and remembered how much I liked it. I can depend on Amazon.mp3 to find some of my favorite old music;positive
Wow! Awesome song. Thank you.;positive
Great 80s slow jam!!;positive
a very funny - well sung - song about vengeance for cheating;positive
Wonderful  and inspiring song.  Love it.;positive

Love this song by Jackie - love the video also. As always Jackie delivers only the BEST!;positive
Never get old hearing this song, classic;positive
Will enjoy it like the other Tim McGraw songs.;positive
Where country comes from.  Straightforward, sincere.  They say Ray Price owned a lot of stuff in Nashville: he earned it.;positive
I love this song another one that makes me laugh.;positive
Another must have Dylan tune;positive
This is an oldy but a goody.  I like a lot of Journey music, but definitely this one.;positive
I REALLY like this CD.  I highly recommend it!!  A definite must buy if you are a Matthew West fan,;positive
love being able to find old music. It is the same as I remember from listening to the old 45's.;positive
Album #3, 5th CD of different material finds Ms. Rae returning to the more soft soul/pop of her glistening debut.;positive

love this song for a long time. now have it on my Ipod. thanks!;positive
Love this version of this old hymn.;positive
It is a great song but I do not remember the extra sound effect features that are in the biginning of the song and through out the song.  I tried to order from another album, but had the same effects.  Not like the original I remember.;negative
Good;negative
I didn't care for this sampler as it did not do the trick for assisting me to fall asleep. Maybe someone else might have better luck with it.;negative
Lucinda sounds appropriately sedated or intoxicated....thru most of these vocals.....I am really trying to find some deep down poignant  original songs cutting to the heart...but frankly these are mostly retreads from earlier efforts....For me her last great album was West....since then we really get a mixed bag often uninspired, often shadows of greater performances and songs.....However her version of the Woody Guthrie's song  is illuminating....so in sum this is just another ho hum effort....too bad....;negative
Not my thing;negative
Not rock;negative
"Love the song ""Demigodz Is Back"" so it made me want to pick up the album on sale for 4 dollars. Sadly, There was not a single song other than that one that I liked on this album. It was just a generic rap album that failed to have any stand out tracks on it.";negative
But after awhile her whining just gets on your nerves. I bought it listened to it for a week or two and then deleted it out of my library and I'm happier without this song.;negative
song was great Amazon does NOT let you download the MP3 more than once. So IF you happen to delete it or LOSE it like I did by aaccident. You are screwed. Will not buy MP3 from amazon again.;negative
"1 is not for song itself but for the clean version which still contains the ""B"" word defeating my whole purpose for buying this version.";negative
"Do you remember that old philosophical debate, about whether a million monkeys pecking random keys on typewriters for a million years would eventually produce the works of Shakespeare?  Kellee Maize's work reminds me of that, though as yet she hasn't produced much that resembles music (not lyrically, anyway).  She's apparently had the big insight that lots of words rhyme with each other or sound a lot alike, and thinks by stringing them together something profound may result.  Well, not quite.

Using big words that rhyme does not an artist nor poet make.  Gosh- consonance, continents and consequence DO sound a lot alike, wow.  You can visit any mental hospital and find dozens of such ""visionaries"", what they produce is called ""word salad"".  It's gibberish, utter nonsense.  Ms. Maize is either unbalanced or having a good laugh at our expense, possibly both.  There's nary an original thought here, no- strike that- there's not a THOUGHT here, not one that's coherent or complete, at any rate.  The words SEEM to suggest things, like a verbal Rorschach test, words randomly thrown together DO, but the meaning is imposed from without, a projection, as they say. Granted, the tunes are catchy, the beats infectious.  But if you see anything profound and revelatory in the lyrics, I suggest you Google them, and have a look some Sunday morning, in the clear light of day.  I warrant that YOU are the source of your epiphanies, the inspiration and beauty comes from within, not from Ms. Maize's ramblings, which are alternately pretentious, gratuitous, and in poor taste, to put it mildly.  In fairness though, why this strikes me as rubbish and songs like ""COME TOGETHER"" or ""I AM THE WALRUS"" by the Beatles strike me as genius, I don't know (LSD way back when may have had something to do with it, admittedly, in this case, so who knows).

BTW, what is an ""aligned archetype""?  An archetype is ONE facet of a person, one of many that complements other facets, their confluence or amalgam forms personality. I could have made some sense of ""aligned archetypes"", plural, its use in the singular is baffling- how so, aligned with what?

Below are the lyrics to Something Sacred.  I had to work around the obscenities, Amazon wouldn't accept them.  Some might think it a travesty, an insult to the things that people actually hold sacred to use the word thusly.  ""Something Sacrilegious"" might be more fitting.  Neither sacrilege nor obscenities bother me in the least, actually, but utter twaddle taken as profundity does, especially when there's so much out there that IS profound, explicitly so, like THE AVETT BROTHERS or LOVERS or HOLY GHOST! or MATTHEW DEAR, for example. I'll give you a million dollars if you can cogently explain the meaning of this song to me (well, not really, I don't have a million CENTS). But here are the lyrics, judge for yourself:

SOMETHING SACRED:

Alliteration for the nation, consonance for continents
I hope the consequence is that you bob your head to this

Justifiable rythym
Asking what you been missin'
Pimps so corporate n' kissin
Values are tied in the lynching
All the fat needs some pinchin
Steady youth in a prison
No lovin' supervision
There's no cooks in the kitchen
Poison water no fishin'
All the sales men are pitchin'
To steal cause circumcision
[Sexual assault] us continue snitchin'
Money drugs over [female dogs]
I see something real different
I'll be holdin' a vision
It's not just superstition

Something sacred sewed me sideways
I'm Mirrored, mimickin' and movin' my way
Holy hell on a hardened highway
Feeling freaky focused
Friday to Friday

I'm fighting my ego
I think may be it's sequel
Is opposite of evil
Sugar f***ed up my equal
Never researched the prequel
Toxins all in your fecal
Poppin' pills swelling measle
Tell me where is my people
They don't bow at no steeple
Lightworkers gettin deepa
Quantum physics'll teach ya
My lyrics they might reach ya
Read the poems I preach ya
This full length is my feature
A mysterious creature
We are one blood all keepers

Something sacred sewed me sideways
I'm Mirrored, mimickin' and movin' my way
Holy hell on a hardened highway
Feeling freaky focused
Friday to Friday

My spaceship is leavin'
Out the window I'm seein'
End of left brain per diam
Psychics say they can see them
Daddy's fightin my demons
Beside me steady dreamin
That he helps me make freedom
From the grave he is screamin
F! the man and his s*men
Kinda fishy no reason
Corporation is reakin'
Smells of workers well treated
Earth mother she is fiendin'
For a break in the season
Discontent no one pleasin'
Called a [female body part] that is bleedin'

Something sacred sewed me sideways
I'm Mirrored, mimickin' and movin' my way
Holy hell on a hardened highway
Feeling freaky focused
Friday to Friday

Alliteration for the nation, consonance for continents
I hope the consequence is that you bob your head to this";negative

"Do not confuse this album with those by Artist:  Christian Gospel Choir....as did I.  Unless you like gospel music instrumentals done in the old ""Big Band"" style that calls for an image of a Vegas show........stay far...far away from this one!!! The few vocals are not worth the disquieting of the Spirit.";negative
"If one has listened to and understood the brilliance of drummers like Art
Blakey and Elvin Jones, it is hard to get excited by a drum machine, and
although there are great musicians out there that sometimes use them successfully  (Beck and the Eels immediately spring to mind) most times they just sound synthetic.
 Chan Marshall has an amazingly rich, soulful,and dare I say organic voice and is a great songwriter, she has worked with some of the best musicians this country has to offer including some of Al Greens backup band, why on earth would she opt this time for a synthetic, cheesy, euro-disco/trip-hop sounding record?
  The Albums Moon Pix and You Are Free are masterfully spare, soulful and creative gems and although I would not want to stifle an artist's need to explore, this album seems to defy her very nature. Her voice and lyrics, her strengths, seem to get lost in the mix, the synthetic music does not support those strengths but overwhelms them. Perhaps she can opt for a costume of raw meat and make the transformation complete and get an interview on 60 minutes.
  To me this is, tragically, a 2 star effort by a 5 star artist, but it is a 5
star disappointment.";negative
I don't like it cause it's not for me. If someone like this song, I will tell them about this song,so they can download it for them else.;negative
The production value of this disc left me cold.  Great songs, but did the producers skimp on the budget or what?  Get a drummer with some real chops to liven this up.;negative
I am a 3 Doors Down fan, but I didn't like this album.  It seems like they have tried to go another route, or are tired of each other, or who knows why they changed their sound, but the songs have lost that rock edge that I've loved so much in so much of their other music.  I know that most people prefer the pop-ish songs like Kryptonite, but for me I love songs like Down Poison, which have a distinctively darker edge.  This album is missing that.  If you like the pop-ish songs you might like this album, but if you don't I wouldn't get it.;negative
I just found this album to be very hoakey and unoriginal. I was not a fan of it at all. I was not very familiar with this artist and just bought the album based on the positive reviews....won't be doing that again any time soon...;negative
thought this was something else. boring song. thought this was something else. boring song. thought this was something else. boring song.;negative
A HUGE let down. After the first song the rest of the album was bad. Heroes for sale was my favorite rap CD ever so to hear this was a HUGE let down. I wish I had better things to say about this album but then I would be lying. Hopefully the third time will be the charm.;negative
I like that Amazon offers wide variety of free music it gives me a chance to listen to artists or genres that I might otherwise pass by.;negative
This tune is okay but it isn't destined to be a classic. I got this one during a buying spree and use it as a filler for burning discs, I could have been more selective but its okay.;negative
Excluding the Gary Cherone misstep,  I equally love both incarnations of VH.  But, this is horrible. The VH3 sound in good form, but DLR really ruins it with his God-awful pathetic singing.  He owes everyone who's already bought this a refund.  I played it once, and then tried a second time, only because I couldn't believe it was so bad the first time.  It was on and off the iPod in less than 24 hours. Now sitting on the shelf collecting dust.;negative
I like that Amazon offers a wide variety of free music it gives me a chance to listen to artists or genres that I might not otherwise pass up.;negative
Truly stupid.;negative
I didn't realize that there were two versions when I bought this one. In my opinion the acoustic version is much, much better! This one she sings quicker and it just doesn't have the same feel.;negative
"This is a beautiful song, however, the name of God, nor the Lord Jesus is not mentioned one time. I consider this a beautiful song but not a gospel song. But that's just me. It seems like something appropriate to AA 12-Step program which acknowledges  a ""higher power.""";negative
I gave this download only one star because, even though it did download into iTunes on my p.c., I could not get it to sync into my mp3 player as I did with two other songs I purchased from Amazon.com:  'I Can Only Imagine' by MercyMe, and 'All of Creation', also by MercyMe.  If your tech support team can help me with this, I would greatly appreciate it.;negative
Ambrosia Anthology had the same songs plus many more so it was a far better deal. I thought I might get a better quality sound but it was the same.;negative
this Club Nouveau/Timex Social Club greatest hits on Thump records is all rerecorded vocals by a different front man. Sounds awful. AVOID.;negative
"Sorry, but for me this is a commercial and basically pedestrian effort that sounds similar to other music of the current day, sung like many songs are sung by young singers; a bit of a diminishing of such a great voice, but younger fans will probably love it.  No goosebumps here, and that is a first for me with a Jackie E. recording.";negative
I got a lot of songs off of Amazon that were free and I didn't like any of them, including this song.  I guess it was worth the price.;negative
Some tracks seem like the same as the last one. A lot of Cricket chirping in quite a few songs. Guitar strumming is a little too loud to be considered Lullaby material. I think this would keep a baby awake not help it go to sleep. Not soothing enough in my humble opinion to be considered a cd for kids. Maybe for older adults while there awake but not for trying to fall asleep.;negative
Could not get this to download.  Kept getting error saying download failed.  This is a waste of money.  Don't buy if you want to download to your computer.;negative
This is the worst sleep music I have purchased from Amazon. It is just the same 5 minutes of music, cycled a dozen times. And the music is too intense for a sleep aid.;negative
like most of the songs i download i heard it on a commercial on tv and thought it was good after downloading it the song got on my nerves could have used my dollar on something much better!;negative
Decided to try it after hearing the short piece off Amazon. Some Soul I like but this is not one of them. Not quite sure why, just had no appeal to me.;negative
Don't like it;negative
Poor quality;negative
"It's a cute song, sung by a 15 year old with a catchy hook, ""baby, baby, baby...""
The beats and instrumentals are extremely catchy.";negative
"...I'd be reluctant to give any sympathy - it does generate some emotions though - teen angst and all that goes with it.

"My only gripe is that the quality on this ""remastered"" version sounds almost identical to the original compilation I bought a few years ago on Rhino. If you're buying for the music, it's a great starter set...the remastering, however, is insignificant on this release.";neutral

I heard a song on the album The Heist and was impressed by the lyrics and the blend of two types of music. The song I heard referenced this song so I decided that I wanted to hear it. I love the lyrics and the blend but I was made aware of who exactly it was that I was listening to and  I lost interest quickly. There was no good beat to go with this song so the best thing about it was the lyrics. However, I am stumped as to what he means when he talks about two styrofoam cup. Is he talking about cough syrup? I am lost. Is this a new thing or what?;neutral
"The Beatles' audition for Decca Records is presented here in mono. The Decca Audition tracks that do appear on The Beatles ""Anthology 1"" release are in slightly better quality than here. But this release is acceptable, and should fill that empty hole in your Beatles collection until EMI decides to release the complete recording. This release also includes the three Lennon/McCartney compositions, which are frequently missing on the many bootleg albums these recordings have appeared on.";neutral
I really like the song stylistically, but the lyrical content though well written, is so shallow and pathetic. The words are so empty and selfish. But hey, it's right there in the title. I say it's time for more loving lyrics. I know it's about strength and taking care of yourself but it takes so much away from the poor guy the song is about. I tried to listen to this song three times after two and  half times I became unreasonably down (jk).Please no more...;neutral
Just confused why each song costs even with prime music.  I also do not like that I cannot put music on my phone or copy to CD for listening in car or on stereo.  Wish I could.;neutral
"This is a Christmas gift for my son who I am sure will love it, but there are some great old time style rock and role tunes on here that even I enjoy. ""Cocaine and Gin"" is fantastic and I also particularly like ""Redneck Paradise"".";neutral
I decided to try this song because it was available for free on Amazon. It's the perfect summer song, very mellow. My only complaint is that they sound almost exactly like Three Doors Down, but I like 3DD, so I guess that's OK.;neutral
These 50 songs will randomly play throughout my day. It is quite lovely and for the very inexpensive price, you can't be the deal.;neutral
I can't explain it because I really don't like this song but I like it. Maybe it's the musical beats that work while the lyrics need some work.;neutral
Like everyone else, I got hooked (much like bad drugs?) on this song when it released. Then--like everyone else--the novelty factor wore off and now I almost cringe when I hear it. But it was fun while it lasted!;neutral
Nothing on this album really grabbed me. It felt more like writers block strained to make an album. If I didn't know it was Alanis Morissette  I would have never guessed. For me it's probably a one and done. I may listen to it again but I doubt it. It certainly can't stand up to Jagged Little Pill.;neutral
"Jason Derulo may forever be trying to recreate his number one smash 'Watcha Say'. Why wouldn't he? After all, the Imogen Heap sample was quite brilliant, with his vocals more built around it rather than the other way around.

'Don't Wanna Go Home' samples two different songs, leading to a bit of a desperation to earn a hook. However, it works here, due to the more obscure nature of the two tracks in question, and the fact that they are integrated a bit more subtly than on 'Watcha Say'. The lyrics don't lend anything new to the pop music scene, in full-out party mode since what seems like the dawn of time these days (or before Tik Tok became the seventh most downloaded song ever). With that being said, there's nothing wrong with this single; it will easily propel Derulo into the Top Twenty once again, as it seems to have already done.

The bottom line is that Jason Derulo's new single is a good, faceless piece of pop worth dancing to. It's not the song that's going to earn him any credibility or establish his image, but it is going to keep people from leaving the party early, and that's all he really wants to do anyway.";neutral
"I use three stars because I realize I have no real talent to judge these.
However, I do enjoy them tremendously. They are clear in tone and sound and I listen to them constantly. Please understand I am talking about a variety of these collections. All sound good to me.

And they are very affordable. The performers may not be famous but I imagine they are, in fact, superb by any ordinary standard. I cannot believe my good fortune in finding and trying them.

"This latest effort was good, but for such an established artist, it just seems like he created music that was a break from his standard practices.  Had this disc been released directly before or directly after WHERE I WANNA BE, then it would have fell right in and fitted perfectly.  However, now that we're at this later stage, it seems a little out of place for me and him.  Half of the disc has his stamp on it, but the rest sounds like it could have been performed by one of those ""up and comers"" trying to break into the industry. Don't get me wrong, again, it's a good cd.  It's just that it would have probably been a better cd if it had been released 5 to 7 years ago.";neutral
Ok cd;neutral
I really enjoyed this as it is one of the ones we sing at devotion in church all the time.  I added it to my small collection of gospel music that I listen to while I type.;neutral
I got this on special, 21 tracks for 89c, at that price I can forgive some blandness. Yes, it does sound like Muzak. Works well enough to round out my already massive Christmas tune collection.;neutral
"I read the reviews for this song and it was applauded by everyone as being a great rendition of the song.  I have been a Johnny Cash fan since I was 4.  My dad gave me Johnny Cash albums every year for Chrismas and I am a great fan of the man in black.  This rendition should have never been released.  I understand Johnny was sick and declining in health but this isn't even close to being a good recording.

You can pass on this one unless you just have to have everything Johnny put out.";neutral
It was okay.;neutral
HELP just isn't for me. Some great songs but some that I could just live without. That's unusual for a Beatles album as far as I'm concerned.;neutral
"I can see why people argue and don't like it. It's not like their previous albums. It's a lot more popish and doesn't really have that original sound we are use to having in their albums. It truly lacks the Head and the Heart. I mean I bought their previous two albums years ago and I still go back to them because they have that depth. It's not just the quality of the music but the heart and soul that clearly went into it. I don't think that Signs of Light has that.

I think with Signs of Light, as it is their first major record label release, they are trying to reach a wider, mainstream audience and because of that, A majority of the album really comes off as radio ready pop hits. Not to say that they aren't solid songs but again, They lack that heart and soul that went into previous works. And by doing that, I really do think it isolates their original core audience and that's pretty evident by the reviews posted for the album.

Signs of Light is a solid album and certainly worthy of 3 stars but it doesn't have any lasting quality. Once I go tired of listening to it, It's just gonna chill on the cloud service for a good long time.";neutral
Good band;neutral
"While not as immediately catchy as ""Teenage Dream"", ""Prism"" is still a likeable pop record that is easy on the ears and doesn't play around too much with the format that has made Ms. Perry successful over the last few years. Though for me the one off-note was ""Unconditionally""--I'm sorry it just sounds odd--like she's been told while she is singing the song that they are going to add an extra syllable onto the word because it makes a better chord progression but when you hear it, it just doesn't sound quite right. Why couldn't they just leave the 'ly' off and go with unconditional? Either way, this won't make too many new fans but regular listeners will eat it up, much like I did.";neutral
"I've been around long enough to have heard many bands from which Joywave have taken their musical cues. So, this music is far from being original. But, I see there are some young reviewers who have given this debut five stars. I just can't do that. This band has a ways to grow before I'd give this five stars. Five stars is classic, landmark, cornerstone recording. Is this ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band""? Is this ""The Joshua Tree""? Is this ""Dark Side Of The Moon""? No, no, and no.

Joywave sound like they're trying too hard here. I guess I thought their debut would be better based on the song ""Tongues"". When I heard that song months ago, I sat up and said, ""Who's this?"" There was something about that track that reminded me of the best 80's New Wave bands with a modern twist. But when I bought ""How Do You Feel Now?"" I was greeted with ""Somebody New"" and ""Carry Me"" opening the album. Neither of those tracks did for me what ""Tongues"" did. ""Destruction"" was interesting for a minute but quickly turned annoying. ""Now"" was okay. ""Parade"" and ""In Clover"" were okay. ""Feels Like A Lie"" and ""Traveling At The Speed Of Light"" were weak. Did we really need a seven minute meandering track like ""Traveling At The Speed Of Light""? ""Nice House"" is, maybe, the only other track on this entire album that I felt came close to the interest I had in ""Tongues"". ""Bad Dreams"" was weak.

So, I once again say, this is a band who has potential, but it wasn't fully realized with ""How Do You Feel Now?"" I'm not sure they'll get the chance to make another album or two, but if they do, they need to go back to the drawing board and re-think their musical strategy.

""How Do You Feel Now?"" was just okay. It wasn't special or unique or innovative, but neither was U2's debut, ""Boy"", and look at how far they went. In the end, I give this album two and a half stars, which is being very nice--two and a half stars means half of five stars--or average. Just average.";neutral
"The best part of the song for me is when she says ""This is your world aint it"" and she's talking to Wayne

I'm like- did she just say it's Wayne's World?

And then I laugh, way way too much.";neutral
I love a lot of Rihanna's tracks, but I am usually turned off by the lyrics.  I love to hate her music.  Great beats and horrible, forgettable lyrics.;neutral
I had a problem and could not download the song to a disc and Amazon was kind enough to give me credit. It was to be  used to sing track in church and was of no benefit.;neutral
I got to hear this song on a radio station and liked it, so I purchased it. I don't know the meaning of the lyrics but I like the way the song plays.;neutral
I love Avenged Sevenfold but this song is by far not their best. Only if you want to get the whole Hail to the King album get this song. They have alot of better songs then this one Hail to the King, Carry On. So Far Away, Nightmare are some that i would rate 5 stars. For $1.29 its worth the money for sure.;neutral
Pop;neutral
The lyrics are a story that George Strait tells so well, and pulls it off.  I don't care for the ending where he tells her that it wasn't his chair after all.  I didn't like that part at all.;neutral
it's alright;neutral
This disc seems sort of flat. While Groban's voice is still good it doesn't seem as if his emotions are invested in each song. I feel he could have done better if he got into the character and the words better. I'm a little disappointed.;neutral
i like the music more than the rapping but its a good sampling choice that goes good together it gets a little more play than others;neutral
Funky;neutral
This is okay - I like some of Britney's music.  I am glad that she quit being in the headlines as a crazy and bad girl.  She has a God-given talent to sing and beauty - let's hope she keeps it together.;neutral
This song embodied the ideals of many of the flower children -- a revolt against the complexities and dehumanization of our highly technical and speeded-up world. It's among the songs I use like some people use their favorite benzodiazepine.;positive
This is what I listened to when I was in high school!!! They were short & to the point! Music was happier back then. If you like Golden Oldies, this is a good pick!!;positive
great tune;positive
relax;positive
Classic jam.;positive
Thank you Amazon! I love making all of my music purchases with Amazon because I know that I can listen from ANYWHERE I that I have Internet access. And on most occasions it is either the same price, or cheaper, when compared to Apple - which is another added bonus.  Needless to say,  I am GLAD that I turned from Apple to Amazon for all of my music needs!;positive
I am not a radiohead fanatic. I own the bends and ok computer. I love both of those albums. I am not a professional record analyst either. I do know a classic album when I hear one and this one is definitely a classic collection of beautiful songs that must be in any music enthusiasts record collection. Packaging is pristine and pressing is absolutely perfect. This record came to my house along with the new red hot chili peppers record the get away. I was so depressed after listening to the get away I couldn't imagine how the radiohead album would make me feel. But I slapped it on and my mood instantly began to move upward and I was so happy to hear the sound of tom yorkes voice sing so incredibly angelic. Please buy this record and experience this amazing feeling of happiness. Cheers!;positive
A good song;positive
Timeless.  One of those songs that if you catch it on the radio or someplace you will find yourself here on Amazon and buying it.  If your shoulders doing start to swing n sway then you are likely dead :-)  great song.  Great price.  Don't think twice.;positive
LUV IT  .;positive
Though they did not produce the plethora of hits that some did, this one, their initial offering will certainly go down as a great one no matter who you want to compare it to.;positive
I'm not much for hip-hop or rap, but I like this one. It's funny, clever, catchy and well done, even though Tone Loc sounds like he had a cold when he recorded it (or maybe that's just the way he normally sounds. I have no idea). Quite enjoyable.;positive
Love this woman so excited and glad she is making music again. This song is everything......it's amazing and I look forward to the full album.;positive
In the Still of the Night. Perhaps my favorite song that Ronnie Milsap has ever recorded. His version of the Five Satin's #1 hit of 1956 evokes the Doo-wop sound of that era and the magic of being with one's significant other while Mr. Milsap's version is playing it the background. Truly a masterpeice.;positive
Simple. Goofy. Fun as hell and a great party tune that will get folks up and dancing. Long live the Village People. I've never seen such a talentless group of musicians who produced such great sing-along songs. I want you as a new recruit.;positive
Very nice song, that makes me be bop all day long. Makes me believe my day is not so bad because somewhere in the world, someone has it worse then me.;positive
Maybe not my favorite renditions of these songs, but good, nevertheless.  Makes for good background music.  Well worth the price.;positive
What is not to love about this young man's prowess in the music industry! This may be his best yet. I love the flowing mix of R&B with hip hop in this trendy track and I totally recommend it for any party lover. Love you forever, Chris Brown.;positive
Great item!;positive
I had never heard of Ivan & Alyosha, but Amazon had this song for free, so I thought I'd give it a try. It turned out to be a great song! I love the melody and harmonies and am looking forward to finding more songs from this group.;positive
While reading book Real, this song was brought up a lot. I love this song! I miss the Goo Goo Dolls. I am so glad that the book brought up this song. I immediately downloaded it for my Kindle/computer. They were fantastic in concert. Their albums rock! I especially love this song!;positive
"""When I call your name"" came on the radio, I would listen to it and try to sing along.  It is beautiful but haunting song.  Vince Gill was little unknown country star; however, this song made him a star.  I would played and played this song so many times that I wore out my cassette.";positive
One of Michael's good ones which I always enjoyed listening to.  Nice, easy sound.  I play it from my cloud player on my Kindle while Im on my computer.  Love it;positive
Dang Amazon.  I used to live quite comfortably in my cocoon.  Now all the songs that really hit you are available.  This is one.;positive
"This is Prince ""LET'S GO CRAZY LET'S GET NUTS. I wonder of all the songs this man did that are locked up in vaults and never released how many more exceptional hits would he have. He also wrote song s for many other performers.";positive
Measures up to the hype!  I especially love the studio version of the Present Tense.  Must have for Radiohead fans and anyone interested in creative new alternative rock.;positive
Great, high energy instrumental Christmas song. Starts out nice and haunting and then kicks into a powerful, high energy rendition of classic Christmas music.;positive
Rock on.;positive
I believed she has tried to change her music also. The shouting style has gotten old. She's a beautiful woman and has great talents. It seems to me the newness of her music is going to lead her to more recognition. Not that she needs it. All the older stars are doing the Madonna thing. Remaking themselves and their music is more pleasant to my ears. I give her an A here. Now if she wants 5 stars she needs an A+.;positive
"Once again Mishara has given us a sampler to introduce us to new artists  that is vastly superior to the typical sampler. I do have an interesting observation. Maybe someone can tell me if Barnaby Bright's ""Reverend's Son""  borrowed the chorus from Gillian Welsh's ""Caleb Meyer"" or did they both borrow from some earlier tune?";positive
This is yet again one of his best songs before he went over the edge. I really think he could have had a better future if he had just gotten help.;positive
"I love Doo Wop and One Summer Night by the Danleers has always been a favorite of mine.

Listening it takes me back in time to when life wasn't so complicated.  Love was holding hands, holding each other and a tender kiss under the night sky that you hoped wouldn't end but knew it had to.

It was slow dancing and dreaming about the future you were sure you were going to share with that summer love you'd found.

No oldies collection is complete without this classic love song.";positive
My anthem for the moment. Not a big Beyonc fan but she can usually get my attention with at least one song on her album/cd. She has my old behind flexin on my ex in the mirror and making hand gestures to her words, anticipating the chorus so I can give my ex the middle finger. Beyonc did good with a girls anthem for Spring/Summer 2016. Thanks Bey!;positive
Only thing I hate about buying these mp3 song is it goes on one computer and that's it. I broke my computer and even though I bought this song I can't listen to it no more.... :( sad and disappointed... good song though;positive
I heard this in Twilight but didn't listen too closely to it.  I found it online and really heard the lyrics.  It is so nice and sweet, and powerful.  I really like listening to it.  The singer is amazing!;positive
"BEAUTIFUL SONG. ESPECIALLY FOR SOMEONE CLOSE TO YOU THAT IS GOING THROUGH HARD TIMES. WHETHER IT BE MENTAL, PHYSICAL, FINANCIAL. JUST A GREAT SONG TO LET THAT PERSON KNOW ""YOU WON'T LET GO "" !";positive
Let me start off this review by saying I have not yet seen the movie but I LOVE the soundtrack! I never buy soundtracks because I usually don't listen to them very often but Pitch Perfect is one of the movies for which I have made an exception. The music from this soundtrack is outstanding. The songs cover several genres including rap, country, blues, rock, and pop and they are all sung by various a capella groups. I enjoy almost all of the songs on this soundtrack but some of my favorites are the Winter Wonderland/Here Comes Santa Claus medley by Anna Kendrick and Snoop Dogg and the Riff Off by the different a capella groups. I'm from Wisconsin so of course I am very interested in the songs sung by the Packers! The soundtrack is approximately 44 minutes in length so it's fairly short but it's packed full of excellent, fun, and catchy music. After hearing this soundtrack, I am very eager to see the movie. I would highly recommend this soundtrack to anyone who enjoys fantastic a capella music!;positive
Blake's rendition of Micheal Buble Home is done excellently.  It's a fabulous song and he holds true to the feeling.  I can imagine any traveling artist or anyone who has to travel for a job with a loved family at home can relate to this song.;positive
This is such a good song, I can't get enough of it. It's another one of those songs with that laidback mellow groove and an awesome vocalist with that smooth style that matches the song perfectly.;positive
GREAT LOVE SONG---I HAD NOT HEARD THIS SONG IN YEARS. I JUST HAPPENED TO HEAR IT ON A LOCAL RADIO STATION AND KNEW I HAD TO ADD IT TO MY PLAY LIST. GREAT LOVE SONG!;positive
